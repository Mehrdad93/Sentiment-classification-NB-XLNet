0,"The hotel position is very good, center of the town. The Hotel services are not comparable with the Mercure standard, particularly the cleanless, quality of the rooms, restaurant... are not fine for the quality standard of Mercure hotels. People at the reception are very nice and helpfull. Price is too high for the hotel level.",2
1,Not a very big room but very comfortable and clean. Next to the underground and to the famous check point Charly. In the center neighborhood of Kreuzberg. And all for a good price. A good  option to travell to visit Berlin,4
2,"The hotel is located near Kurfürstendamm in a quiet side street. It'sYes very big, comfortable, very good price for the quality you get. Spacious rooms, polite service. Only complaint: Air conditioning not perfect. ",4
3,"My booking was for 2 rooms and I have made the booking through Accor website under my own Le Club membership. I have requested non-smoking rooms as part of my booking and specifically asked online to see if I need to call ahead. I was told no. At check in I was told there are no non smoking room available. I had to spend 10 min asking for a manager and another 10 min for the manager to realise I was NOT kidding and would not accept anything else. I found it incredible this day and age, and at an Accor facility no less, that I had to beg for an non-skoming room. FInally and grudgingly the manager did an upgrade for us so we can have this basic request met. However the manager were also interested in when we can check out the next day and when I told them we shall be gone before…",2
4,"Excellent hotel, fantastic swimming pool, very warm welcome, great atmosphere, friendly staff. We stayed for one week in the presidential suite and we were delighted with the facilities. We strongly recommend this hotel.",5
5,"the location is a little away from city center, but you do have metro station and public transportation close by; I am staying here for business purposes and it would not be my choice for holidays; rooms are fairly small and the comfort is approximate; it is a little noisy. bathroom are tiny. breakfast is fair as well as the price. staff is friendly.",4
6,"Location to museums is terrific and so is Max's staff!! The breakfast options are hearty and delicious!  Now, here is the deal:  the rooms are tiny and are not air conditioned. On the 4th floor with all windows open and fan provided, the room is really stifling. The double beds are smashed next to the wall so you need to climb over your bedmate to get out. There is a lift to all floors EXCEPT THE BREAKFAST ROOM WHERE YOU ALMOST NEED TO TAKE YOUR LIFE IN YOUR HANDS TO DESCEND. It is on the lower level.   Finally, and this is really important...the street is completely under construction with loose dirt and dust everywhere.  You need to park or more likely double park a street away to load and unload your luggage.  There are steep steps into hotel.  If a staff person is available,…",3
7,"The room was large, contemporary, which means cold and please don't stay too long. Which for a short stay it was okay.  The bed was very uncomfortable, but the for the rest , it was roomy, and in a great location.  So for me, one or two days...  nothing warm and homely about it.  I would go back again for a short stay.   The girls in the office were wonderful and checked us in fast and upgraded us and were really nice.   We went to the breakfast and it was the same thing, cold and not that friendly.  But as we travel through Portugal we realize, that is trend, it is business only, get the job done.  not open like I'm used to, and that's okay.  But the whole point of a hotel is to have a good bed to sleep in., but they were really clean...  Price is good for what you get.  a few…",3
8,"Modern hotel just like most modern hotels, no soul and individual character. The hotel is close to the sea, beaches and shopping malls. Further away from the city center. Tram and metro few meters from the hotel makes it easy to travel. Rooms well equipped and clean. Bathrooms clean. Good breakfast buffet. Staff polite and helpful.",4
9,"I reported a maintenance issue with the air system that was making an ungodly noise. It was so bad, I could not sleep. I reported it the next morning as I left for the day. When I returned later that evening,  it was still not fixed. The only way to remedy was to turn the system off- making it hot and stuffy. This is not the type of service I expect for $750 a night. ",1
10,"the bathroom was amazing - perhaps my all-time favourite.   It was hot and humid in Shanghai, and our room was over 30C when we returned from a day of walking. The air conditioning struggled to get the temperature below 27. A call to the front desk resulted in a visit from an engineer with abysmal customer skills and no effect.  It took a number of post-midnight irate conversations to extract a fan from the inexperienced duty staff whose only contribution was to assert that all the rooms were at the same temperature It's a pity that a great building can be let down by basic engineering and basic customer training.",2
11,"stayed here for 3 nights with Family - Booked a double and Twin Room - Double was 2 single pushed together - although nice and comfy - did have tea and coffee facilities however we had sachets of coffee , 1 sugar and 2 creamers , not many of the staff understood English - and they were not very helpful - to get about and see the sights you had to use Public Transport - you can purchase tickets at the Hotel - No one told us this - we found out on the Underground",4
12,"This is a very clean and very well located hotel - in a nice area and safe area, with surprisingly good access to a large variety of good restaurants. Also - not far from the shopping area of Ku'damm. One thing missing - no proper business desk in the junior suite. The disappointing thing is also the lack of free wifi in rooms - when you take to the account that Kurt Ritter, the previous CEO of Carlson Group, claimed that these days internet access in hotels should be free like the usage of towels and soap.  A very rare and unusual feature - safe boxes next to the reception (in addition to the ones in the rooms). The lack of drawers and wardrobe doors was making it look a bit cheap nowhere to hide your clothes, which makes things look a bit messy.",4
13,"Located in Vondelpark, the best park in Amsterdam and a bit far from city center and most tourist attractions, this a good clean hostel but with above average prices.  Check in was smooth and easy and upon arrival staff was very helpful and kind and gave me some tips about how to get around. This hostel offers clean premises and basic but nicely decorated rooms. Breakfast was included in the price but it was very simple: coffee or tea and toasts… Summing up: if you are short on a budget there are some better value options in Amsterdam",3
14,"Extremely disappointed. Don't bother staying here. We were charged are very high rate because of marathon weekend and regret ever choosing this hotel!  Outdated rooms.  Stained & torn carpet, poor lighting, burned out light bulbs, scuffed base boards. ",1
15,"Stayed here for three nights with my partner. Arrived a little early and was allowed to check in to an upgraded room for a small fee. Room was lovely, very comfortable and clean. Staff seemed a  stand-offish but nothing major. Spa facilities were a great add on and seemed to be fairly empty each time we used them which was nice. Hotel is right by the subway station and a few supermarkets. Hotel was also a good mix of male and female although I’ve saw some people mention it’s mainly male. Also be aware of city tax charged at the end of your stay, I assume this would be the same for any hotel although we weren’t aware of it. ",4
16,"We stayed for 3 nights at Chanteclair and were very happy with our room and our overall stay. Pascal (The owner) is lovely and made our stay very enjoyable. We would not hesitate to stay again, I've summarised the benefits and (very few) disadvantages below:  Pros:  • Very fair prices considering other hotels in the immediate vicinity  • Great location, very close to the beach, supermarkets & train/bus station (10 minute walk to each)  • Brilliant hospitality from Pascal, felt very welcome  • Rooms were clean (and cleaned everyday) with fresh towels provided each day   • Hotel was very secure, three doors (Entrance to front patio, ,main building entrance and room all lockable)  • Bathroom was considerably large and everything worked  • Lovely front patio with seating (Great to…",5
17,"Directly accessible from the S- and U-bahn stations, this brand new Holiday Inn is the perfect place to stay. I was there to just need a bed for the night: comfy, spacious, clean, modern. I recommend without hesitation.  The walk from WarschauerStraße is down a number of concrete steps and under a bridge. It honestly feels far less threatening than you might think, but I suspect the available lift/elevator to street level doesn't actually work.  The hotel has free, quick WiFi, and multichannel television as standard. BBC World didn't seem to work for me, though. Kettle and hairdryer in room, too. ",4
18,"I've travelled a lot in Europe and am accustomed to a variety of beds, showers, etc.  This hotel is cute, just a little ways out of town but walkable, and has the promised volcano view (though it is marred by an abandoned factory on the hill).  I would have been quite satisfied with the price I paid to upgrade to this hotel if it weren't for the rock hard beds.  I like a firm mattress, but these were so uncomfortable I could barely sleep.  After three nights we were both feeling quite sore.  The breakfast was OK, and the high-speed internet was nice, and the staff were friendly, though like most Greek hotel staff they seem to recommend restaurants where they have connections, not where the food is best.",3
19,"Stayed here for a 4 day break with 2 friends for our 50th birthdays. Hotel is in excellent location in the middle of Kudamm, lots of restaurants and bars in the vicinity , Kudamm is lined with high end shopping , fab if you have some cash or even for window shopping , busses , taxis , tour bus, Ubahn all within minutes of hotel . Taxi 17 euro from airport, good value .Rooms were basic but spacious and spotless . Although my friend would have appreciated the option of tea/coffee in the room . Breakfast room was bright and airy with outside balcony overlooking Kudamm which was really lovely . Breakfast selection was more than plentiful , great choice and all freshly cooked . Staff were most helpful and friendly and only too willing to give advice on directions and transport to…",4
20,"Staff are there 24/7 and are very pleasant and helpful. Good position for transport but out of the main hub. Restaurants , cafes and supermarket nearby. Bicycles for hire. The other residents seemed pretty quiet . Bit of a noise fromthe plumbing but not too bad. Our apartment was really just a big room with a bathroom cabin carved out of it .  Problems. 1.We could not control the temperature. It was pretty much always hot and stuffy no matter what we did with the ventilation controls. The windows only open a fraction so that doesn't help. 2. We had our son to dinner one evening .......only two dinner plates and two chairs? Really? That is a bit tight.  3.The TV had no world news channels. It was also at such an awkward angle it was uncomfortable to watch from bed or the ""living""…",3
21,"Had an amazing time here. Great atmosphere. Hasim was an exceptional host, always made sure we had everything we needed 👌🏾. The pub crawls are not to be missed. Definitely a good place to stay when you visiting Berlin. ",4
22,"What I liked: - the great view, obviously because the hotel is on a famous spot - the location, 15 mins drive from the airport, and you have great restaurants at Farani Street (just 50 meters from the hotel) - the room comfort, I slept very well every night whatever the jetlag  Why I won't come back: - Swimming pool open during work hours only (10am to 7pm) so wasnt able to take a well deserved swim after work. They should leave it open 24h/24 with eventually a notice to tell people that there's no supervisor out of those hours. - Very poor minibar with lowcost products. Was expecting few famous beers in brazil such as wals or hocus pocus but ended up with overpriced heinekein. Seriously, heinekein on a five stars is a joke. The rooftop bar didnt meet my expectations as well.…",2
23,"I am not going to talk about the obvious positives such as the awesome location, warm decor, decent sized rooms by Dutch standards, very friendly staff and the happening restaurant downstairs which turns into a fairly decent nightclub in the later hours.  But, I am going to talk about attention to detail which was missing during my stay. One by mistake (I seemed to hit ""the don't disturb light button"" accidentally and turned it off short after) and the other for no apparent reason, the housekeeping did not clean my room for 2 days in a row. Fortunately, they provided me with fresh towels during that period so I don't suffer further. Sheer neglect on their part turned my otherwise happy stay into a dreadful one.",3
24,"Pros: funky decor, decent sized room, modern facilities,  helpful reception staff, great strong shower. LOCATION was perfect for exploring the city  Cons: Ignorant bar staff. Saw we we waiting to order and then later waiting to pay but they continued talking amongst themselves. We were the only ones at the bar and they still didn't serve us. When we tried to pay, we got bored of waiting and so headed to the lift to go to our room and it wasn't until then that they shouted after us that we needed to pay! We did try!!!! Some room fixtures need fixing and coffee machine is too high!   If it wasn't for the poor customer service from the bar staff then I would recommend this hotel.  ",3
25,"New and fresh, just opened hotel with very cool common areas. Breakfast served a la carte, good choice and very nice staff. Rooftop restaurant food was also great. Thanks to Professional and helpful concierge Denis. The only one thing totally failed is room entrance through bathroom. Very unpractical.",4
26,"I have spend one night in Ibis republique, room was clean and comfortable, the receptionist was friendly and helpful. The hotel is located in less than 5 min walking from Metro Station the only problem was the room size which is very small but that's in most of Ibis hotels.",5
27,"This hotel does not know how to be a hotel. The staff are rude, closed the bar early and refused to serve us, and hung up on us twice when we called to ask about the lack of accommodations. Would never stay again.",1
28,"What has happened to this once great place? And its happened very quickly in my estimation.  Worst aspect is the food. The brekkie buffet on level 1 has food either cooked to death or raw and the general quality is down. The dinner was attrocius and in the club floor the snacks are also very poor quality, some being inedible - i am not joking - its rubbish i wouldnt feed my dog.  And as a club room you get fresh fruit - if you call half off plums and oranges fresh then yo cant be serious.   Even my chinese compatriots complained about the food so its not only me.   Airconditiong facia panels out of the ceiling, ducts with black stains around them and even a security camera hanging half out of the ceiling. Photograhic evidence i have.   And in the evenings and mornings its so…",2
29,"Stayed before on rooms ending 11 and the accommodations were good. For the same rate reception put me on room ending 08. It was a bad experience. The distance of the bed from TV was nearly 04 meters, ilumination was very poor. Not a pleasant experience.",2
30,"We loved our stay at First Hotel. All the employees were so friendly to us and helpful. And oh my goodness, the view was so amazing. I wish we had stayed there our whole time in Paris. As for their breakfast, we weren't able to eat in the morning as we had somewhere to be but it looked very fresh and delicious(eggs, fresh fruit, croissants). The room was also very classy and the bed was comfortable. Loved our time here and would love to come back if we visit Paris again.",5
31,"Super hotel right in the middle of Friedrichshain. Large, nicely decorated rooms, cleaned daily. Super friendly and helpfull staff! Great vegan restaurant downstairs. Couldn't be more pleased with my stay!",5
32,"This hotel has the world's thinnest walls. I have had better nights of sleep at dives in Central America & Africa. Upon arriving, I could hear music blasting through the wall from the room next door. I called the front desk & they sent up security to ask her to turn the music down. The woman refused even to open the door for them, so they had to send up a manager. (I could hear the whole exchange b/c the walls are so thin.)   I was switched to another room. Unfortunately, it was just as bad. The woman next door was on her phone for about 2.5 hours, until past midnight. I could hear her THROUGH MY EARPLUGS! I have never stayed in a hotel where you can hear what people in the room next to you are saying. If you want to sleep and don't want to bother neighbors when you talk, watch…",1
33," First of all very careless stuff, shower door was broken, i asked 3 time without result. 54$ for parking is a ripp off, just a few steps away there is one for 25$ overnight. They also charged extra $$$ as security deposit with a promise to refund after 15 days...??? Why??? This hotel is nothing but hassle. And to mention that heater/AC is as loud as diesel truck, good luck sleeping. Walls are very thin and you can hear how neighbors around are coughing, speaking, breathing. Never ever ever...",1
34,"Only for one night on a business trip.  Excellent checkin reception, with attentive and friendly staff, albeit late at night.  Fact that was not repeated at the time of check out, with unfriendly employee, mechanically working.  The hotel is in a good location with spacious and cozy rooms.  I used room service, with perfect resolution.  Extraordinary farm-themed breakfast, friendly and helpful waiters.  Bathroom with old and grubby towels.  In short: many positives, some negatives that deserve corrections.",2
35,"What a bizarre experience. Lovely hotel, placed conveniently if you are driving and don't want to risk running down a lunatic cyclist in the city centre, close to Metro. Great reception staff. Very well prepared rooms. Really surprised when I requested a fried egg with my breakfast only to be told that it would be an extra at €5 for each item not provided in the buffet. After we had fought off the mosquitoes in the public area we were in no mood to pay extra for a basic item in a cooked breakfast.",3
36,"I noticed a large spider on the outside of my room window, then in the morning there was a smaller spider crawling on the inside! I trapped the spider with a piece of tape and took it to the front desk where the manager scooped the spider up with a tissue and threw it away apologizing and telling me that she would take care of it. It looked as though she had done this before and did not seem at all surprised. The soiled linens and towels didn't help my impression of this hotel either! ",1
37,"Booked a package that includes parking for the 4th weekend, however when check out, the parking fee of $59 per night got charged, asked the front desk to check, and they (all three of them) said the package itself would NOT include the parking, and then asked me to show them the proof.  It's their published package on their website.  The internet connection was bad so it took me a while to pull their own web site out from my phone, in the meantime, they asked me to stepped aside to not ""interupt"" their work.  Would THIS be their work?  Then finally the website pulled up, and it says the parking is INCLUDED.  Only at this point, their manager came out and said, ah, I thought it is not included.  With the service (find a way to cheat) like this, though I am a HHonor member, will…",1
38,"Before arriving I had read reviews about how exceptionally clean it was, but I wouldn’t say “exceptionally”. Bed was a bit too small, the bathroom was decent. Not a great experience, but it’s an hostel, isn’t it!",3
39,"Absolutely loved the hotel, the staff were very welcoming, couldn't do enough for you. The room was very clean and very comfortable, maybe the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in! Rooftop pool was great to sit by and have a drink. The only one small downside was the quality of the water in the pool, it made me very ill as pigeons also swim in it, but great to be by, just don't go in. Other than that, perfect hotel, highly recommend.",4
40,Staying at the crowne plaza was amazing. We got a free room upgrade which gave us so much space. All the little details had been thought of with a note saying that anything you had forgotten they would supply which was a nice touch. The pool area was ao nicely kept. Pool larger looking than the pictures. The sauna area was lovely with extra loungers to relax out of the heat.  ,5
41,"We stay in Ibis Liberdade from Thursday to Sunday. The hotel is very good, quite area and just connect to the main street Avenida da Liberdade. Not too far from Parque Eduardo VII where can find city your buses. Price reasonable, room clean, well quipped, bath room good. For us, both are seventies, are too tire go back to the hotel by walk. Why ? Just like climb to the hill.",3
42,"We stayed there for 2 nights in May.  Hotel must have been beautiful at one time but right now it's old and tired. Preventive maintenance is not being performed, so things are falling apart. We had to change our room as there was an electrical problem there. We were given a suite which was dirty.   Breakfast was very good- nice variety.  No one on staff spoke English, so communicating with the front desk was impossible.  Shame on you Wendy Wu for using such a poor facility.",2
43,"The hotel is located at old town but not the good place fir us . At the arrival, the receptionist requested us to allow to block some amount of money and we said ok but they requested us to sign tthe credit card receipt which was never experienced before. We refused but finally we had to agree and it wasn’t very pleasant experience.The bar is located one flight down and the stairs  steps aren’t  very smooth . The house keeping staffs are not  pleasant( they didn’t say hello or any kind of greeting to the guest or smilr ) . there was no evening turn down service. The food and service in their only restaurant was great . This is the only good service we have to appreciate. When we check out , there is only one receptionist who helped us to bring down the luggage. No bell services…",2
44,My partner and I stayed here for 5 nights. The rooms were lovely and pool and surroundings amazing. But I would like to share some feedback regarding service and food.  We had 5 afternoons by the pool and not once were we offered food or drink service. I had to approach staff each time and not once a clean up or offer for more. It was windy by the pool one of the days and our empties flew away and still no clear up or service for another.  At one stage we approached a staff member for 2 Tiger beers. He brought them over - no smile - no friendliness- then proceeded to throw the bottle top on the ground (which I picked up as there are many kids around and bare feet). We then - on 2 occassions ordered Mojitos - both very different in taste and alcohol levels. The staff member…,2
45,"Of the several Peninsula Hotels I have stayed, this is second worse- worst was Beijing. The Shanghai staff and just rude and act as if guests are an inconvenience.  The rooms, however, are great.

47,"We have just spent 5 nights at Carmel Valley Ranch mixed reviews from us. The location and scenery was amazing, when we checked in the lady said it was up to us to make reservations. As we were taken to our room we were told we had an amazing view, we were excited to see this but when we opened the terrace door there was a massive tree! The suite was clean, the tv did not work, nothing in fridge but a disgusting smell. First night we dined at Valley Ranch food was magnificent. Breakfast was included in our package but not the best after such a lovely dinner. I visited the spa and was mortified with the whole experience, booked in for a Hot Rocks Massage 80 minutes was charged $252. I have never been to a spa and not been asked to complete a medical history/allergy sheet nobody…",2
48,"I made a booking mistake (my own fault). I mistakenly registered for 5 nights rather than 4 at the prepaid price (which is not changeable). Given the amount of money I'm spending and my history as both a Marriot and Starwoods rewards member, I was hoping to get a break - to which, by the letter of the terms, I realize I don't have a right . So they are within their rights to be rigid about this and I certainly can suck it up. However, this does sour me on the St. Regis (before I've even gotten there) and the Marriott, and Starwoods rewards programs.",1
49,"This hotel is huge. The reception, bars and restaurant areas are very large and ultramodern, which means long walks to and from the rooms. Some of the rooms are a very long way from the lifts indeed, along rather gloomy corridors. The bedrooms I saw were tired and jaded. Twin beds, no double. Scratched and worn dark furniture. Wardrobe doors ill-fitting so you couldn't open the internal drawers. Cracked tiles in the bathroom, emergency cord-pull over the bath missing, shaver point located dangerously near water, waste bin broken, loo-roll holder broken, loo didn't flush well.  There was an inter-communicating door with the next room with no bolt, just a flimsy latch. The food was all buffet, apart from one special gala dinner, and with very few exceptions, the vegetarian options…",3
50,This hotel was nice enough and easy to hop on the metro to Amsterdam central.   I saw this hotel was 3rd or 4th on the top Amsterdam hotels which confused me a little because they are just like student dorms- I know that’s the idea but I wouldn’t pay an awful lot to sleep in a uni dorm room so next time I won’t lwr my boyfriend book!  It was clean and spacious and staff were helpful- let me be clear there was nothing WRONG with this hotel I just don’t see why it’s been raves about because for the same prices we’ve stayed in much nice places with much more facillities.,3
51,"Had Christmas Brunch as the Fish House Restaurant on Christmas Day.   Out of many Brunch we attended worldwide, this had to be one of the worst.   The food was layout around the pool.    Food being hit by the sun, flies and birds.    Even a raw bar with Oyster's which could be extremely dangerous.   The selection was unimpressive as well as the layout.   the taste was nothing special and desert extremely poor in selection and quantity.   For Christmas Brunch costing $95 plus tax plus TIP was not even worth half the money.   However, it is not the money.  It is quality, food safety, and service that counts here.   The waiters were nice but the people attending the food was unfriendly at best.  Hard to get such bad service in Hawaii.   Before the Four Season's it was a Marriott…",2
52,"Its a nice hotel, close to the busy alexanderplatz part of berlin. The staff are helpful and friendly and go out of their way to make you feel welcome. Only negative points were lack of bath in the room and when I asked for a double room I got two singles pushed together. ",4
53,"One thing to remember for IHG group (which this hotel is part of) .... there is no added service for even a Platinum member.  There is no access to the lounge.  As for the ""privilege"" of ""room upgrade"" and fruit platter is really a joke and pale in shadow against the program from other hotel loyalty program.  The bed in the room (1105) I got is simply putting two large single bed together.  And even when I sleep on one side of the bed, the mattress is sunken in the middle and not supporting the body enough for a good night sleep.  Bad sleep.  Though it was not part of my Platinum benefit, I was invited to use the Club lounge and was lucky to still find something good in this hotel.  Their service staffs there at the lounge.

54,Recently spent 3 nights at this hotel. The hotel is convienent to the airport and train station. We used the complimentary shuttle that runs 24 hours on a consistent basis and I believe after midnight you must contact them for pickup. The staff was very professional and the room was comfortable.  Would stay there again if I visit.,4
55,"The Shangri-La is usually a very good hotel.  Unfortunately, the Shangri-La in Shanghai, which is supposed to be a non-smoking hotel leaves a lot to be desired.  The bathrooms were extremely smokey - you could see it hanging in the air and i even saw people smoking in the hallways and lobby.  Absolutely NO ENFORCEMENT.  Very uncomfortable for those who do not smoke and have problems with smoke and contact lenses.  I know China is difficult with this, but I have been in hotels in China where the smoking policy is strictly enforced.  If the this Shangri-La would do this, the hotel would have a better rating.  That was the only real issue.  and it was NOT an isolated event.  I stayed for 8 nights and it was a daily occurrence, even after I complained.",2

Check-in procedure was good if you skip on the receptionists talking bad about a previous guest and a tax for arriving earlier (two hours in advance and the receptionist lady said ""your room is already ready but you have to pay an extra tax to receive it). I would rather have heard that my room was not ready.   The room was ok, pillow a little bit too soft but I had a good sleep in general. Bathroom needs to be refreshed.

Concierge guy on Saturday afternoon had an…",2
58,"The hotel was in a great position being only 5 minutes walk to local buses and yellow or red hop on/hop off buses. There was also a free courtesy bus into town provided by the hotel.  Close by were two Spar shops and a Pharmacy.  We had a 5th floor sea view room with balcony.  Well equipped with plenty of storage, the most comfortable bed, coffee making facilities and frig if you wanted to provide your own drinks.  The bathroom was large and well stocked with toiletries.  Both bedroom and bathroom were spotlessly clean thanks to Sandra.  The hotel was modern with nothing to soften the noise which meant the indoor lounge area became quite noisy at times.  Breakfasts were excellent with good choice of fruits, cereals, hot food and breads and pastries. There was even free Prosecco.…",3
59,"This is how I reviewed the Henri IV Rive Gauche in 2012. And we've been back twice - it's now our go-to place.  ""Yes, the rooms are small, but this is Paris! The location is right in the center of everything, yet there was little street noise though we overlooked the busy Rue St.-Jacques. The staff, as opposed to what some others are saying, was perfectly nice and helpful the 5 days we were there in June. The lobby is charming, the room was clean and the breakfast was adequate. And the in-room Wi-Fi worked! Right near 2 metro stations, a short walk to many restaurants, across from Notre-Dame, etc. We would go back.""",5
60,"We found the room was very poor standard for the price, no air conditioning, the bathroom small and smelled of drains and the room was not made up on the second day. The breakfast was fairly standard but nothing to get excited about. The beds were confortable and the hotel well situated.",3
61,"Everything was super, the service, friendly staff but it has a big disadvantage and that is the music of the hotel bar. It's a hotel that has to decide what should want to be. A bar? Or a hotel? People go there to sleep. Don't go to the rooms of the first floor you will regret it. We haven't sleep much although they change our room to the 3rd floor even there the music was still annoying. All that can be corrected with a good insulation of course cause it's too bad for a new hotel like this to have this huge problem.",3
62,"What a gorgeous hotel in a gorgeous location. We truly had a wonderful short stay at Le Grand Hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful (and speak very good English and understood our attempts at French!). We had the most beautiful room with a sea view on the 7th floor and everything else we needed. It was immaculately clean and towels were replenished in the evening if we asked. Thank you so much for the lovely welcome gift of a bottle of champagne, which we drank on our balcony overlooking the sea - so relaxing.

We spent 2 days on the beach and reserved loungers on the front row and were very impressed with the service from the beach staff. We ate lunch at…",5

Very limited room service. Low quality amenities. The lobby staff were impersonal. I wonder there are better choices in Berlin in this price.But only some minutes walk from KaDeWe.",4
64,"Stayed here for 2 nights last month and was totally unhappy.  The only good thing about this hotel is the location. The air conditioner didn't work, in fact the room was heating up instead.  When we complained about it, we were not even offered a new room, but advised to open the louvered windows with no screens (what about the bugs!).  When we insisted on a new room, all the vacant rooms we checked had the same heating problems.  We also asked to talk to the Manager the following morning but never got back to us.  The room was also dated and the water pressure was really bad. We come to San Francisco mulitple times a year and we will not stay in here again, definitely worth it to spend a few more bucks and stay at the Radisson! ",1
65,"We stayed in the river side room for 3 nights. The view is superb! We were super happy every day we woke up :P The service is nice and the employees are helpful. The neighborhood is quite, so maybe not suitable for party animals. However there are still some beautiful bars around the hotel :-)",4
66,"This hotel is centrally located near a subway station and stores. This hotel does not deserve the star rating it has. It seriously is dated, the elevators are slow, the club lounge makes no accommodations for any dietary restrictions, the staff are genuinely ignorant and do not take pride in providing service. If you are looking for a place to stay in Shanghai go elsewhere, do not stay here.  Here are the top 10 issues I found - I could list more.  1) Hotel staff at check-in were cold and their greeting felt wooden, no genuine passion for the job - provide incentives to staff to care about guests and service excellence  2) The bed was too low and uncomfortable, lack of bedside outlets to plug in a sleep apnea machine - install more outlets or provide adapters with more plugs…",2
67,"This hotel isn't ideal for business travellers. It's location in the old centre is certainly great for the sights but travelling to the conference centre can take you a good 25 minutes in the morning and evening. The hotel is situated on a road that is not accessible to cars although it is only a two minute walk from where your taxi can stop. Unfortunately, during my stay the building next door was being renovated and even tough assurances were given that construction noise would not start until 9:00 am, it regularly started at 7:30 am and did not finish until 6:30 pm. Not pleasant when you're in room 405 immediately adjacent to the construction. Disclosure of that building work at booking would have provided a better customer experience. Aside from this temporary issue, the…",3

70,"Excellent hotel, great location, great staff's attitude, young and fun atmosphere. On our next visit to Berlin, we will return to this hotel.Close to the subway station, which makes it easy to reach anywhere. Many restaurants and shops, right in Berlin's main street below the hotel.",5
71,Friendly and very helpful staff.  They gave some really good recommendations on where to eat.    The location was close to most areas.  We walked everywhere (but I like to walk). Most attractions are within half a mile to a mile walking distance.  Convenient to public transportation as it is half a mile or less from Placa de Catalunya.  The best thing about this hotel is that they gave us a portable wifi and it was a game changer.  It was free (unless we lost it of course).  I wish more hotels would offer this.  It is a clean and nice hotel.  Wish it had a bigger rooftop or pool.  Our room was a bit small (for 2 ppl with big suitcases) and no external view - we didn't even realize we had a window  :) but we used a 3rd party site to book and you don't always get the best rooms…,4
72,"We stayed for 6 nights in the superior room. Bed was really spacious for two persons  and it was very comfortable with different types of pillows to choose from. Our room's windows were facing the inner courtyard, which was a good thing because the road's traffic noise was loud and would have definitely disturbed at night. Air conditioning worked perfectly and we enjoyed a lot of the pod coffee machine. Only thing that bothered us was that the room's were not soundproofed (as said in the room's information) and we could hear people from the hallway and the worst noise was loud thumps from nearby rooms when people were walking in their room. Luckily we had earplugs with us but definitely not soundproofed. So I recommend taking earplugs with you if you are a sensitive sleeper.  …",4

74,"The only good thing about this hotel was the location (and the view)- yes its right on Michigan Avenue. On the outset, the hotel was dark and dingy as soon as you get in.  Even the breakfast room / lounge was a very dark. The room was terrible- small and grotty especially for the price !  It was modern but very dusty and not functional. The 'closet' was a single door cupboard barely enough to hang our jackets- forget about the rest of our clothes.  The toilet was extremely small with no extra space at all and the towels were very rough.  The staff was helpful/ accommodating and did help us upgrade to a bigger room ( which we paid for ) but even that room was just very uncomfortable to stay in for 6 days !  If we were there for a night or two I would have tolerated it but for a…",1
75,"The hotel is located 15 min walk from Alexanderplatz on one of the big boulevards. However it is in the internal yard and second-row building after the street, so very quiet . After 9 pm reception closes and you should call on the phone to receive the PIN for opening the entrance door and another PIN to get the room key from a special safe. The rooms are very basic furnitured but the king size bed I had is of excellent quality. The breakfast is of good quality but the choice is quite limited. ",4
76,This place stinks like bleach everywhere. Staff was unfriendly and rude. Food was nasty and overpriced. The bed sheets had stains. The pool is like a dirty bath tub. I stayed in this place for less than 10 minutes and checked out because I could not stand the smell. Oh and valet sucks too. Place is only worth 1 star because location was good.,1
77,"While some of the architecture in this classic hotel is beautiful, the service is pathetic.  My wife organized a meeting with more than 100 attendees, most of whom stayed 2 nights. A suite was arranged by the host organization and  ""guaranteed"" to be ready by 3.  It wasn't. We went to their restaurant for lunch and waited 20 min for service.  Another room was ready by 4. For the inconvenience, they couldn't refund the lunch charges as they were not charged to our unavailable room.  Lame excuse.  Didn't really have a reason to buy anything else in the place so they basically did nothing for us. The room was large with separate bedroom and that was comfortable.  Too bad the key to the main room doesn't open the door to the bedroom so you can get locked out. As we had awoken at 4…",1

79,"The location is pretty remote, only thing close by is a gas station and a McDonald. The restaurant is extremely basic, pricing ambitious. My room was directed to one of the highways around, pretty noisy. No A/C so I had to keep the window open. Carpet in hallway looked like it would be cleaned once per month",3

If you have the chance please ask for a room at a lower floor as on the top is very, very hot and you must use the AC, which not everybody likes it! The hotel has no balconies. Location of the hotel is good - 7 euros taxi from the airport, so very convenient. 15 minutes walk to Pombal square, or 30 minutes to the Dom Pedro IV square. Breakfast at hotel is diversified. All other staff, except the first I mentioned was helpful and nice. WIFI is free!",3

The hotel is themed on music, with guitars, records and vintage music pictures decorating, It is in a quiet central district close to several metro lines, with good neighbourhood bars and restaurants nearby. There Is a free coffee machine in reception with good quality coffee available 24/7 and a good buffet breakfast. Would definitely stay here if we visit Paris again.",5
82,So my stay in this Hilton was ok the hotel room I had was very nice but the trouble started when I Checked in the price I was quoted ¥6529 or £758 but when I got my bill I was charged £798 they said it was a service charge.  It’s call RMB.  But the Service charge had already been added.  I also put in for a room upgrade but then change my mind I do not check my bill before I left I would've been charged an extra £120 as that was the bill they gave me first.  All I'm saying is please please please Check your bill before you pay.  They charged my card for £980 I did get the £200 back but it took three days.  As I said before the hotel Is a very nice place friendly staff but I don't understand how my bill said one thing and I ended up paying another thing. I am going to get onto…,2

The breakfast bar is limited, but the hotel is generally very tidy and the staff are helpful. The amenities outside the hotel are good for families and business trip and a subway is nearby. ",3
84,"Decided on staying here by a recommendation and I’m now another fan of this hotel. The staff is very friendly and extremely helpful in things to do and gathering information on any possible questions you may have for Paris. The hotel is down the street from The Pantheon and walking distance to Notre Dame. Lots of very good restaurants are nearby that are not ‘tourist traps’. The hotel itself has an old school charm without being stuffy or uncomfortable. In fact, the beds give the ‘big’ chains a run for their money in comfort! Water pressure is good and have extremely quiet a/c that I had to check to make sure it was even running. Wifi is also included.  The breakfast are very reliable with excellent fresh croissants, rolls, other breads, healthy selection of fresh cheeses,…",5
85,"I give it a solid 3 star. It was clean, the staff was nice and it is close to the center of the city. I am very impress with their energy conservation methods. Taxi service was amazing. Both time we needed one, they just press a button in an apt and taxi was in the basement waiting within 5 minutes.",3
86,Family run business. Nicely decorated rooms. Fantastic building. Excellent breakfast. Hope it will not sell to a big chain. So get out there. Spa needs improvement. But who really needs a spa of there is plenty of attraction out there.,4
87,We used the airport transfer which was an optional extra for this property and it was competitively priced and very efficient. The apartments are in a great location near to the underground (2mins) or a 15-20min walk into the centre of Barcelona. Artur's new restaurant which is next door provides lovely food if you don't want to go far though. The staff are very helpful and the view to the Sagrada Famillia superb. My only ( personal ) criticism is that a bath at the property would have made it ideal!!!!,4
88,"We loved this apartment style hotel. No faults at all. Great room, great facilities in the room! Loved everything, the room, balcony, kitchen... We missed only some laundry facilities, but you can not have it all. The hotel organise laundry for you but as it was a long weekend did not serve us, if we have sent the clothes on Friday we would get back on Tuesday... :( But this did not bothered us much. The location is good and bad... I would have preferred to stay closer to the party action (near Las Ramblas, El Gotic, Barceloneta) but at the same time is 2min from the main train station of Barcelona and you go anywhere by train... And a taxi wasn't too expensive! Great hotel/apartment!",4
89,"Having travelled and stayed at premium hotels all over the world you can destinguish the wannabe hotels who simply rest on their established name and their pretty rooms, to the hotels where truly exceptional service is part of its lifeblood and culture. Unfortunately this hotel is the former and not the latter--its really just a pretty face.   I judge the top tier hotels not by clean sheets and a soft pillow, (any 3 star can deliver that), but rather what they do to go above and beyond to provide a little extra if circumstances require it. My situation was simply  this: I showed up at the bar to get a meal after a long day at 9:31 and was told the kitchen closed at 9:30. So  I asked:  ""well its not that late could they make a small exception"". Nope. ""Order room service"" I was…",1

On arrival you are required to hand in your passports. There is a pool located inside the hotel but you have to wear a 'hat' really odd I thought -never heard of that before.Religious reasons?Needless to say we did not use the pool. There is a bar on the rooftop which we were not allowed to see as it was closed due to bad weather.Yet the whole time we were there it was sunny and hot-no wind. I think they just do not want to clean the area-so that was annoying as it can feel claustrophobic inside a room.Not very relaxing. The barman was very jovial -a lovely guy but I think they need more experience.All…,3

The room was so small we could not have moved around with 2 suitcases inside! We trawled back to reception to ask for another room . The lady was very helpful and allocated us a larger room.

The spa staff were very welcoming and provided excellent service.  The 60 minute “calming” massage and 60 minute foot massage were very good.  Their massage technique is excellent and the cool and hot Jacuzzis are very relaxing.  So top ratings for the spa.

All vending and ice machine were broken. Room air conditioning was not working enough to keep the room cool, had to open window to allow air to flow. Customer service lack from staff to management.

We had a lovely room with a wrought iron balcony overlooking the street, great for people watching. The hotel now provides coffee/tea and croissants each morning which is great.

This is the first time any hotel has ever done this to me in 10 years of corporate travel. Extremely disappointed with Parc 55.",1

It is within 10 minutes drive of downtown and Praia Dona Ana.  Our room was spacious with a lovely balcony and great shower.  We had dinner on our first night at the restaurant and the food was amazing, but expensive.   The issue was with the service.  Our waitress was cranky and nasty.  We asked a question about Cataplana, which we now know is a famous regional dish, but we were answered with annoyance and eye rolls. She could not be bothered with anything.

There are a few details that need work. Our room had no blankets for the sofa bed but a call to the office and they had some delivered. Parking needs some control. Plenty of it but in the wrong places most of the time. NOT at your villa. I had to park on the street overnight twice. Every room should have 1 reserved covered spot at the villa lot where your room in located if they are going to hand out unlimited parking passes.

For better or worse, I have logged hundreds of nights at hotels around the world, both for business and pleasure. I have come to appreciate (and expect) how hard hotels work to ensure that guests are welcomed and appreciated. My stay at the Anselmo did not live up to that basic expectation.

The reason for this becomes apparent after dark when the hotel bar becomes full of predominantly middle-aged business men and what is very obviously prostitutes.  By no means should this be overlooked but I'm sure this is an issue the Clift hotel is not alone in facing. On the surface this was initially just a creepy backdrop in the hotel bar and could be avoided by steering clear of the area at night, however this all changed when a pimp and prostitute tried their hand at room service, delivering a severe beating to a guest at 3:30am outside my door.

I did not experience any noise issues, my apartment was in the back and was very quiet.  This is not a luxury apartment but nicely furnished with a full use kitchen and washer/dryer combination.  On the down side, the bed was not comfortable and the shower is very small.  I'm average weight and height and it was cramped.  If you are more than average height/weight, you will probably have a problem fitting in the shower (if at all).",4

I also would only suggest that the staff at the reception behaves in a bit more warmer way, without that stereotypical German polite detachment, especially when a guest has to fill this appalling check-in form required by local bureaucrats. One more thing: free parking in the block around the hotel came as a nice surprise - it's something you don't expect to find in this district. ",4

Simple food that doesn't fit a 4 star hotel. It is just massive food with long lines and bad coffee. The hotel has a single restaurant that is very slow.

124,I recently was scheduled to fly 2500 miles to San Fransisco for a one day business meeting that got cancelled. The minute my meeting was canceled - I called and canceled the hotel room (48hrs in advance )and they provided me with a cancellation number #66961470. Furthermore they  said I was not going to be charged (that’s why I asked for the cancellation number). I got my American Express Statement and there was a charge of $683.06.  I was FURIOUS.  I called the hotel and left a message on 3 different occasions before some one (Sarah Gomez) finally called me back to tell me they had a 72HR cancellation policy. I made every effort to cancel when I found out my meeting was no longe taking place. what was I suppposed to do? Fly there for a meeting that wasn’t happening? Why give me…,1

Some may argue that it's the price of  Honolulu, but I disagree cuz I could easily book a hotel at the outrigger with 100/night.  its relatively new, I can see that its newly renovated, however, the AC is super loud, like I had to called the staff to come fix it, but he said its super old cannot be fixxed, I dig through some other comments up here before I booked it, some ppl also mentioned it, but I didn't believe their comments, but now I really do man, its super loud, I asked to change the room, and of course front desk denied my request.

Second tip: if you fail to follow first tip, run away from wasting money with club level rooms, room service and/or any additional service they may try to sell you. Final tip: bring your own portable air conditioning device: it gets really warm in rooms and around lobby, corridors etc etc. Old rooms, bad service!",2
132,"We were booked into this hotel by the tour company and after the last wonderful experience at the Radisson Blu hotel they had organized in Vilnius, perhaps my expectations were too high.  But I have previously stayed at their hotel in Beirut so not new to Radisson Blu.  I also wished I knew they status matched to Marriott/SPG as I would have asked them to match for my stay.  First off, do not be fooled by the lovely tower at the front.  If you are given a room in the north building immediately request a room in the other tower.  Rooms in the north building start with a ""6"".

But mostly I despise the tricky ""concierge"".  Upon check in, the reception suggested the concierge has useful information.  It was a 2 page large font printout of mostly general information.   Two clicks of Yelp and Google yielded more useful and in depth information.    The ploy was to sell time share and get you to attend their marketing sessions.  It was a time waster with the young man trying to strike up a conversation if why I was there, whom I was with, how much I love San Francisco, and a lengthy description of what San Francisco has to offer before the, oh would you like to get free…",1
134,The Hotel is well designed with a lot of attention to detail and creating space through innovative ideas. Furthermore we also experienced good service from the staff particularly from Mr.Xavier. The property is also centrally located.,4
135,"As an extremely frequent traveller I stay often at Sheraton, Marriott and Intercontinental properties. I generally avoid Intercontinental as of the three it is generally the worst value.  At this particular property - none of the following were included in the $145+tax price - breakfast, internet, gym. These are basic requirements and would have been free (at least for me based on elite status) at the other two chains. No happy hours either - they wanted $45 more for that. Staying here is like flying with Ryanair - you nearly have to pay to go to the loo.  Definitely not staying at Intercontinental ever again - unless its on a PointsBreak!",2
136,"The hotel was apparently started by the current owners in the last two years and it is very tastefully furnished and decorated, with elephants playing a major part in furnishings. Good lighting in the bathroom with dimmer switch too. Nice and quiet, well insulated and no noise from corridors despite having live music most nights. The bar and seating area is really comfortable and well thought out.   We were greeted warmly by the manager with a welcome drink while we were checked in. We had plenty of very helpful advice and recommendations  from Katie the concierge, which was much appreciated. The staff were generally good. The food was maybe a little expensive but was imaginative and of high quality. We went out for breakfast each day as pre-arranged and found many choices…",5
137,"Not sure if this hotel is trying to be a 5 star hotel or a discount airline as it is trying to follow both models. We were advised of a upgrade and VIP access on arrival which was great, although the VIP room is just 1 room with a coffee machine and some cold water/soft drinks. Lucky we had this though as the basic standards of every other hotel in the world do not seem to matter here. There is no coffee or tea in the rooms except for a pod machine with 2 pods that cost 1euro each to replace. No water after the first day either and even if you have your own coffee and tea there is no kettle. Then when you get back to your room there is the niggling question of whether they have actually cleaned the room that day. Even worse was when we asked for a bucket of ice and housekeeping…",3
138,This was the second time staying in the hotel.  I like the location (near KaDeWe) and subway stations.  I found the staff very helpful and concerned about making my stay as comfortable as possible.  Dinner at their restaurant was also good and reasonably priced.,5

141,"Fantastic stay at the Novotel Mitte. Brilliant location with easy access to attractions throughout the city. Class touch from staff for providing a small gift for the children upon check in. Breakfast was a little on the expensive side, but it was quick and easy for us. Also close to transport links to and from the airport. Rooms were clean and modern, and staff friendly. We would definitely stay here again.",4

We had a nice armoire for hanging clothes and putting things on shelves.  We had a desk and chair, a nice sized bed with two side tables and a great window to open for the outdoor air and an adequate bathroom.  The elevator, although small, was always available and fast.  The Metro is just across the street as is a grocery, Carrefour, to get provisions for your days out on the town.

144,It was difficult for me to rate the hotel but I have to be honest and explain to other travellers why I was so disappointed compared to the excellent reviews I read.   I booked the private room for two persons. When we arrived we noticed the picture on the website were not the same as the room. The room was extremely small ( the smallest private i have got in 6months of travelling around the world) it was impossible to put out two bags somewhere and unpack. So we just left the things in the bag.   To add insult to injury the room is next to the shared living room of the hostel where everyone just chills and there is the reception.

Around a midnight a Group of People  came to a sitting area at the courtyard and start having a party downthere, buying drinks from hotels bar. The courtyard had an great accustic, and every sound was raising up to our window(together with cigaretts smock). As there is no airconditioning in the rooms,and ventilation is poor, we  couldnot sleep With window closed, so as you see, we had an awfull night in a middle of the summer heat. My husband tried to talk to the stuff, but nothing had happened. Full dissappointment. Bed was uncomfortable,too... Winter blankets(!) some mosquitos as well.",2

Personal was polite and helpful and both the room and the bathroom were comfortable and clean. It should be noted that, at least on the 4 shared bedroom, one of the lockers is smaller than the rest - in all of them you need your own locker. Can't make opinion on the bar because I didn't use it's services",4

The location is perfect if you don’t mind using public transport. The RAI train station is about a kilometre away and M52 takes you directly to Amsterdam Centraal. You can also get buses for the Tulip Garden from RAI station.  In terms of the amenities, I was expecting the hotel to have basic things like moisturiser which most hotels have. When I asked about the same, I was told that it is a budget hotel so doesn’t provide moisturiser, which felt odd given that they had body wash. No kettle in the room. No provision to make your own tea/coffee. No glasses/cups for water either (unless you count the…",3
150,"First of all: the beds are superb. A good hotel room in my view should be quiet, dark and cool. All three requirements are met. The insulation against street noise is good. The shades and curtains do their work. And the airconditioning is so quiet I could leave it on during the night! One odd thing: during our stay a new television set was installed. The technician made use of the hotel room toilet and took a drink from the minibar. Embarrassing, isn't it?",4

The bathroom has a full size bathtub and even a laundry machine. It was perfectly clean when we arrived, and they even prepared the sofa bed for our kid. The location is perfect. We used the public transport the first day (there's a station 50m from the hotel), but then we rented bicycles and ended up touring the city on them, with access to bike paths and short distance of Tiergarten and other landmarks. There are 2 supermarkets nearby, and plenty of restaurants with a wide variety of offers. The staff is friendly and helpful, and the overall service was perfect.",5

I am of course fine with this since it's their policy, however at 3pm when we asked for our rooms, guess what: They were not ready!! We saw several people get rooms while we waited so it was pretty frustrating to not be able to get ours. After an early flight all you want to do is rest not wait and wait and wait! I am disappointed they couldn't rush the cleaning of our room or at least have them ready by 3!",1

I can honestly say that I have had better in a holiday inn.   There was no table service for tea/ coffee nor a menu to order other items.  The buffet was 53 euro for the two of us.   It was very poor quality, there was only the choice of scrambled egg which was stone cold, chicken sausage, streaky bacon, mushroom, tomato on the hot section. Oh and boiled egg.  There were a selection of cold items with toast or croissant.    Lovely hotel but the breakfast is a rip off.…",3

Anyway, onto the terrible service story: Morning of checkout, there was a $69 bill for breakfast at the hotel restaurant under my door. Someone had written my room number on their bill.

As to having a great location I am not so sure. It depends how you want to travel round the city. We wanted to walk and not everyone would be happy with a 45 minutes walk to the main old town centre, especially as it is slightly uphill coming back! Do not try walking to the Tower of Belém or the Monastry of St Jerome. We thought we could walk there along the sea front but the main docks got in the way.

The good points were that the staff were excellent and helpful, the room was clean and had all we needed and the location was good. The bad points were the bicycle hire they offer is a little steeply priced, but the main issue we thought was that no clean towels was given and our bin wasn’t emptied for the whole time that we stayed. With addition to this our bedding wasn’t changed once either. All in all, we would stay again as it’s good price but just these few things that we would want amended. ",3

183,"Stayed here for 3 nights and had a very enjoyable stay. Staff gave a warm welcome and were very polite & helpful. The hotel itself is lovely and looks quite fancy for a 'budget' hotel! Room was spotless and had nice decor.  Great location, just round the corner from an underground station so very easy to get to all the attractions from here.  I would recommend to others and already plan on staying here again when I go back to Berlin",5
184,I’ve been at the hotel for less than 1 hour and the experience has been terrible so far. I paid extra for a nice corner view room. I get to my room and it’s the clusterphobic interior room with no exterior view. I go back down to the front desk/bar and they said they ran out of the rooms I booked. I said I paid extra for a nicer room. He said all he could do is have his manager call me tomorrow and see if they can get me a different room tomorrow (I’m only staying 2 nights). I wish I had read reviews online prior to booking because the hotel website does not say there is no bathroom. It’s like a NYC apartment that’s 100 sqft with bedroom and bathroom in the same room. The tiny shower is literally 1 foot from the bed. The hotel website also does not detail that there is no…,1
185,"If you are the type of traveler whose ideal hotel room is modern, new and cozy, then you will love Fred Hotel.  Sara on the reception was so nice to us and helpful.  The Neighborhood is not noisy at all. There are plenty of shops and restaurants around.   We will definitely return back next time we are in Paris",5
186,"I am checking in right now and booked through hotel.com. My reservation somehow ended up in my husband’s name instead of mine. One would think, no big deal. We have the same last name and I had my license to prove who I was. I also had the confirmation email with number and it was my credit card that was charged. Nope, I was told they needed me to call hotels.com and have them confirm the reservation was for me.    So I call hotels.com and they change the reservation and called the hotel to let them know that I was the correct person for the reservation. One would think that would be enough. It wasn’t. Finally, after I waited for the hotels system to update, the front desk assistant decided all of the above was enough and checked me in.   Who knows what I’ll think of this hotel…",1
187,"In room Fridge. No. HBO. No. Location, ok. If you want to be close to BUMS. I was accosted on several occasions. Rooms? Not as large as the pics. The room was smaller than my office, the bathroom left a lot to be desired. I would NEVER stay here again. The SECOND you walked out the door, BUMS. The ONLY saving grace was the aproximity to the trolly and the staff (front desk), we had a do not disturb sign on the door and the maid walked in on us and knocked on the door every day. She actually saw me naked when she walked in. NOT A GOOD THING!!!!",1
188,Stayed for three nights. Good location with easy access to the city. Service was good and facility clean and tidy. Room with good space and hard good bed and easy walk-in shower. Only downsize to this visit was their breakfast offer which cost 30 euros per person which in my mind is not a good deal.  Therefore I can not give it a full house.,4
189,"Bringing the girlfriend back home from Arizona. We stopped in Anaheim for a day at Disneyland which was great. We stayed at the Hilton for $200 with parking. (King room)  Didn't make a reservation here, but stopped by to book a room. The gal at the front desk was very rude and unprofessional. I had looked online, and the going rate was about $116/night. She informed me that parking was $40/night, and the room rate would be $140. All together with taxes we would be looking at $207 for one night... At a holiday inn. Did I hear that right?  No thanks. I'm down the street at the hotel Whitcomb. No complaints about the room this far. Do not recommend that place to anyone.",1
190,"We chose the Best Western Eduardo VII due to its relative proximity to the airport and reasonable rate, as we were only staying for one night before picking up a rental car. For the duration of our short stay, we did not have any complaints, however there was nothing memorable about this hotel. Front desk staff was pleasant  upon check in. We did not have breakfast but rather grabbed a pastry from a nearby shop the following morning. As we wanted to take a short  walk before heading back to the airport, we asked if they could store our luggage for a few hours, which they graciously did. There is a beautiful park nearby, worth visiting.  Location appears to be convenient for public transportation. Would I choose this hotel property again for one night? Probably. For a week's…",3
191,"I had a wonderful stay at Cosmo Hotel. The room I had was very small, but modern and very nicely appointed. The rates are very reasonable for what you get, which is a comfortable spot in what I would say is a nice budget design hotel in the heart of the city. Beds were lovely and very comfortable (I kept sleeping in!).   The location in Mitte is excellent and was a perfect base for exploring the city for the my first visit to Berlin. I rented a bike from the hotel on two of the days there and it was so convenient for seeing all of the places I wanted to go. Above all, it was the service and helpfulness of the staff that really made my visit extremely wonderful. Everyone was very accomodating and happy to help with any questions that I had.",5
192,Surely not what you expect from Leela hospitality. Visited the hotel and first they showed us some problem with the pax booked. Wrongly booked 1 person instead of two. We still agreed to pay for the other at the rate specified. They tell us that we r upgraded for a complimentary buffet breakfast for 2 without updating in their system. Next day they charge us for the breakfast. On questioning the over sweet manager says nothing of that sort was said to us and max he can do is probably not charge us the next time we go with them as if we will go after such an insulting experience. Man we know you guys are good but atleast mantain that dignity. When person who is staying in Leela can afford a stay can surely pay for ur breakfast also..  ,2
193,"Do not stay at this hotel, nor park at the garage that they recommend next door at a reduced rate. We stayed here 7/10-7/14. Over 15 vehicles were vandalized and damaged Saturday night of our stay. Mostly all were staying at this hotel. My new 2019 Dodge Ram had both the drivers side and passenger side windows busted. When reported, we were told to file with the garage and a police report was already filed. When asked if the hotel would make things right, we were told that they would remove the parking fee but absolutely nothing else. They showed zero compassion or care for the situation. They were however kind enough to allow people to use a vacuum to clean out their vehicles of broken glass lol I have always used Marriott bonvoy as our hotel choice, this has put an end to that…",1
194,"Because of my business related stay, this hotel was selected due to its proximity to where I was going to be working.   One of the first things that struck me a bit odd, was that for my stay the room price ranged from €80 to €300 a night. Further to that, rather than deducting the cost of the stay at the end of it, it had to be paid in advance (which I wasn’t aware off). Neither was it mentioned during my check in either. Wasn’t really expecting that, especially as one of my colleagues didn’t have to follow that same process  But, having said that, despite the cost, the stay was very pleasant. The staff were great, very friendly, informative and helpful.  The room I had was very spacious and comfortable. One of the things that was a let-down for me, was the inability to connect…",4
195,"I stayed here in a 6 bed shared room with two friends. Rooms were a decent size, clean and with a good ensuite bathroom. Wifi worked well and location was good with a metro station right outside so it was easy to get to the center, also near a few restaurants and bars.",4
196,"Staff at the hotel were extremely pleasant and helpful, restaurant was lovely for food, drinks and nice to chill out throughout the day.   Issues with a humming noise at night when trying to sleep which was annoying when actually trying to sleep. Room lighting is a little poor expecially when trying to get ready to go out in the evening and you can hear every noise from the hallway.   Hotel is nice but just wasn’t a hotel for me. ",3
197,"I stayed at the Viceroy Chicago and spent 3 nights. My sister and I shared a double queen room. There were many guests in our group staying as several rooms were blocked off for the wedding party and many of the bride and grooms guests. The hotel was pricey, the food was terrible, and the management never did call me back to discuss the details. I left two messages and well I Shoukd not be surprised that they were not interested in hearing about how they could improve their service. The rooms are small! The showers in the rooms were difficult to figure out, and once we got the darn thing to turn on the water would spray all over the floors! The glass barriers have an opening to large in between the tub and glass barrier to keep the water from spraying out. It’s fine just messy…",1

Funchal can be reached by free shuttle service or by public bus (2 Euro). Also, easy access to public swimming places (very clear Atlantic).  The interior is outdated and worn, e.g. the lifts, but particularly the rooms and the beds. The carpet in our room was next to disgusting. Room service was good, but compared to other hotels not special (e.g. they stopped giving little amenities like a small chocolate bar).  The pool is large and nice though temperature is rather cold. The pool chairs are of poor quality and worn, some pool towels had wholes.   Breakfast buffet was nice with a good choice of egg dishes,…",3
200,"This hotel met all the usual expectations of big hotels: Clean big rooms, very comfy beds, excellent bathroom.  Good enough overall, though it was liberally sprinkled with the fake smiles and cold service .... but these were done when expected and appropriately, so it was ok.   Our one main gripe for this place was it had the worse wifi login system we’ve come across. One had to key in a 6-number log-on and a 6-number password for each telco device (can’t use the same one if you had a mobile phone and a laptop) and you had to log in each and everytime you used the device (ie if your screensaver came on), you’ve have to login again. It sounds minor, but if you had to do it more than 10-times in a day, it becomes extremely tedious.   3/5",3

Room is fine - reasonably clean but a few matters that could be addressed. Hotel is huge and not offering adequate facilities for the size - eg pool tiny, breakfast a scramble as not enough tables.  Service at breakfast terrible, staff had no interest in finding you a table or clearing up. Also the absolute worst coffee I've had in Vietnam - first time I've had to leave the hotel to get proper breakfast and coffee. Also not a family atmosphere.

And if you want to stay here, you so need to the curtain open the room is too dark. I then asked the front desk again for a second change coz I was staying there for 9 nights.

The East Side Gallery of the Berlin Wall is walking distance from the hotel, and the metro is also very easy to use to get everywhere else.  The staff were the main highlight of the hotel and they couldn’t have been any more helpful and kind! Maciej Wilk was so accommodating and we are so thankful for the wonderful customer service!

Arrived after a long plane trip from Australia, friendly workers greeted us and took our bags straight to our room while we got checked in which was very easy.   Once getting into the room, it was very easy to settle in but our room did not have the best view, instead we looked a a wall of an office next door.   The pool is absolutely incredible - indoor. Beautiful lion head work at the pool which was about 15 meters long (guess). There was also a shower and amenities like free water and fruit.

Had to struggle through the curtain to put the key in to put the power on (why can't this be in a more accessible place?) and the security of just a sliding door to get into the room is a little odd.  It's advertised as a 5* hotel,I'm sorry,it's more like 3*!  The spa is nice,a little overpriced,but I guess it'll never be cheap? The bathrooms are small and the door just about opens,the freezer in the fridge is open to the elements,so doesn't freeze anything. The ""double"" bed is to singles pushed together.  I had to ring reception on my first night and I was surprised to not get an answer…",3
213,The hotel was situated overlooking the sea and the Cyclades of Santorini. The view of the sunset was amazing.  That's were the Honeymoon ends. There was a class system within this small hotel and those with the most money got the best sun beds etc.  The class system was played out in front of our faces. Despite having paid more than 3.5 k it was evident that some better off folk got special treatment. We had a night flight on our return and we were told we would have to pay 150€ extra for an even more basic room. We met a couple who paid significantly more for a honeymoon suite and they too were on a night flight. Whilst waiting for their return flight they left their belongings by the sun beds they were using to go and have a meal. On their return their belongings were moved…,3

During check in, I asked if they had a room that was on a higher floor, away from the elevator.

As I found my way to my room, not only did I discover that the room was in fact next to the elevator, it had 2 double beds instead of the 1 king bed my reservation was for.

In other words they do not trust their guests...and haven't they thought that they already have people's credit card numbers anyway. Love them to explain their logic.  2. They were so keen to push some sort of jewelry tour by a compnay called H Stern, even tried to delay us going out the next morning and putting their leaflet packs in our room!  3. No local maps on  display and a RELUCTANCE to hand over more than one decent map to our group of nine, so we felt compelled to approach them at differnt times. …",2

There is a metro stop (Vaugirard) 5 minutes away by walking. The breakfast that was provided by the hotel was plenty to get you started on your day.   There are a few quirks about the hotel room, as the bathroom was located in a room away from the shower/sink. We didn't have much a view, with our room facing a wall. We were happy with the working air conditioning, free breakfast, and views of the Eiffel Tower every time we stepped outside.",5

The entrance and lobby were extremely nicely designed, v.modern industrial feel, and the staff were really friendly. We also went to the adjoining restaurant which was good, and felt separate to the hotel enough to not feel like a hotel restaurant.   We got upgraded to a superior room, which was spacious and had the feel of a small apartment, with floor-to-ceiling windows, and a sliding mirror to separate the bathroom.  The design of the room was nice, with a picture rail with postcards and screen-prints, and a massive tv. Would have maybe liked a small armchair, instead of desk which I didn't really use.

The Sagrada Familia is on the doorstep practically and the nearest metro station is a 5 minute stroll. If you need a supermarket head to consum on the same street, it's a large supermarket for a city location and very well priced.   The apartment was well appointed, clean and nicely decorated. The bed was comfortable, although the sofa bed would benefit from a thicker mattress. The bathrooms were good too with excellent shower pressure. Everything you need here for a short stay.  Reception were very helpful and made some restaurant reservations for our party and recommended lots of places to visit while we were there. I will definitely return here.",4

222,Travelled with a group of people with disabilities. There was no hot water in one of the accessible rooms. At night there was no answer from the front desk so no help available. We were promised at 7am that the room would be changed. When we came back later in the day we were informed that all the accessible rooms had been rented out and there was no room for us. And then they called maintenance to fix the problem. The key cards kept needing to be changed because they didn't work. Good shopping mall next door and grocery store across the road.,2
223,"I would expect the room to be equipped with AC and the breakfast to be richer at the rates we were charged. Also, the persons in charge of the reception should be more professional like as they didnt turn to see who was coming in at 11 pm or later through the side door.  ",3

How can you charge guests who didn't even check-in for two full nights? Plus, they completely lied about everything - there's no actual parking, nor will your car or belongings be safe, the hotel is in a disgusting alleyway, and from what I've read from other guests who sadly had to stay here, the rooms are dirty and the included breakfast is mini boxes of cereal. There were stained mattresses laying outside in their ""parking lot"" taking up space…",1

Second the hotel building is so big but also so empty that you feel like you entered to a museum .

Please do not stay at this Four Seasons assuming the typically world-best standard that you would expect from Four Seasons.  This is more like your typical Hilton - from the room layout and decor to the quality of the restaurants.  Services standard is low - terrible, actually - but, that you would expect from most hotels in China still (except a small handful).

Due to the strike there was cleaning service, you needed to wait in a line at the front desk for additional toiletries, there was very little staff and of course the noise of all the strikers.   The entire situation was handled very poorly.  There was absolutely no communication with guests and no apology to guests for the inconvenience.   The staff was not very friendly or helpful.  I would never stay at this hotel again and would be hesitant to stay at a Marriott/SPG again considering they don't treat their employees or guests very well.  ",1

For my boyfriend and I we are now 100% sure that we are looking for the something else.

The hotel is large, stunning location with a long private beach. The grounds were clean. It really looks very impressive and nicely decorated.

It’s 6am and she’s just put music on to drown the splashes out.   In a few minutes I will move into the shower area which, for added privacy, includes see through glass into the bedroom.  Sadly the see through area of the glass covers my coin purse area so she won’t be able to see me wash my nuts on this occasion.

For the price charged to stay at a five star hotel in the heart of downtown, the service REALLY sucks. How do you run out of eggs and coffee at 8:45 am? How is a room not serviced by housekeeping by 3:30 pm in the afternoon?  The hotel is nice I guess, but any joy I had from the rooms and layout of the hotel was marred by extremely poor service, indifferent hotel leadership, and a “we don’t really care” attitude from all of the Marriott associated I encountered.

Another unpleasant thing is that stuff is quite rude, they do not want to help at all. There were a lot of negative emotions, only because Iasked reception desk to translate to English the chinese address!  when I asked the bellboy to help with taxi, he said it is not my buisness.

In-room phone broken and TV reception was poor. It wasn’t until next morning the TV menu worked. Too many other options in Chicago. Don’t plan on making this hotel an option next visit ",1
238,"I've given this 3 stars, although for value it could have been 4, with the low score being more to do with things the hotel could do nothing about - the location - this hotel is isolated and although there is a positive aspect to being right next to the sea, with marvellous views and sunsets, the noise of the sea at night time kept me awake. It wasn't a soothing, waves gently breaking type of sound, but a deep roar followed by the crashing of the waves on the cobbled beach. This may have been a seasonal aspect, as it was for only 3-4 nights of our stay and may not be the same at different times of the year. Other aspects of the hotel were generally good.

There is no onsite evening restaurant here apart from snacks offered in the bar.  The restaurants in the area are few, we looked at Bret pub directly across from the hotel. A good menu but doesn’t cater for children. We tried grand cafe Hermès which has a nice European menu. Kids choice is half portions of adult menu which is good as my 9 year old likes these dishes.  Starbucks is open for breakfast.   The Hotel itself is a very economical way of seeing…",3
240,"The elevators were broken when I was there. It took 30 minutes to wait for an elevator to come get us. It was so bad we walked down from the 20th floor with our suitcases because we could not wait for the elevator.   The staff was unapologetic about it. We then called after our stay to complain about the ridiculousness of the situation, asking for some sort of compensation and was told ""too bad, it is what it is""",1
241,"This hotel does NOT have a shuttle service.  They direct you to the same shuttle service 90% of tourists use to get to Waikiki.  It will cost you about $30 from the airport.    Room doors have a huge gap at the bottom. Room was very dated with tacky tile, rusty metal panels in the bathroom, and very dates fixtures in the bathroom.  It felt like an older Motel in fact.  ""Breakfast"" may as well have been from a vending machine.     Room was very humid and required A/C all night, but there were not adequate blankets to stay warm while asleep.",2
242,"First off, I´d like to point out that my low rating has nothing to do with the excellent Staff that host this Hotel. The Staff made sure my stay was amazing, yet the hotel administration could make some important changes.   The location of the hotel is really amazing, it is in the best district of the city, and walking distance to some of the major stores, retailers and hotels. The Recoleta area is really increadible.   Regarding the Brick hotel. The lobby has evidently undergone some serious and very tasteful modernization. Yet, the rooms urgently need some attention. The hallways smell like they could use some deep cleaning. The rooms were my biggest disappointment. The bathroom always smelled like it needed some fresh air, as it would smell of sewage after taking a shower.…",2
243,"The problem started right from the beginning at check in.  As I was on business, I required a red official invoice from the hotel to submit to my company's finance division.  The receptionist told me the hotel were not able to issue it when I checked out the following day.  As I was checking out around 8:00 a.m., before the accountant department started work, I asked if it would help if I return to the hotel a few hours later to collect the red invoice.  Again, she said no, and that the hotel would post the red invoice to my office later on.    When I asked why, all she could fall back on was that this was the hotel's policy and was already mentioned in the e-mail correspondence.  It was extremely frustrating for me talking to someone who kept trying to stonewall!    I requested…",2
244,"I gave this hotel 3 stars for their great food, fabulous location and friendly staff however for a 5 star hotel it's not all that.   We arrived early and no rooms were available for us -even though we only needed one room- so they suggested that we'd take a walk or have breakfast at the hotel we stayed for almost 5 hours post arrival to get our room even though while waiting we heard and saw a group arriving after us whom got their rooms right away. Once we got our room we were surprised for how uncomfortable the beds were, the shower was leaking, and how  it hasn't been renovated in long time. On the last day while checking out was surprised that they actually added the 1st day breakfast charge to the room even though I have booked my room with breakfast & when argued I was…",3
245,"We arrived at the cliff bay on 25 April 2016 expecting perfection and it should have been. It is a beautiful, luxurious and well kept building and we could not understand why we felt this way.  We were sited in a junior suite on the third floor, which was well kept by our friendly room maid, so no problem there. In fact, the whole building and the gardens are superb. After a couple of days, we decided that our problem was caused by the fact that all front of house staff were Portuguese and needed to understand european languages better.  In addition, we didnt like the food at either main restaurant.  To compensate, we ate in the little restaurant next door.  We went there on five nights and saw about 20 couples from the cliff bay and some of them were regulars as well.",3
246,"I’ve been staying in this hotel very recently and I have to admit that after reading all the enthusiastic reviews I am truly disappointed. I can confirm that the staff is nice and friendly but the rooms as such scream for a refreshment. The blinds in my room were dirty and there was fungus in bathroom, the toilet seat was loose, etc. I could come with many more details but I think that this should be enough. All the details where I looked at were telling me that this hotel was probably a 5* venue many years ago but now all you can see are the shadows of passed glory.  This hotel lacks proper maintenance and there is no attention paid to the details. Something what I would expect that would be self explanatory in a 5* hotel.  Location isn’t to be honest that great either. It is…",2
247,"A lot of people have criticised this hotel, and some reviews are more accurate than others. In my opinion, having just returned from two weeks here... I would say that it is 'basic' which is what you would expect from a three star hotel. The rooms need updating but hey are clean and the soft furnishings including towels all need replacing. The decor is tired and the feel of the hotel is just tired and old. However, as long as you go with an open mind, and decide that you got a cheap holiday so you must enjoy it, you will be fine. I loved the food, plenty of choice and loads of fresh fruit and vegetables which is perfect for me and I lost half a stone so very happy. The hotel is up a steep hill, but it's Maderia so it's going to be steep everywhere. To be honest I don't think I…",3
248,A good hotel for the location and metro/buses/trams nearby and regular. Check out the rooms before you book as ours turned out to be a disappointment as it was without a window and was very small. No place to hang jackets or store suitcases etc. The ensuite needed complete renovation. mixer handle falling off on your feet in the shower. Shower door jamming all the time. cold/hot water not mixing properly and chances of scolding. Breakfast choice could be improved. Reception staff were all excellent and gave us all the information we needed. Special thanks to Ricardo who gave us information for our visit to Sintra. Thanks Ricardo Jess,3
249,"Stayed for a night recently for a business trip. A great central location - although expect a €40 Uber from Schönefeld airport. You're right in one of the main tourist areas in about a 2 minute walk, which is either good or bad, depending on your view, ;-) I'd say it's a good thing - plenty of sights to see nearby, and an easy 20 min walk or so down to the river to sit at some tables in the sun in the evening.  Room on 6th floor was large and well fitted out, all very new. Plenty of amenities in the room, e.g. toothbrushes, if you need them. Breakfast was also pretty good - enjoyed the selection of cheeses they had on offer, which actually had some flavour.  I checked in late, but didn't feel particularly welcomed, which is one reason I give them 4, not 5. Relatively minor point…",4
250,This hotel is a wee bit expensive but was absolutely worth it. Terrific rooms - Ideally positioned and the service was second to none. Great sleep and fantastic breakfast. The journey to & from Paris attractions was very easy via the Metro stations nearby.,5
251,"My stay at Le Village Hostel was an awesome experience, i didnt expect the rooms to be so nice or the beds so comfy, but they were. Stayed on the first floor overlooking the street and the patio. The reception desk personnel, claire, micheal, voorman and kat were on point with their service. They all spoke english very well which was great cause my french sucked.  They were extremely helpful in getting me around to different locals around paris. I would definitely recommend this place to stay in. Be sure to book in advance cause they do fill up. Wen u go, tell them RJ sent u, my logo is on the cooler next to their desk.",5
252,"Everything I wanted in a hostel as a 27 year-old seasoned traveler. Near great food (French, Tunisian, east Asian, AMAZING bakeries like Le Roi Des Saveurs). It's along 2 metro lines. The bar is great, the roof is great. Seriously. Highly recommended.",5
253,"This hotel is amazing for 3 reasons: Firstly, the staff are so welcoming and helpful - we arrived before check-in time and were greeted with a drink from the bar and our room ready for us.  the staff was so nice.  Secondly the generous size of rooms and hotel in general was excellent.  Our suite was the best we have stayed in. Thirdly the location is in the artistic district and full of interest and restaurant choices.  The location is out of the city centre but that is reflected in the price of the rooms, which would be far higher, for such quality, if centrally located. The food menu is a bit complex and a few simpler dishes would be welcome, but overall I have to say this is a first class venue, which I highly recommend.  Nothing is too much trouble for the staff (Nadia & Ben…",5
254,"The staff has all been very friendly with the exception of a front desk receptionist. The room, bedding, even our clothes feel damp the entire stay. The wifi is extremely slow, if working at all. My own cellular service barely has reception until I am out of the building. The food is mediocre. It is spring break. That being said, we have to have wristbands for pool area which can not be enjoyed due to the chaos and loud music that continues to vibrate our room windows up until 11ish at night. ",1
255,"Comfortable hotel, served its purpose. Right next door to train station. Rooms small but satisfactory for a couple of nights stay. Paid a decent price and would probably compare it to some well known English hotels, but slightly higher standard. Customer service were helpful and the breakfasts were very tasty. Would recommend.

259,"We had a great stay in Berlin. i31 was new to us. Very good room and service. Room en bathroom clean. Possibility to open window to little balcony. We had a room with a look at the garden. We would certainly book again at this hotel for our nest stay in Berlin. Tip for the hotel: what if there is no room for the car to park? I couldn't find information on your site about other parking places. We paid 15eur per say to park. On our last day the airconditioning seemed to have problem cooling the room.  Tip for visitors, rent a bike at the desk. And cycle to Prenzlauer Berg for instance",4
260,"I'd like to start by talking about the good things with this hotel.  Firstly the location is excellent, at the quieter end of the beach we found the hotel peaceful and ideally situated to get to all the bars and restaurants.  I'd also like to give a hearty congratulations to the staff who were helpful where possible, always friendly and a pleasure to meet.  The room we were in was clean and well appointed, you wouldn't use the word ""spectacular"" but then that's not what I paid for.  We had the chance to try a massage which was fantastic, the lady who gave me a rub down worked damn hard for her euros!  I also had a steam in the steamroom and used the plunge pool to get the old heart beating!  Now for the main criticism and what stops this hotel getting 4/5.  The food was…",3
261,"The hotel is all in all comfortable, clean and with a nice cozy atmosphere. Friendly helpful staff and nice breakfast, I agree with the other reviews. Only (very) negative note is for me the super crazy noise at night: we stayed in room 109 and had to survive loud hip-hop music flooding in through the walls from I guess a neighbouring bar. The reception said ""it's normal, being Palermo at weekend"" (it was so on Thursday and Friday night, don't know about the other nights). I have one more night booked at this hotel in a few weeks, can only hope in a better room.",2

My room was not cleaned for four days, I had to take out my own trash.   No fresh towels, and when I ran out of coffee cups (what good is a coffee maker with no coffee and no cups??) I had to buy my own.  The absolute WORST was having to buy my own toiled paper, and the fruit flies that took up residence in the room.     And it's not like you got a nice letter from the management slipped under your door notifying you or anything, and then having to cross picket lines to get in and out of the hotel?   Oh yeah, and the unbearable NOISE of strike horns blowing all night long!  I called the front desk for…",1

264,"The place is clean, quiet and has a great location.  The only misgiving I have is that we thought the breakfast buffet was included in the price.  We checked out and then found out that the breakfast was 7.50 Euros per person. The buffet was still worth it, but I wish we had been informed beforehand.",4
265,"A good clean hotel, located next to Glories Mall which offers sufficient shops and restaurants. Tram and bus stops very close by. Free and effective wifi. Room size is average, modern and bright and clean and comfortable. Bed and linen comfortable, aircon was effective. Bathroom was reasonably -appointed,  water was hot & shower pressure acceptable. Staff service was efficient but on occasion a little dour. The hotel restaurant was quite good. Hotel in general is well-maintained and well-designed. There is no hotel drop-off point, so taxis have to alight on the other side of the road (not a very busy one), and luggage has to cross the road as well.",4
266,"Stunning hotel, with almost everything you need except a kettle and tea bags!! Breakfast was not included and was rather expensive so we did not add it on.  Perfect location. Beautiful room and bathroom.  Lovely staff.  Shame the bar on the top floor was closed as weather was lovely despite it being January.  Almost perfect and would definitely recommend for a city break. Must note we booked as a last minute deal so very good price, however unsure as to price normally. ",4
267,"Construction started at 08:00 in the morning and is still going 3 hours later. Continuous banging and drilling with no end. There is not a single form of cooling or air coming through the room, therefore the room is now 77 degrees. Other guests loudly shouting and singing at 10 in the morning which can be heard by everyone because having an open window is the only way to get some air circulation in the room. Extremely unpleasant and do not recommend anyone to stay here.",1

Upon getting to my room I found the bedding to be filthy, and TV not working. I put my shoes back on and went down stairs and asked the manager to either fix the problem, change my room, or simply refund me. After he dismissed me for 20min, he ran away from the front desk. I returned to my room and assumed I'd find him there, he wasn't. So I headed back down to the front desk, where he again wasn't. I returned back to my room to see maybe if he was there? Turns out someone was, but they had entered my room and double locked it using the privacy throw that opens the door a crack. I knocked on the door and shouted for…",1

Yes it was old fashioned and if I wasn't there for a hen do I would have preferred somewhere A bit more stylish. Staff were nice, friendly, helpful and chatty. They laid down the law as soon as we arrived in a relatively firm tone which some of our party didn't appreciate but I was quite refreshed at the straight forward-ness of them!  We didn't have breakfast or any drinks there so can't really comment on those. ",3

On the second day they said do you want to stay in the original room you booked or continue to stay in this honeymoon suite.  The original room wasn't bad, but who wants to move during their honeymoon at 11am...repack, get situated in a new room etc.  We opted to stay in the honeymoon suite but asked for some sort of deal or price reduction (the price to stay was 150 euro additional per night).…",3

273,Working but looking forward to 5 star hotel treatment.  Premium price ( discounted slightly through client).  Was disappointed by slightly tired rooms. Bar area stuck in Foyer with no atmosphere. Food and Wine was overpriced and average. Will be staying elsewhere on next visit. My colleague paid more for a terrible & noisy room.,2
274,"I stayed 6 nights in this very clean, well maintained hotel. My room was small but had everything a solo traveller could ask for. But if you’re expecting alcoholic drinks at the bar (business people) - they don’t have a license (WT?) very odd. Great access to tram immediately outside the door. A couple of snippy male reception staff - could use a lesson in ‘pleasant manner 101’! If you’re a fussy pillow person - maybe ask for their ‘best’ pillows as my pillows were nothing more than pieces of sponge rubber inside a pillow case !",3

The hotel was fine and did the job, clean (ish), the staff were very friendly and helpful, location ok as was very close to 2 underground stations. You get what you pay for, our trip was £120pp including flights and hotel for 2 nights so we were very happy with this hotel for that price. ",4
278,"This hotel offers solid value for Berlin travelers and especially to anyone interested in exploring Schoeneberg and the surrounding vicinity. The neighborhood is known to be Berlin's premier gay hotspot and naturally the area is very gay friendly and hospitable to the full diversity of travellers. I found the hotel to be well maintained, warm and cozy with a decent breakfast buffet and excellent reception service. It's certainly not a ritzy resort and not super newly renovated but my room offered more than a comfortable night's stay and was well equipped, clean and very pleasant to stay in.  Special thanks to Marian at the reception for her friendly and professional front desk service! ",4

Only a few minutes walk to La Rambla, La Boqueria etc.",4

Although we had a general itinerary for the duration that we were there, we thought the front desk would be able to assist us in quick/easy directions with taking transit and any tips that I am very sure they are aware of. Rather, they were very insistent on selling us the HopOn HopOff tour. It is a good deal if you're into that type of vacation. We wanted to explore on our own and instead of getting simple answers, we would get the run around. Example- Q: How much does the bus cost?

The only initial disappointment was that when we first checked in they gave us a 1 bedroom room, with an incredible outdoor patio space complete with lounge chairs and all, then called shortly after to let us know they had made a mistake given we had actually booked a 2 bedroom room.

Then we go to the fact that our paper towels were turned brown and tan from the amount of dirt and food picked up.

We selected the dishes also.  As other family members were taking time to reach we started exploring cafe nosh and Delhi 32.  To our surprise Delhi 32 was offering set menu for 1200+taxes for unlimited food. 2 starters, 2 main dishes accompanied by dal raita roties and pulao, topped with desert.    We were four of us.  We asked for 4 people how many starters? To our surprise he said set menu is per table minimum of 2 people.  We said fine then serve us 4 starters for 4 people.  Which the manager refused, coming to us after many reminders.  He said it’s per table which can be from 2 to 8 people and…",2

The only advantage is the location, but also the Panamericano is not very far so I will spend the next time there. In summary: the windows that should open up to vasistas are destroyed, sometimes they open up supported by a single point of support that considering the weight is dangerous. Noisy: the front streets are noisy for traffic and the back too, due to the rumble of a swimming pool that raises at the 5th floor of a dilapidated building. This time I stayed 10 nights and the bed sheets were never changed. The shower passes from icy to boiling water. This I found only on the eleventh floor. Breakfast is average: bad coffee…",2

How else do you deal with a situation where the front office demands payment for the room even though your corporate travel agent has already given them the payment many hours before!! You would obviously feel that either you have been scammed or something is horribly wrong with the staff of the hotel. Their front office staff had the bloody temerity to keep claiming for forty minutes on the phone with my corporate travel agent that no payment has been made and they would not allow any checkin!

The service agent at the desk was nice he said I needed to speak with Luis and he put me through to his voicemail. When I did not receive a return phone call from Luis I tried his office again three days later during normal business hours. This was April 9th. When I had not received a call back from his again after two days time I wrote into IHG customer service in respects to the lack of service asking them to have some one contact me back. I received an email on April 11th stating some one from the location would contact me within 48 hours. I went on a business trip from Saturday through Yesterday. No call or email was sent to me. So today now six days after…,1

The breakfast each morning is amazing and a wonderful time to chat to Sabine and the other guests. Each day the food varied and we got to try all sorts of seasonal, local food from sausage to fish to pate to delicious pastries and breads, jam made by her friend from her own back yard, yoghurt, fresh fruit and of course wonderful coffee. Sabine gave us suggestions each day on where to go - places we would not have gone to otherwise. This was the best bed and breakfast we stayed in on our trip and we would definitely stay here again.",5

So they give us this scam explanation of this voucher dine around thing you can buy where you pay 500,000 dong and get 750,000 in voucher in return. So we did that.  Then, upon discovering how even more outrageously priced everything is, we decided we might as well upgrade to “all inclusive” for the full day we are here.   Their “All Inclusive” is a HUGE SCAM!!!! Good god, you pay $70 (CAD, $55 US)to be all inclusive in only their garbage buffet (literally the worst resort buffet food I have ever had) and the Snack Bar.

The hostel is clean , the bathroom is always clean . The hostel provides a lot of things such as visit in the city, dinner in the hostel ecc ecc. If you want a good hostel without paying a lot of money ,  you need to go to Para Teatro",4

We had booked a basic double room, the view was OK, the room was clean and it had all the small extras that you expect from a 4 star hotel, the beds were a little small though, and pushed together to make a double bed, which of course means its not a double bed (per say). The breakfast was a disaster. We actually did not eat the breakfast on the second morning of our stay because it was so horrible. There was not much to choose from. It consisted of watery vegetables with no taste, egg omlet that was also watery and had no taste, the juice had run…",2

Hotel is about five minutes from the Metro and across the street from the Congress Place. There are several restaurants to choose from in that area. Getting around to the monuments and museums were very easy....usually one to two stops on the Metro. If you would like to walk to Arc de Triumph you could, it is about a 15 to 20 minute walk. Staff was very nice. Stephon and Lena were exceptional. Keep in mind that this is an AC hotel so there is not a restaurant on the premises. There is a breakfast buffet for around 22 euros. If you are a gym fanatic, do not book this hotel. The gym was two treadmills and some free weights.…",5

Offered other much more expensive alternatives.  Settled for a mojito. Asked twice, no ice. Came with ice. Price on cocktail menu was 500 roubles. Companion had same.  Bill came to over 1600 roubles when GST, tax and service and other charge added! Not disclosed on menu. Extra 50% in all! Also several other issues,  but suggest avoid the bar.",2
332,"The hotel is well located in Buenos Aires downtown. Very close to Florida street. Suits are small, there is no way to control the air conditioning (general system) so sometimes its very hot and others cold. We had a lick in our shower. On the top of all wifi was really bad. When you travel it is essential to be connected. The hotel only offers free wifi at the lobby and it is very very slow!!!! If you want to use it at the bedroom you need to pay it (which I consider not a smart business decision. Makes clients very unhappy). Even paying for it, it continued really slow!!! Service is ok. Breakfast, ok. ",2

There are plenty of opportunities for eating, drinking, strolling, shopping, and exploring Berlin's history around the hotel.

The three-course dinner was not worth the price at all, and the staff at the restaurant were hurried an unprofessional. The breakfast was great though!",4

Very polite and well spoken. Breakfast was ok but could be better. Also a little advice, please fix the cracked glass at the main door because it the first thing customers see and it doesnt do the hotel any justice on first impression. Thanks for the quality service",5
337,"If you are looking for a good central boutique hotel with modern rooms and facilities this is one. But, make sure you ask for a room at the backyard (preferably top floors) because the train passes right in front of it. Do not book on lower floors looking at rails of the track because you will be disturbed by the noise. Unless, you sleep with earplugs and that doesn't bother you at all. The rooms are reasonably sized, they have wifi, TV with international channels, modern look and feel and you can manage the temperature of your room. Ideal for a short stay.",4

Every staff member we encountered at the Intercontinental was unbelievably friendly and gracious despite our complete lack of knowledge of the German language. The rooms are small but typical European setup. 2 twin beds which worked out great for us as I was traveling with a work colleague. The shower/ tub was beautiful but a bit scary/slippery and difficult to get in and out of due to the very high sides and lack of safety rails. Without a doubt, they have the BEST bath sheets of any hotel EVER. The towels are plush, soft and HUGE! The breakfast buffet is very good and offers a wide variety of offerings.",4

The stairs going down to the bathroom are really dangerous; you could easily fall down them when entering the room if you’re not careful; there’s no railing, and they’re deep. The floors are slippery and some doors don’t open all the way. It was also annoying having to go down those stairs just for the shower and your stuff. The AC is okay.

By 11 pm, our AC was still not fixed, although they told us we should wait longer to see if it might start working. They finally offered for us to switch rooms (not an upgraded room, even though we should have gotten one).

We arrived at the hotel by taxi from the airport, the doormen didn’t come to assist with luggage and instead just carried on chatting in the doorway. Headed to reception on the 6th floor.

348,"We have stayed at, and enjoyed, the Outside Inn a number of times over the years.   No more.  We were planning a trip to Nevada City to see the fall colors, and looked at the Outside Inn web site to see what availability they had. I noticed that the web site had changed, and there were new T's and C's that hadn't been there before. Perhaps they have new owners, but I don't know for sure.  Here's what I found out when I read their new policy:  First, you had to pay for your entire stay when you booked. Second, you had to cancel within 72 hours of your arrival. If you canceled outside 72 hours, you'll be charged 10% of your deposit, including fees and taxes.   But if you canceled inside 72 hours (10 days on Christmas and Thanksgiving), they kept the ENTIRE FEE! Graciously, they suggested that you get travel insurance if you objected to losing all your money. How magnanimous of them.  So to get a reservation, you had to either be prepared to lose the whole amount they'd charge you for your stay, or tack on the cost of travel insurance to your booking fee.  Are you kidding me?  We couldn't believe their new policy was real, so I emailed them asking if I had read it correctly. As they never replied, I can only assume that it is as I stated above.  For that reason, we're never going back to them, at least as long as this policy is in effect.  One time, probably ten years ago, we had to cancel our reservation due to illness. We canceled with less than 24 hours. We were told that they would charge us for one night (reasonably), but if they were able to book the room, they would refund our money.  About two hours after we canceled, we received a call from them telling us they had been able to book the room, and we wouldn't be charged.   That's the Outside Inn we loved. This new one? I'd rather sleep in a tent than put up with this ridiculous cancellation policy.  So if you're going there, be aware. You could lose every penny if something causes you to cancel. I have never heard of a cancellation policy this harsh in all my travels.   My recommendation? Stay somewhere else!…",2
349,"This is a conveniently located hotel, just a couple of minutes walk to the river front. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. There are plenty of bakeries and restaurants nearby, so you’ll be spoilt for choice.    The room was reasonable, although it did not offer ‘city views’ as promised when we made the booking. Although the hotel was clean, there was an awful odour in the elevator. It is possible the odour emanated from the dampness due to the rains outside. The WiFi in the room was extremely patchy.    There is plenty to see and do near the hotel. Recommend a tram ride from St. Francis church to Foz, and a walk across Dom Louis bridge to Gaia.

So I spoke with the manager and after a while he gave us a normal room with a king bed. Still, no crib. Still, dirty. I found a sock under the bed and that sock wasn’t mine for sure!

I stayed in a room on the side away from the tram overlooking a small park/playground. This was very quiet and I did not hear any noise at all. The room was equipped with all the basics. Very clean. One small downside here is the bedsheets were a little rough and there was only  single. They could maybe invest in some decent quality cotton sheets and an extra pillow.  Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was simple but nice. A buffet with hot and and cold selections. It was open from 7am to 11am. My only complaint with the food was that the bacon was so salty as to be inedible. Otherwise all of it was delicious. …",4

The breakfast buffet was okay, but you can have a better breakfast around the corner at the bakery on Kurfürstenstrasse with espresso coffee and fresh orange juice. On either side of the hotel you have Asian restaurants, one Thai, the other Vietnamese. And across you have a reasonable Italian restaurant. What else do you need? Definitely recommended!",4

Next time I will pay the extra 20 dollars so I have a room I can move in and a bed that's not the size of a twin but called a queen. ",1

The staff are nice and including, and our room was just beautiful. It was small but well designed, and everything from the furnitures to the wall paper had a touch of luxury. The bathroom was new and tasteful as well.   The breakfast is included and the selection of food is very good. I would be happy to stay at Myer's Hotel under my next trip to Berlin. ",4

We booked an overnight at Inn at the Opera because it is close to  symphony hall. We arrived at check in time, 3pm. We were looking forward to their valet parking as we had driven in to the City from the South Bay.  They informed us that their valet was full and we'd have to find a public parking lot to put the car. They gave us our room key and told us that the room was on the second floor which was cooler and would be facing the main street for a view. However, the room faced a cement wall off a very dirty roof ledge. The room was so small you could hardly move. When we called down to the desk, the staff person, Erika was very rude and said she…",1

The location is impeccable, obviously, I reccomend this area for people in need of peace and quietness within walking distance (well...as walking distance as Berlin can be:) to both Museums Insel, ALexanderplatz, art galleries around Mitte and to nice boutiques, quaint cafes etc. Close yet far from the agitation of bigger boulevards. Close to all essential transportation means for getting around the city.   In terms of service and staff support, it is a true 4 stars, ultra-clean, the double room that we had was large and comfy. We loved the modern touch of the shower room/wet room and its lighting:). Decor a bit pop-cliche boutique but well compensated by the…",4

I had very low expectations as I knew 60,000 were descending upon SF and all the good hotels would be booked. I read the reviews and thought ""at least it's clean.""  Clean, it was not.  My room was disgusting as you can see by the pics.  This hotel has not been updated in decades. I spent a little less than $400/night and it wasn't even worth $50.  I've stayed in budget hotels/inns and they've always, at a minimum, been clean. I had no blanket on my bed and when I requested one, I received one with what looked like, moth holes. (see pic).

However I was very disappointed by the service, particularly the front desk. When we arrived (around 12.30), there was only one person at the front desk. Apparently the hotel was full and the front desk manager was completely overwhelmed. I waited a very long time, was attended by someone who clearly made me feel like I was an annoyance, took a long time ""find"" my reservation, to finally learn that our rooms were not ready (at this point it was about 2pm).

Breakfast was good and served on the ground floor. Mani restaurant is run in the evening. I tried it once and the food was very good. I would stay at this hotel again.",4
373,"The standard rooms and service left our stay feeling like more of a drag. The standard room is the size of a closet. I've stayed at the Hilton Chicago which was 3x the size- much nicer. I suppose that could be due to the history of the hotel, but it just wasn't portrayed accurately in pictures. It was kind of a bummer walking into the room. Also, anytime you want to call the front desk, be prepared to wait on hold for 15 minutes. My biggest grievance of my stay was calling at 5pm before dinner to request a new comforter and extra pillow then to return from dinner with that request being ignored. When trying to call the front desk, I waited on hold for ten minutes and just walked downstairs instead- where it wasn't busy, so I don't know why the phones weren't being answered. When…",1

This apartment checked all the boxes. First of all the staff was really friendly and helpful. The room was well-designed and fully equipped with everything you would need for cooking etc. Getting around the city was very easy from here; the S-bahn next to the building + the tram-stop within a 5 minute walk were both very convenient. Hope to be back soon and would easily recommend this place to anyone :-)",5

We should have insisted on seeing the rooms first off and stayed just one night. We booked a Queen with private en suite.

Continental breakfast is good.  Hotel staff wanted $340 pesos to hail a taxi early in the morning but it cost me under 120 pesos from the airport to the hotel.  Something is not right.

Got in the room (1706) that is next to the elevator and there’s a party on the floor, I went downstairs to get a new room.

I then called the next morning demanding to speak to the manager and after speaking to him he phoned back only to say he has exhausted all avenues and the shoes were  not turned in to lost and found.  Surely, a hotel of this caliber would hire trustworthy employees.  Very disappointed and we will not be returning to this hotel in the future.

We were a bit disappointing about the catering offers at the bar - even though the menu itself offered some agreeable snacks our choice was limited by quite a number of them not being available. With regards to sleeping quality my partner's and my view differed - whereas I found the hotel too noisy (background noises) he was ok. So, maybe it's not so good for people who need it extra-quiet when they want to go to sleep. Apart from that a nice hotel - even with those points of critique I would come back. :)",4

He refused to give me smaller change one morning though I said I would take coins (and I saw a drawer full of coins). He was also less than helpful at check-in when he replied simply that there were “no guarantees for a room before 3pm.” I know this and normally stay at brands where I have status to help guarantee an available room.

On this recent visit last week I arrived at 9.30pm after travelling from 4am only to have to wait for 25mins to check in because they only had 1 member of staff. The girl on reception was managing a customer complaint and none of the other staff despite my requests were willing to help, even through there was a queue of 6 people waiting. Finally the customer service once another member of staff became available was poor and unapologetic. A hotel of this calibre needs to work on its customer service.",2

I think the back side was a great view from that height to see a little more of the Barcelona fabric. Just balconies, backyards and pool of some other homes/buildings; something you can enjoy other than just the television.   The only negative we felt at the apartments was the check-in process. We were travelling with our 7 month old baby, arrived at the hotel at 1:30pm (check-in is at 3pm).

Breakfast is across the road in one building, with the pools, and the gym is in another building. On the plus side, the rooms are fairly large, great for three people with a sliding door for privacy in between the lounge and bedroom.  The hotel is perfect for disabled access too, with everything from ramps, wider doors and SOS buttons.

What lets the hotel down is the little things. Nothing in the in-room fridge - if you arrive late at night you might want some water during the night. No slippers or robes. We did ask for some given we were there for 3-days. Reception staff said they would send some up but didn't.

We might have been unlucky, we arrived on a Sunday evening, the owner was away etc....

Location is perfect for access to Charles de Gaulle airport, either by taxi, or RER train and métro. Walkable for many major attractions and neighbourhoods.

I find this place offers good value and quality for a stay in Paris.",5

Also the lockers were too small to really put any of your valuables safely away.,2

There is absolutely nothing to do here - no entertainment and the hotel location is in the middle of nowhere - approx 20 min taxi between Danang and Hoi An. It's sprawled out design makes it feel like a suburban apartment complex.

This particular area of Barcelona (the Gothic Quarter) is wonderful place to stay.  You are two blocks from the Harbor area and right in the middle of so many charming streets to wander through in the Gothic Quarter.  You can also easily walk to La Rambla, Plaza Catalunya  and the Picasso Museum. Some other good things about the hotel are that there was a comfortable, nicely decorated lounge/bar area, a couple of the staff were very friendly and helpful and we were given an upgraded room with two balconies.

They believe that people are stupid and don't understand the trick... In addition to this, a person who works there sell us the tickets to go to Alcatraz for 80$ each. When we went to Pier 33 we discovered that the price to go there was half prize: 40$ each. The tickets were sold out, he said. Incredibile!!!

She even rudely doubted the authenticity of my reservation. When I requested for two adjoining rooms, she seemed annoyed and talked like I did not have any choice as to the location of my room. No explanation for the room location, amenities, wifi -- nothing. She just gave us the keys and pointed to the elevator. The room is cramped for 3 people (even though they allow four people). There are also ""interesting"" characters who hang out at the lobby at night. San Francisco downtown has…",1
420,"As a fellow hotelier, I don't normally post negative reviews as I understand how TripAdvisor can be very subjective. After my recent stay in Sao Paulo, however, I feel like I need to warn the business traveler against wasting their money in a hotel like this. Being a business hotel, you would think that they understand what business travelers require during their stay: international plug adapters, flexibility of check-in/check-out, wi-fi that actually works, housekeeping service that is efficient, ability to answer your questions at the Front Desk. I must say, that in my recent stay, NONE of these were true and I just went through headache after headache. For the price you are paying at this hotel, you should receive all of the above. Be careful and seriously consider other…",2
421,Stayed for three nights.  Nice welcome on arrival.  Room is very well laid out with plent of power points available and good quality wifi.  The bed was comfortable and the bathroom well laid out with everything you would need.  A decent sized safe is provided together with plenty of hanging space.  Breakfast had a good variety of options and very good service.  Location is only a couple of minutes from Checkpoint Charlie and also from the Stadtmitte station so easy to get around the city.,4

As well they are suing maintenance by morning, so you can hear guys knocking by 6 am.  They don’t have restaurant or living room on the entrance.   The update will be awesome (the room is refurbished) but during the construction period I highly recommend staying at other hotel.",1
426,"Really good location being right next to public transport stops, and being fairly cheap compared to other places. Rooms were great, VERY spacious and decent toilet/shower. Bed comfy. Staff were very helpful. Sleep was perfect as well!!  Negatives?? Food was lovely, but breakfast is a little pricey ",5
427,"This hotel is quite nice and well located. 2 minutes from the metro. The room are practical and we had no noise at the other side of the building. We stayed 6 nights. Nothing to say except that the locker does not work. The batheroom is small but functionnal. If you take metro tickets at the station, they take bankenotes. Everything is quite close by metro (10 stations from Alexander Place...)",4

Rooms are fine, but the shower leaks all over the room (all the way to the corridor) and the noise on the rooms are TERRIBLE!! Around 5:00AM the buses at Estación Retiro begin to work and there is no way you can sleep with that noise. I was at he 14th floor (woww Starwood preferred floor) but still the noise was really loud. I can't imagine what they do to ""std"" guests... Never coming back to this hotel! ",2

We had booked a triple room and then had to wait while they brought up the spare bed and squeezed it in. Then we didn't have enough towels, coffee etc for 3 people. Not a great location down a mud track either. Dinner was a disaster for us too with the dancer asking us to join her before we had even ordered a drink and the music was not to our taste and nor was the food having had such a wide choice in other hotels. On the plus side the hotel was certainly different in decor and had a nice pool.",2

We immediately packed all of our belongings up and demanded an new room because the roach crawled back into the mirror and was undetectable. Then I requested that we weren't charged the resort fee because of the roach incident. The lady at the front desk stated she would put that in the notes for when we checked out. The next day we came back from the beach and the room looked completely untouched. Our bed wasn't made up , the sheets weren't changed, and we were left a bill for a dirty towel ,rag, and pillowcase. Mind you when we called down for rags they said they were having a laundry issue so we had to…",1
434,I booked this through airbnb. Buried well into the listing you learn it's a hotel. Thirty minutes after booking for one week I realized I had made a mistake and tried to cancel. The owner told me they had a three night minimum stay(a lie) and that she would have to charge me an extra twenty dollars per night if I checked out early. All of this was a sham. She's trying to have it both ways-a humble apartment rental and normal hotel. I realize now I that had I booked on one of the hotel sights I would have gotten it for forty less than I paid and had no issue with their cancellation policy. It really left a bad taste in my mouth. Owner is shady.   The employees however are amazing as is the breakfast. It's a shame they are not the owners. The room is slightly above average at…,2

Our reservations were messed up and when we asked to speak to the manager, he was of course out.  What a relief, we considered that an invalid contract and drove down the street to a place that looked less life threatening.  The people ahead of us had the same situation with their reservation and no authority figure was there to help.",1

Room was perfect for my needs with everything clean, tidy and comfortable.  Every staff member i came across was brilliant and extemely helpful.  The breakfast is well worth it and i would definitely recommend.  As a frequent visitor to the city i will now stay here every time.   Well done to all of your excellent team.  We loved staying there and will continue to do so in the future when we visit.  ",5

A special mention for Anna W on Reception, who was so helpful at check in. The only thing I can think of to criticise is that the trays at breakfast aren't very big. ",5
439,"I stayed in this hotel for one week. The location is ok, but not optimal, you still have a couple of blocks to the beach and I would recommend that you look for a beach front hotel for this price. The service and rooms are not worth your while of being away from the beach. The rooms are very small (even though I was in a superior room). The bed was a queen or king made of two smaller beds - very uncomfortable. Besides the bed, there was hardly any space. The bathroom was very small as well and some of the walls were plain concrete (no paint or decor). Aside from the room itself, I think the major drawback of this hotel is the service, in particular the front desk staff. Do NOT expect any sort of help or assistance from them. Check in time is at 2 pm and do not expect them to…",2

444,My wife and I spent two days at the Movenpick in Amsterdam at the end of a Viking river cruise so this hotel was booked through Viking. We did have the option to upgrade to the Pulitzer Hotel(and maybe we should have) at additional expense. The Movenpick was okay but it was not close to the points of interest in Amsterdam although the tram was fairly convenient. If I had it do over I would up grade to the Pulitzer Hotel.,3
445,"This is what you can expect for a big budget hotel chain in a big city. The room was compact but not too small for comfort. The wifi was good. The view of the street was plain. It was about 5-10 mins walk to the nearest Metro line – there are two stations nearby, and the zoo is also close by. The breakfast is expensive so we chose not to take it and ate out. There are many Asian restaurants nearby.",4
446,"Our stay at this hotel was unpleasant. Mainly, because of the moldy or really humid smell of the room, like old wet carpet. If you can't bear this type of smell, please choose somewhere else. The hotel is a bit dated. Also at night time there are some funky people hanging out, not saying that it is unsafe, because the hotel does have security. It could just be the Copacabana night crowd. I didn't even get to the pool or breakfast, because we just wanted to be in the hotel as little as possible.  The layout of the room in itself is not bad, but small. Bathroom was soso, the shower area let some water out and the handles quite loose. The room had a little balcony, with views of neighbouring old apartment building.

The lobby (also a public bar/restaurant) was a cozy space with solid wifi that is perfect for chatting with friends or working on a laptop. The bathrooms were clean, the bedrooms had a variety of perks (curtains and personal outlet for each bed), and the rooftop terrace had a great view. The only downside was the rooms didn't have adequate AC. The staff was particularly friendly -- thank you to Marion, Aliana, Lilitz, Anna Belle, Dorian, Edgar, Leo, and Francesca for the advice and French help. (Sorry for any name misspellings.)",5

I don't know about you but I'm willing to wait if that is the cleanliness standard I'm getting. Room itself was impeccable. I travel quite often for work and to be honest that's the first room I had no reservations about.  SERVICE Nice, helpful, smiling. It was a pleasure to interact with the staff of GPC Hotel.

Negatives.... the pool was (or at least looked) very dirty and unappealing. The ""suite"" room was pretty much just a extra large room with lots of wasted space. If you stay in one of the rooms on street side, it can get pretty loud in the morning. Probably more ideal to stay on the pool side.",2

Unfortunately she wasn't always there. The others were absolutely clueless. Bad directions, terrible recommendations and indifferent attitude.] The bathroom didn't come w hair conditioner and front desk didnt keep power converters which would normally be an inconvenience but because it was a holiday and most stores were closed, became a real annoyance.

I can imagine that many other guests would have had  a much better experience, but I'm not reviewing the hotel based on their stay, it is based on my own stay.   The hotel itself is located between two favelas, but that isn't much of a problem, because they are quite far away. It's a bit out of the way of the beaches, but they have a decent shuttle that has many stops along the way from Sheraton to Rio Sol shopping centre. This includes Leblon beach, Ipanema Beach and a few stops along Copacabana beach. Easy enough to get around that part of Rio, especially with the many yellow cabs. You can walk from Ipanema back to the hotel, but it might take nearly 45 min and beware the burning sun. The concierge was…",2

My room was ready but they wouldn't let me in it unless I paid 1/2 day extra because I was ahead of check in time. I wouldn't mind if the room was occupied but it was sitting there empty and made up. I travel all the time and never has a hotel charged me to get into the room early if it is empty. The guy on reception had a really poor attitude - not interested in helping me - I didn't even get help with my bags after having to agree to the extra cost. The rooms are shabby and the bathroom looks like a prison cell. Definitely won't be staying here again - customer service is everything, a small gesture this morning would have gone a long way - now they will have lost my business…",2

Would not recommend staying here if you are going to use valet parking,1

We could see numerous good restaurants from our balcony but there was no rear access or entry available to access them. It required doing the trek down to reception around a few blocks and the up a massive hill. Being in our 60's with bad knees this prevented us from visiting.  The toilet was faulty, the fridge was inaccessible and completely frozen over. They charged €5 for a bucket of ice.

Modern, comfy firm beds and good room amenities but service tarnished this happy feedback.  There was a hiccup during the check-in process and the front office agent was not helpful in resolving our issue. We had to do our own work to show them the right reservation. Throughout our stay the front office staff lacked warmth was very transactional. When it was finally resolved, they just expressed a brief apology.  To add to this, one evening we came back to our room after a day out in town to find out that our room was never cleaned! After a call to housekeeping, they apologized that the maid is new and thus could not get to our room (this was 6pm)! No service…",3
466,The best thing about this hotel is the reception staff who were very helpful. Breakfast is very basic. Room was just about OK. There is no bar; if you want a drink you have to sit in the dining room with diners. I noticed quite a few guests were sitting in the lobby instead. This is a serious deficiency for a business traveller. The location is not so good or even safe for restaurants or bars unless you go to the local shopping centre which has some very good choices.,2

We didn't have breakfast at the hotel as it was €27 and there are plenty of cheap places nearby at Checkpoint Charlie.  A few disappointing things. We requested a list for the mini bar and the grumpy women on reception said it would take 1-2 days, we didn't have long enough to wait! Also there was no price list for massage and never anyone up there to ask. The sauna was a nice addition but the steam room didn't work.",4

Upon my request to match a room rate found on a third party website they did so without hesitation.   Our room was located on the third floor across from the elevator. It was quiet and comfortable. Especially the shower was very relaxing and sufficient in terms of space. Paris hotel rooms are usually on the smaller side, but this room had a very convenient layout and was tastefully decorated. Great eye for detail. The only thing that could be missed is a mini fridge, but of course this would take up extra space and they provide an honesty bar.  Breakfast was good too. Not very extensive, but this is also quite common for Paris. Perhaps the addition of some vegetables like tomatoes and cucumber would've been nice and even though you could order a variety of eggs for room service breakfast it didn't seem to be an option in the breakfast room. We didn't ask however so maybe we are mistaken. The pastries were very tasty though.  Location of the hotel is very convenient with plenty of metro options, restaurants, cafes and supermarkets nearby. It is also within walking distance of some sights. It is located in a quiet dead end street which is good for sleeping at night.  The staff was very friendly, spoke very good english and generally created a very homey vibe while maintaining a professional attitude.  We would definitely stay here again if we come back to Paris.…",5

We were there celebrating a friend's birthday who had fallen in love with the villa at the sight of the photos... and it was quite like the photos had shown, but didn't quite live up to the promises made by the websites we looked at before we went.   Overall, our stay was ok. The beds were good, and we had the basic necessities. But it was disappointing to be so underwhelmed with what had been promised vs what was delivered. Especially because staying there had been our big ""splurge"" of the trip, and we paid about $3,100 for a 4 night stay, after discounts and off season pricing. This villa is absolutely lovely if you go into it not expecting it to be a five star luxury location, but a cozy, decent place to make your base…",3
485,"Stayed there during the WC. The location is great, right on the beach. The hotel rooms however look exactly as they would have in the 1960s. Door handles fell off and aircon unit covers broke off also while we were there.  If you do stay here, get a deluxe room which have balconies and face the sea. The standard rooms are at the back of the hotel wiling neither of those two.  Wifi was terrible except in the lobby. Breakfast and Service were basic but acceptable.  If you get a good price, this place might be ok for you - but if you are fastidious about new bathrooms etc avoid this hotel",2
486,"Hotel was clean and located nearby train station, EDEKA, and a neighbourhood mall. Also walking distance to a few kebab stalls and small bars/restaurants. Away from the city, but is conveniently close to many amenities.",4
487,We had a great experience at this hotel from the staff to the rooms. The staff was extremely helpful in help us from books tickets to telling us how to get there and recommending  restaurants. The location was good as there is a metro station a little ways away and multiple bus stops around the hotel. And did I mention the Eiffel Tower is around the corner. I will definitely go back to this hotel again. ,5
488,"I would advise to book this hotel, great view if you have a room on the third floor, great view from the pools; you can have a great view from the restaurant if you eat in the balcony. If you like to travel and look around the Madeira, book it. I found very boring at nights; only old French people there :) nowhere to go at night. Food is very basic at the restaurant. I'd recommend to book room only without food for people who eat meat and fish. There are a few places to eat across the street. Much better food there than in the restaurant. Bus stop is also across the street. Taxi is also there, if you are 5-6 people it is worth taking the taxi, you would pay the same price you'd pay on the bus. Around 12 euro to go to Funchal ( don't pay more! ;) I had great holiday! I travelled…",3
489,"My family of 4 stayed here for 9 nights at the beginning of July 2018 and we had a fabulous experience. Extremely friendly staff who were always on hand to accommodate any request.  The rooms were spacious and very well serviced.  The breakfast was such a high standard and the coffee was so good.  We had a number of great conversations with members of staff and in particular Helena and Alexandra, who were happy to recommend great places to eat and great things to do.  We would like to recommend this hotel very highly.",5
490," It is refurbished, very clean, well designed, and very cheap even it's close to Louvre Museum side. The hotel is also very close to Republique Square where is surronded by many restaurants, cafes and bars. The hotel has open buffet breakfast which is reasonable and cheap. If you don't mind sizes of rooms book it right now!",5
491,"Where are the fruits from Madeira at breakfast? Where are the traditional Madeira dishes at lunch and dinner? Instead of paella and roast chicken you should show the beautiful tuna, swordfish, seafood, sweet potatoes, inhame, etc.  Also, in Portugal you should offer expresso coffees to the guests and not the english light coffee with milk. People expect authenticity and tradition.  The bathrooms are good and the rooms are spacious but the decoration is outdated.  The little beach nearby is nice.  Madeira wine should be served slightly chilled and not room temperature.",3
492,"Mandala Suites is a well-reviewed apartment-hotel at the U Bahn Stadt-Mitte station, so an easy walk or ride to anywhere you would want to go.  Suite include equipped kitchens, and there are excellent supermarkets nearby.  Spacious, comfortable.  Some small maintenance issues, but overall well run.  ",4
493,"I wasn't expecting a room that was suitable for a brothel, not that I have anything against rooms suitable for a brothel. There were more mirrors than the Hall of mirrors at Madame Tussaud's. So the 200 of me, reflected in the mirrors, will write this review. For the price the place was fine, a much larger, better equipped room than I was expecting for the price. I slept in more comfortable beds, also had a bulb missing and been in dirtier places for more money than this. It was clean, water hot, quiet enough, very good for the price. Only down was the Intermittent performance of the Internet.",3
494,Easy access from central station. Rooms are clean Internet quality good. Nice roof top views.  Cleaning ness of outlets can be much better. Need more bar staff for quicker service. Should serve more varieties for breakfast like hot eggs. receptionist is arrogant overworked stressed and rude. Lady not fit for hospitality. Needs learn how to smile. Charged for 2 breakfast and late check out..both not had/asked for.  Neighbourhood is packed with small restaurants. Parks close-by. Would not stay here again.,3
495,"This post is especially for Starwood folks looking to try some of the new Marriott options.  First red flag in this hotel is the elevator which has no security.  Meaning anyone can go to any floor without a keycard.  Why is this important?  Well most hotels in SF have this keycard security in place in their elevators as it deters crime and parties.  This business caters to folks that are in the oldest profession, obviously drug deals and so not a kid-friendly hotel at all.  Also parties.  I stayed in room 1201 sharing one wall with room 1203 and the other wall with the un-secured stairway.  At 2:45 am very drunk men in room 1205 decided to inflate an additional mattress in the stairway and loudly and obnoxiously try to get that mattress already inflated into their room.  To us,…",1

Yes, lift & Rooms are small, which we found out we're standard. However, well maintained and good quality.  Reception team very helpful and assisted with Luggage storage.  Really enjoyed our short stay here.. Thanks to the First Hotel Team Josh & Barry",5
497,Great little hotel in a good location. Each room is unique and look amazing. Easy access to metros and trains. The staff were fantastic and couldn't do enough for us. The 24/7 free coffee machine was a lovely touch too. I would definitely stay in this hotel again when I next stay in Paris,5
498,"This is honestly horrible, outdated and poor service with a busy noisy location!  We booked their suits but on the second night they said we have to move to their junior suit because the suit we were staying at was sold out and they weren’t nice about it and when we got to the smaller suit the shower was in a bathtub and was very small for a family of 4... the manger and the supervisor were not only nice about it but kind of rude and dismissive... Anyway I don’t recommend this hotel, base on my experience, location is in a bad noisy area the hotel is outdated and very dirty.  ",1
499,I stayed at peppers docklands in march 2017. Firstly did not not get the room I booked and then the room smelled like it hasn't been cleaned for a while. The staff were not helpful at all in trying to resolve issues. I was then charged an extra  $45.00 a day for parking. I will be spending my hard earned money elsewhere next time I'm in Melbourne and advise you to do the same.,2
500,Reserved through Travelocity. Told first night paid and guaranteed. Arrived at 12:30 am and told they had given our room away. Had done this to 4 other couples the same night.  No integrity in dealing with the matter.  A stain on an otherwise lovely weekend.,1
501,Thank god we only had one night here! Photos are very deceiving with small rooms and a tiny ensuite with a shower that is akin to deciphering the divinci code. Hotel staff were dismissive and short. Hotel itself was also run down with a sense of tacky modernity to make up for it. Cleanliness and hygiene seemed like an afterthought.  The elevator lights insinuated previous drug taking was rife.  Save $50 a night and head to the The Orchard Hotel. ,1
502,"I stayed here for 5 nights, and one of the attractions was free wifi, but unfortunately it broke down and wasn't available for our entire stay. Also, the hot water broke down for a day, and so that meant freezing  showers. The fridge in the room froze all our food we bought at Wholefoods which we had to throw out. We told the front desk numerous times about these problems, but were not offered anything in return for the inconvenience we experienced. Oh, and the room was very noisy on the weekend nights due to nearby nightclubs and pubs.",1
503,"I've given this hotel 3 out of 5. Here is why Great: Beds, location, bar, leafy and quiet street with great team link 200 yards away.  Average: Rooms, breakfast, ambience, lack of air con in main areas  The website for Max Brown looks really cool and trendy so your expectations are... Hoxton Hotel/Soho House type experience but in reality it's more show than wow!  It won't take much though... But more atmosphere in the bar ( music) and better ventilation / fresh air in communal areas... I was hot and it was February.  I would however recommend it as a great base and good sleep in alive my leafy suburb.",3

Champs Elyeeses and the arc de triomphe and millions of restaurants cinema and clothes shops and this is just a small part of the Paris experience great rooms quiet lovely period coving tall ceilings lovely decorative iron lift  i recommend this place,5
506,"This is an old house that has been converted to an hotel. It has some character, but you can hear everything from the other rooms. The breakfast is great and the service too. Very friendly hosts. The balcony is great for a coffee in the morning. The main problem though is location. There's no public transportation near-by and even for Uber is hard to get there. I wouldn't recommend if you want to stay near the center. If not, then it is a nice place to stay",3
507,"Spent four nights at the Movenpick Hotel, in October. It was close to the main rail station, about a five minute walk. But not close to anything else. We were on the eleventh floor, with a great view of the river and the central train station. King bed was hard and leaned out from the middle. Rooms were clean. Breakfast, on site, was 25 Euros. Expensive for what you got. Unfortunately, because of the Hotel's location there were very few options. There was a small café just down the street - Ipo's Coffee Gallery. Good pastries and sandwiches. It opens at 8:30 am, but is closed on Saturday. Concierge at the Movenpick was the best thing about the hotel. Several times he was very helpful with info and arranging transportation. Next time we'll stay in a hotel in the city centre.",3

509,"Everything about the actual hotel was great. Friendly and helpful staff, nice room, good wifi, and a decent breakfast included. The downside is if you're traveling on vacation it is a couple miles from the area you most likely came to visit. I only stayed one night and then moved to a hotel more in the city center. ",3
510,"We reserved a block of rooms for my daughters wedding.  I reserved my room months in advance.  When it came to check-in, I was given a completely different room, only two beds, not suite, and I was the mother of the bride!!!!!  This room was on the ground floor, right across the hall from the front desk.  The noise and traffic were ridiculous.  After two nights out of three, I finally complained so much they moved me to a suite on the 3rd floor.  Finally!!!  Don't accept a room on the ground floor.  Also, don't bother to look at the cute photos posted on their website.  They have redecorated in black formica - Headboards, nightstands, etc.  They are catering to folks bound for Wrigley field, so they have gone with stuff that will take a beating.  No quaint antiques, no…",1
511,"Our family of 4 all loved Hotel Les Matins!   The staff was all so wonderful, giving us recommendations for nearby restaurants among other helpful tips..  Our teens were thrilled to have their own room and bathroom, and the neighborhood was very quiet and safe....we would have felt totally comfortable letting our kids walk around without us to explore all the bakeries, shops, and various boutiques.   The breakfast was extremely convenient for a busy day trying to run out the door, and the honor bar was perfect for relaxing before dinner after a full day of sightseeing or enjoying a nightcap!    Spa was also great with a eucalyptus steam room.     Would have loved to have bought some of their bath/both products, so I need to look them up on Amazon!    Definitely recommend this…",5

513,"We travelled to Santorini for a family wedding with our 3 year old. To date our only holiday with child was to all inclusive family resort so this was rather different to what we were used to. On the whole Santorini is not geared to families and the combination of the heat and a temperamental small child meant we didn’t manage to get out to see much of the island.   On arrival at midnight we found the man at check in rather curt and were disappointed with the rather bland room with loud fridge and air con and very small double bed. The room was not the best but it was bigger than that of many of our party and ground floor so easily accessible with buggy. It served a purpose although we did not sleep very well, my husband was way too long for the bed and it was noisy. Breakfast…",3
514,"The Hotel, rooms, staff were top class. The downside is the restaurant, its not big enough for the number of guests. The quality of the food is good, the quantity is good, but the choice is very limited. Its either one type of fish or meat plus a limited choice of vegetables and salad.  It certainly does not fulfil a 4 star rating, in the food department.",3

When we arrived we were told that only four of the five couples could check in. As we sat in the lobby we watched several other hotel guests check in early and received their room keys. We asked again and we're told we'd have to wait. At the time of check in we were again told that we still couldn't check in as our room wasn't ready. We left our luggage in a friends room and went to dinner. When we came back we were able to check in. As we entered our room it was immediately noticeable that the floor was sopping wet. The toilet was overflowing and backing up into the entryway. We called the desk and had a…",1

The location is good within the party places of amsterdam and is nearby to the museum district. A major tram stop is also at walking distance. The breakfast was good, lot better than other hostels that I have stayed in. The staff was a bit cold though and the place was quite dull, boring and not happening. People were simply not mingling with each other. The air conditioning wasn't working, so it was quite hot.",3
518,For the second time we had a fantastic weekend at Savoy hotel. Savoy is a hotel with atmosphere and the rooms are good and spacious.  We booked a small suite that was lovely.

The Apartment was newly remodeled and clean with all updated appliances and fixtures. On the negative side one bed room was a bit smaller than expected as the floor plan on the web site reflected equal size bed rooms. I guess all of the rooms were not of equal size.  The day time representative Alex was very helpful in obtaining our pre-purchased Sagrada Famila tickets, and made our check out day run smoothy by calling a cab for our party, Thank you! The location was perfect to walk to restaurants and pastry shops as well as Goudi's famous Famila.",4

524, 눉Rooms were way smaller than in the pictures. Not as modern appliances either. I was told they were fully equipped kitchens when I called to ask about pots and pans.Kitchenete was far from fully equipped. Metal spoons with old scratched teflon pans. When food was re heated the microwave popped due to pieces of teflon in our food. Pictures very misleading. Fake wood floors cracked and sticking up. Beds hard as a rock and every time you rolled over it creaked and the headboard moved. First night was cold all night due to the heat not coming on. Asked staff they said it takes a while for the water to reach the top floors. Then suggested we had two electric space heaters. Plugged he heaters in and blew the fuse to our room. Had to wait 30+ minutes to get it back up and running.…,1
525,"One would think that a hotel like the InterContinental a ""luxury"" hotel would be in better shape.  Unfortunately I am not sure if this is consistent throughout the location, but my room was less than luxurious.  The carpet was very stained and needed to be replaced of cleaned, the shower had something sticking out from under the glass door, the curtains on the window broke the moment i touched them to close.  I tried to communicate this to the MOODY, ANGRY front desk person (Whan/Lahn) and got little response.  The bed was not a heavenly bed in any way.

The hotel was still everything that I had hoped it would be from my memory. The same friendly staff, the same beautiful and well-kept rooms, the same great location, the same bathroom supplies (from l'Occitane En Provence) and the same wonderful and comfortable beds (which I still believe to be the most comfortable beds in all of Paris).   The hotel is in the well-located Rue Cler area of Paris, just a 10-minute walk to the Eiffel Tower. It is also within walking distance of the Louvre, the Musee d'Orsay, the Arc de Triomphe, and many, many more sights. A metro is within a five-minute walk as…",5

My door was not shut all the way, and this psycho,tried to get in the room, was yelling, calling me names. Good thing my friend was there, b/c he started to forcefully get in the room as he was yelling he was going to stab and rob me- but we were able to push him out.

We left to explore the city the next day and when we came back around 8 PM the room was not clean. No one had come in to freshen up the room.

Some rooms or suites have a private jacuzzi, but obviously much more expensive. We didn't think that not having a pool would be such a big deal, but after being in the heat, a pool is exactly what we would have needed. The goal of our trip was to have a romantic, relaxing getaway, but with no pool, there was nothing to do at the hotel to keep us there during the days.

The walk into town is a solid 20 mins, it didn't bother us too much but it is worth noting.  The rooms were basic.  Very basic. This wouldn't be an issue if it was reflected in the pricing, I thought it was overpriced for the quality.  Staff were average.  Breakfast was poor and the room was always so so busy.  Maybe they need to extend breakfast by an hour?  The wifi situation was difficult also.  It was only available in the lobby and incredibly slow.

The room (we upgraded to the slightly larger standard) was as described, it is a little on the smaller side but as I would expect in any capital city esp. Paris, there was however plenty of room for bags and moving around. The bathroom and shower room were very clean and the 2 person shower a treat.

Also on the Saturday night we decided to eat in the lobby which was a disaster!  Waited for ages when our food came no cutlery or napkins.   I must say there were only two people on duty to look after a very busy bar .   They did their best , especially Vladimir  who seemed to be quite embarrassed with the setup!  We had enjoyed the Sky Bar on the previous evening, great spot.  Also there was a very good breakfast selection!",3

If you receive a treatment you are permitted to use the facilities for as long as desired...I stayed 4+ hours both times and staff did not seem to mind! My only complaint about the Spa is regarding the massage rooms.  Both times I received a 90 minute massage (which was excellent!) however the treatment rooms border the street.

It’s very new and has very well appointed rooms but the staff and their training fall very short of Marriott standards   I was not greeted as a titanium member nor was I asked which free gift I wanted.  I was not advised about any upgrade and had to ask!  It was confirmed I was upgraded but honestly I don’t believe them. The room photos on the room in booked versus the one I stayed in were identical.  With around 90 nights last year in SPG/Marriott hotels being given fake upgrades is very tiresome and generally a USA trick not Asia.  Whilst the room was clean and comfortable it was miles apart from the upgraded rooms (suites!) I have enjoyed in most…",2
551,Location is convenient but that is all that is going for this hotel. Terrible customer service where the reception staff are rude and unhelpful. Our room was not cleaned until at least after 4pm every day. The breakfast is very basic and not worth including as part of your stay. Would not recommend. ,1
552,"I have made a reservation based on the information provided by booking.com. It’s supposed to be a 5 star hotel but it is simply not! What 5 star hotel have no tea/coffee facilities in the room? What 5star hotel have no iron? Furniture looks outdated, I can’t open curtains because I have room with no blinds or vail curtains, so therefore have to use artificial lights all day long. Bathroom reminds me of nothing more than a travel lodge standard, horrible and plastic curtain in the bath! How this place received 5 star rating??? It is a joke! ",3
553,"The hotel is very nicely furnished and the rooms are smart, clean and well kitted out. The problem with the rooms is the total lack of noise insulation. One morning at 7.00am it sounded like there was a horse clopping around in the room above us and on another occasion we were woken by the cleaner in the room next door. None of the floors are carpeted so some of the time the noises around you are as bad as a firework down your underpants.  When I arrived I was told that I was to have a single room despite me booking a double. I booked the room through Expedia who had said that I wanted a double, but because the hotel only had singles available and I was alone, they put me in a single on my first night. Not impressive!   If you stay at Zenit Lisboa and the hotel staff don't mess…",3
554,"Pleasant stay here. It's right on the edge of Barcelona but close to beach and only a few metro stops from centre. I had a 19th floor room with view, slept well although bed a bit hard the room was quiet and clean. Breakfast was OK. It is next to a shopping mall with large food court so good dining options near by (and they open at 7pm so you do not have to wait all evening for Spanish opening times!) I did not have time to check out pool facilities unfortunately.",4

We did get the room requested, top floor not overlooking Bush St. But the room was dingy, seemed dirty, had a fan blasting away and it was too noisy to consider sleeping with the windows open. We didn't open a bag, just booked into another hotel,paid for one night and left.   The staff were very pleasant however.",1

The ice cream shop was ok though...",1
558,"This hotel is all about the view : amazing view on Copacabana beach ( so make sure you have a room with a view on the ocean)  The infrastructure ( lifts, restaurant, gym, spa, pool) otherwise seriously need to be renovated. The hotel tends also to be really busy ( I generally go for meetings in December) so service is hit-and-miss in spite of the good will of most staff.  Overall Rio is about outdoor so not a bad choice if your budget is limited and you want to be on Copacabana. ",2
559,"We spent 3 nights in Hotel de Provence.  We had a large balcony terrace with 2 chaise, 2 chairs and a table.  The room itself was European typically small with very comfortable bed and bathroom with stand up shower.  There is also a beautiful outdoor seating area around the tropical style entrance and 24 hour bar service.  The Continental breakfast was nice with pastries, bread, coffee and juice.  Best of all, the staff were great and understood our Georgia English.  And a bonus, the husband and wife owners were staffing the front desk our final morning.  They are from a family of vintners and serve their estate wines in the hotel.  Next time we will visit the winery for the Hotel de Provence VIP tour.  We feel lucky to have found Hotel de Provence.  Au revoir.",5
560,"Let's start with the positives. The pool is lovely, and the design and architecture of the resort are good. The rooms are comfortable and the shower was awesome. That's about it. Forget the ' & Spa' but because it's not ready for three months. Therefore it's a hotel. The food is just terrible, at least in terms of resort standard. The service, considering the staff outnumbered the guests, was also poor. There is nothing to do there except swim, avoid the storm force winds that come off the sea, and eat. The internet was also terrible and lasted about an hour. To add insult to injury, the stay and meals/drinks are not cheap. There must be better value in the area and somewhere that has some soul and atmosphere. Staying at Sonata is like visiting a distant relative on the way to somewhere else; you're grateful to put your feet up but you know they are terrible cooks and you can't wait to hit the road again.…",2
561,I will not stay here again.  So disappointed and can not believe this property is connected to Marriott.  Thank goodness we were only there to sleep and change.  Hotel is like a dungeon.  CLOSET door to bathroom is very inconvenient if you are with someone else in the room.  Lobby very loud.  Worst bloody mary I've ever had.  Hospitality was never seen except for one person that made a copy for us.  No one seemed to care how your stay was and even used your name.  Rather expensive too for what we had.  I DO travel a lot so I do know what good service and properties are.  I'd heard so much about the W's and wanted to try one and I am in shock!   I know next visit.,1

The airport pickup was a nice feature, the hotel was in a good location, had hospitable staff and the room clean (except for an awful odor coming up from the toilet), but given the amount I paid, I would have expected a room view of the the volcano when I open my windows/door and a good pool.  If you've never been before you might love it (and don't know better), but if you've been you know, the pools are one of the biggest attractions there, going to the beach is problematic so lounging at the pool is a nice feature.

Step off the Metro and it's five minutes to your room.  Bus #96 stops five minutes away...takes you to the center of the tourist area (St. Michel/Notre Dame).

The room was a lot smaller than I was expecting but still it was nice, clean and comfortable. Only issue we had was that they requested a credit card at checkin which we didn't have so we had to give a cash payment that we would receive back at checkout. They initially asked for €100 but this was not ideal as we only came for 2/3 days so didn't have a great amount of cash with us. They settled for €50 in the end. On checkout they made us wait until the housekeeper checked our room's mini bar and then they gave our €50 back. All in all our stay was a positive one and I would recommend it based on the location.

We stayed for 4 nights and it felt very cramped for this length of time. On the upside the hotel had a decent gym a washer and dryer which was awesome and cool bar and restaurant. The bed was good and bathroom was nice. The location was also really good, nice balance between areas, borderline perfect. Overall mixed feelings.",3

They don't check for ID, room key, etc to make sure you are a guest. I know this because I did it a dozen times during my stay and no one even looked in my direction. Now, I ordered a pizza from one of Chicago's finest for delivery to my room. Front desk calls and tells me the pizza is here. Ok, send it on up I tell them. ""I'm sorry, we can't do that, you see it is a matter of guest safety"". Wait what?

This is the worst customer service I've ever had with any hotel - I didn't get any call/text/email ahead of time.

We stayed half board and the food was fairly basic with little choice both at breakfast and dinner.

I was travelling for business and didn’t need to sit through all that. Beyond that, the worst part, two staff walked into my room to collect bags even though I asked not to, and said don’t come in.

The rooms are large, great views, clean and our room had ample furnishings with a mini bar, TV., King size bed, desk and casual chairs and table. Plenty of hanging space, drawers and a mini safe. The bathroom is dated but has a bidet, over bath shower and is quite large. Toiletries are provided but basic. The Spa, located on premise provide a range of services from scrubs to massages and priced reasonably. The Spa sauna and steam room appear newly renovated. The pool and hot pool also appear to be newly renovated. Additional costs apply to use the facilities although they are part of the property. This hotel will be great when the renovations…",3
614,"I loved this hotel. Staff was incredible, and the room was fabulous. I particularly enjoyed the outdoor bath tub.   The pool has a wonderful view and is a good temperature but the bar was closed when I was there. Drinks and towels are just a quick phone call away though.   Hotel Bagues is situated in the middle of everything. Great in house restaurant, but there are so many places to walk to just a stones throw away. Check out the market up the street and go hungry!  The only downside is that it's a little noisy on the street at night. We sat out on our patio and watched the gypsies pose as prostitutes and pickpocket numerous people. Also there was a strange knock at our door around 3 am and we had to cal the front desk to handle it.   Other than those minor things, this is…",4
615,"The hotel is oversized for its facilities. If full you have to wait to have breakfast, and you cant get a spot at the pool. Its plus, the location.  The concierge service offered is non existent, very lousy.  No taxis at the lobby, you are on your own. The beds are not what u expect from a 5 star hotel. Im not returning for its price, they should drop a star.  ",2
616,"The service was very friendly and profesional. The room was very clean and had all the amenities I needed. There is a supermarket next door, very convenient. We where 2 people and the bed was enough for both of us. The pillows could have been better. Wi-fi was fast but it had no security.",5

The views are beautiful, the staff is very helpful, the pool is nice and breakfast is very good.  Be prepared for lots of steep steps and a bathroom that is not the same as in the US.  Lighting in the bathroom ls almost non-existent and  hair dryers are best left alone.  Its about a 10 minute walk into town so the location is excellent.",3

Went to breakfast , people were waiting for plates as there were no fresh plates or glasses to eat or Drink. There was no clean table to sit . Then I asked for laundry service , Laundry is closed on sundays . I asked for an iron and board to do my own ironing but this hotel does not have a domestic Iron . Even in a 2 star hotel , they would offer you an iron . This hotel is surely not for Business travellers and I think its good only for tourists who needs a room only as food choices were horrible too.",2
619,"Wow ~ I make an excellent choice for our Honeymoon!  First of all, we arrived at 6:30am; international flights are brutal. In hindsight we should have booked the night before so we could go right to our room. Of course, there weren't any rooms ready that early. We left our luggage with the clerk and walked around the neighborhood for awhile. We were so tired that we went back to the hotel after breakfast and a little exploring. They offered us coffee and tea and let us stay in the lounge while we waited. We fell asleep several times and they kept checking on us to let us know the status of our room. They got us in our room around 2:00pm which was 2 hours before normal check-in time. So accommodating. The room was so cute & we couldn't have had a better stay! We opted to stay in…",5
620,Stayed for close to a week at the Sagrada Familia suites and couldn't be more pleased with opting for an apartment for a vacation stay. The comfort and luxury of your home in a new city feels great. Plus the daily free breakfast and helpful staff makes you want to stay longer. We booked a 2 bedrooms and 1 bath and got upgraded to 2bedrooms and 2 bath and it was just perfect. Just a tiny lil issue we faced was a creaky bedroom door which I'm sure can be easily fixed. Otherwise A+ ! Can't wait to explore new properties around the globe,4

They seem to have difficulty in catering for coach parties & give times that you must be down for breakfast, so that they can deal with one party at a time.Breakfast was a shambles, as they ran out of things & didn't replace them until the next coach party, so just bread rolls one day! The toaster is so slow that you need to plan at least 15 minutes before you want it. The electic kept going off & they had to keep putting the trip switch down.",3

The windows had apparently not been cleaned in a while, so the world outside was always in a fog when in fact the weather was sunny. Breakfast had a wide selection of products which were all of decent quality. The booking experience was unfortunately very bumby, short version is that after a room cancellation the hotel was unwilling to refund the room fee based on my rate terms. However the hotel refused to even reinstate my booking. It took me several email exchanges over the weekend to convince the service team to reinstate my booking at no extra charge and only received final confirmation one hour prior to landing in Lisabon.

I was claustrophobic in this dark room and really needed a different room, hard to do here in the busy season! I really tried to accept it, but eventually asked at the desk what to do.

Being proactive in the service, anticipating, running smoothly the communication between members of your team.  If there is a heating issue in the bedroom (Stockholm minus 1 degree): bringing a portable heating is a good idea, but changing client’s room would have been the least to do. Then telling clients at the check-out that clients should have asked to change of room is a lazy service.  Doing a free room service, so clients feel less like in a hostel bringing a tea upstairs...  During the check-in: making sure the hours for breakfast are rightly communicated as breakfast opening hours change on weekend/weekdays: would have avoided disappointment and waste of…",3
630,Stayed for two nights. Hotel is close to the airport but no so close to the center. It is an OK hotel for short or overnight stay. OK breakfast. If you get a room on the train station side you trains will wake you in the morning as the windows do not provide sufficient sound isolation.,3

There are many useful faqcilities in the room.  I didn't know about the possibility to visit sauna and gym in the neighbour hotel when I booked my accommodation. So I was positively surprised to learn this information.  I give 4 points from 5 because there are 2 items that should be changed ASAP to my mind. 1 there is no conditioner. 2 there are standard old keys which you should rest at the reseprion. There were 2 times situations when there was nobody at the reception and I had to wait to take my key...,4

After that, you have to find your building by yourself because the hotel has many buildings in the french village. Our room was in the far back building with absolutely no view and there is no information about that on website. Asked reception if we can change the room and she said it’s fully booked. However, I received a call around 8pm that there is a better view room if we want to move with additional charge. I mean, what would we want to see at 8pm?

Breakfast is served in an immense hall with a very bad acoustic. You cannot hear the people sitting at your own table. Breakfast is basic and the scrambled eggs have no taste.

The place is old but that's it's character, eg ancient lift, high ceilings, creaky floorboards etc the rooms are a great size, my bathroom was excellent and included three showers, the breakfasts are good and include varied choices and its in a good area.

At check-in the staff will provide you with a card having an exhaustive list of all the Astotel sites in Paris, which are conveniently located by many major sites. The card will allow you to have entry for snacks, drinks, or the restroom at any of their locations. That in and of itself is a great perk in France. My room faced a courtyard. It was very quiet and relaxing. The staff at Monterosa, however, was what really made this hotel stand out. At every turn, they went above and beyond to make my stay enjoyable. ",5

The breakfast buffet has lost all muffins, flavoured bagels, English muffins, waffles and fresh fruit (all of which used to be there).

The lady who clean our rooms for three days in a row didn’t replace the tissue paper that we had to call to ask for more. She didn’t come during the day when we weren’t in the rooms. And whenever we are in the room she would annoy you to come and clean.  Also it’s really noisy. We couldn’t sleep at night. And the hotel has no control on the noisy customers.

I didn’t get a call either way and then to make matters worse when we checked in they informed us our room wasn’t ready even at 4pm and instead said “maybe by 515” it would be ready.

Plus points - the staff were pleasant and helpful and there is a lovely rooftop bar. Sadly the rest is downhill.  Situation is not that great and very difficult if you have mobility issues. There is however a great restaurant - Pedro e o Lobo - across the road. My heart sank when I saw the room. Dark and claustrophobic even with the high ceilings. Horrid taupe/ beige paintwork that has not weathered well and fairly spartan shower room. See the photos attached. Bed had a plastic sheet on the mattress that was unpleasant to sleep on.  We had to pay 2.50 euros each for a ghastly swim cap to use the shower and what a disappointment when we got down…",3
676,"We came in June to see Coldplay in Berlin, and experience the city for the first time. Our first impression of the hotel was when we just arrived from the airport, received a warm welcome with hot towels and a drink. Check in took 2 minutes and we loved it instantaneously. The hotel is hip, cozy and comfortable. The room on the 6th floor had a beautiful rooftop view and the room was clean, spacey and very indulging. The Candy Bar in the lobby was so awesome! Service was sometimes less than warm, but overall we loved every minute. Greatest attribute: location. We couldn't ask for a better one, next to the U8 train, in the center of everything.",5
677,"As a client from many years, I only can confirm that the Paris Louvre Opéra is my home in Paris. The location and the people of this hotel are the best quality card to convince to choose it. Clean and comfort follow.",5
678,I don't usually write reviews but this was so bad I really feel I have to warn you. This is a super rundown building that seems to have dorms on some of the floors and rental rooms on some of the others. There is no maid service and you have to take out your own trash. We were promised a room with three beds and there were only two. When we asked about a third bed they came up and made the living room couch which was a very uncomfortable leather thing. When we tried to check out there was no one at the desk. When we called the number we were told someone would be right down. We waited 40 minutes and no one ever came. DO NOT STAY HERE.,1
679,"Clean, comfortable, well located,modern hotel. Easy to access city by walking, public transport, Uber taxi. Think we may have been upgraded as after booking a double room we were allotted a lovely, large suite for our three night stay.  Bed could have been a bit comfier and various tea bags on offer did not include English Breakfast tea (!!) but that's the minor stuff.   A good place to stay on moderate budget.",4
680,"The hotel has an excellent location, staff is very friendly and helpful, room is clean, especially the bathroom. Breakfast is fine! Small comments are the soft pillows and the carpet in the room. Of course it is hard to keep that clean. We stayer here for business reasons and the stay was very good. I would recommend this hotel for both business and leisure stays! ",4
681,"Overall the hotel is quite good. It's near the center, the breakfast is ok, the rooms are good. The stuff is really slow - we occasionally locked our safe box and couldn't open it back, i asked three times (one time in person) to send somebody to help us - reception kept saying that they will send somebody, but nobody came.   BUT. There is real problem with water, i mean bath, douche, toilet - we hadn't problems with them only for a couple of days. Later during all our stay we DIDN'T HAVE HOT water or HAD NO water at all. I asked reception couple of times but all they could say was that they have some works going on and that they will fix it. That was really disappointing.",2
682,"My first room was so noisy that, even though it was noon, with all common daytime noises, I realized I'd have a hard time trying to sleep. My second room had a pronounced smoke stink from previous smoking guests - I believe! Not only that: the drywall in the bathroom was peeling off and the shower door was broken open - one might picture the wet mess the floor was after my shower...  Definitely the worst business hotel I have ever been a guest at. And I'm sure this is just lack of effort, since I've stayed in other Windsor-chain hotels in Rio and all of them kick this one's behind momentously. After I leave, I'll do my best to forget it for good!",2

684,It's a very nice-different hotel in the real heart of the city! It is 1 minute walking from metro station Diagonal from where you can go wherever you want! It is very clean with nice amenities. I suggest the Superior suite which is big and comfortable. ,4
685,"There is not much to rave about this hotel.  The rooms are ok but nothing to rave about.  There is just enough amenities to make it acceptable as a business hotel but nothing more.  Service is horrible when asked over the phone (asked for electric tea kettle four times over span of 1.5 days to finally get one).  There is no wifi except in the rooms where you have to pay 12 USD for 24 hour access.  The channels are limited, toilets are damp...nothing to rave about at all. would not choose this hotel if i had the choice for my next visit.",2
686,"We spent one night here after a trip to Iguazu Falls. The hotel is in the middle of nowhere, which would be all right if it had more amenities. We were tired, so we took a swim in their pool, which needs a thorough cleaning. The room is large with a huge bed. Both the shower and bathroom sink leak water everywhere after use. The hotel is quiet, however, the disadvantage is that unless you take a cab into the town, you are stuck there. We decided to have dinner in their restaurant. A huge mistake. The pasta was overcooked and the sauce was watery and tasteless,the salad was also very bland. The worst thing was that it was grossly overpriced.",2
687,"One set of continuous issues after another, the majority of which relate to the staff running operations behind the front desk.  I tried to check in before the official time and wasn't allowed to, which is completely understandable. What's not understandable is said staff member telling me that there's a $10 charge to hold my bags. That's #1.  After a couple of hours of eating burritos around Mission District, I came back and checked in. The staff member checked me into my room, and tried to get me to pay an additional $15 cleaning fee on top of what I already paid for through a third-party booking site. Uhh no, and that's #2.  (UPDATE 12/7-- the motel still charged me the $15 that I did not consent to pay.  I ended up calling my credit card company and having the charge removed…",1
688,"Stayed here with my elderly mum for a couple of days to see Berlin..  This hotel is in a great location and for transport links- (bus stops and taxi rank right outside the hotel). The exterior doesnt look very impressive ... and the reception area is quite dated but although quite basic it is comfortable with tables and armchairs and coffee machine ( 1euro cost). The reception staff were very nice and extremely helpful  (they speak excellent English--much better than my very basic German)  We had a room of the 5th floor with large windows ---it had fantastic views although the blackout curtains could do with replacing as they were stained with a couple of rips--not obvious unless you close them over.     The bathroom was reasonable modern, a good size, clean with a good shower…",4
689,"We had booked this place in advance because of it's great reviews but unfortunately we found out the hard way that the hotel was not at all what was written.  The location is good but the place is dated (the entrance smelled terribly), the rooms unclean - corners of the floor dusty and details broken or scrappy. The service was not good either, the staff on the rude side and concierge did not help us at all.  They twice sent us in the wrong direction.  Breakfast staff was rude and did not help at all.  We decided to leave even if we had prepaid the whole stay, they did not care at all.",2
690,"Just spent 5 nights at this courtyard and was very disappointed overall. The hotel is very dated and shabby. The room was clean but bathroom had grotty tiles and the shower head was leaking- such an easy and cheap thing to fix. My main complaints are the AC that simply does nothing but blow warmish air. The room temperature did not drop below 26C and that’s with me setting the temp to 16C on the room control. Even in November the room was hot, I dread to think what it would be like in the summer months. You could open the window but the road outside is very noisy day and night. Brought the AC problem to reception’s attention but they could not do anything to fix it. I am guessing the AC system is as old as the hotel. The other problem is the smoking. The hotel is plastered with the signs “no smoking” but clearly no one takes any notice of those. It STINKS of old smoke on upper floors and it stank in my room daily as whenever AC was on, the smoke smell was clearly coming out of it. Great if you are smoker, not so great if you don’t like tobacco smell. Reception do not speak great English. Breakfast was alright but same every day. Not so great when there was a large group of people one morning though, there was literally no food left in the counters. The staff worked hard to clear up but simply could not cope. Bad planning on management side. The executive lounge is not great. Drinks choice is poor, food mediocre. So overall I would avoid…",2
691,"They do not live up to a Westin, I booked them with the understanding they were good on their word, I was told they refuse to honor their word, pretty sad. I can recommend several other hotels in San Francisco that will honor their word",1
692,"A beautiful, classic, old hotel property convenient to many tourist sites, but we found ourselves hiking up hill every night for dinner (think Mt Everest).  Next time we would stay up the hill in the Chiado or Bairro Alto neighborhoods where most of the restaurants we selected were located.  Chiado also has great shopping. Service at Hotel Avenida Palace was good, with the younger employees clearly showing a more welcoming attitude.  The hotel has an excellent breakfast served in a beautiful room and a cozy bar.  Our room was very quiet even though we were on the 2nd floor on a main street.  Durning our visit, in spite of no rain for weeks, there was a significant leak on the main staircase causing them to keep towels folded on each step during our entire 3-day stay.",3
693,"We stayed in this hotel for 6 days. Staff is very friendly, our room was enough big for two and what's most important, it was clean. Breakfast was also very nice, everything was freshly made and delicious. They also have a little gym, if you want to have a workout. Hotel is quite near tram station, which leads to underground station, you are in center of Berlin in 30 minutes. I would recommend this hotel to everyone who plans trip in Berlin. We don't have any complains at all.",5
694,"1st night stay here, already complained about bad bed and door that could not be locked. Was at the pool side bar and there was some repair works at the lobby, not far away. Dust was everywhere. Quite disappointed as this was supposed to be a 5 star hotel. ",2

696,"We spent a lot of time researching on TA and finally chose this hotel for our honeymoon.  We spent 2 nights there but the level of service and quality of the hotel fell short of our expectation.  First was the location. It was a bit far from Fira. We had a rental car so no trouble driving into town but if you are looking to walk to Fira, this hotel would not work. There is the shuttle bus but then you are constrained with time.  We booked the honeymoon suite (private pool).  The room was spacious but our ""private pool"" was right under the hotel's main pool so it wasn't so private since any guests using the main pool can just look down and see our balcony/pool.  Furthermore, our pool shares with the pool next door with a divider in between.  It would be a bit awkward to hang out…",3
697,"Despite what the description says no one here speaks English whatsoever. In the 4 days I was here the only way I could get anything across was when they fetched a young person to help out. The check in and check out was horrible. No hello, no thank you, no helping me find anything. The lady raced ahead up the stairs and I almost didn't see where she went. She opened my room and raced off. With all the other amazing places I have stayed this one was disappointing. Location is not bad as it's quiet. Bike rental for 22,000 d a day so that is nice. The rooms are comfortable and a good value to have some time in your own room. I certainly did not feel welcomed here. I would urge travelers to seek out other accommodations. ",2
698,"The hotel itself is lovely: the rooms are luxurious and clean, beds comfy etc. The pool area is nice enough, it’s a little small but there’s never anyone there so that’s not an issue. The location is great, we walked everywhere from the hotel but also passed many stations on our travels.   The major negative for the hotel which brings it down massively is that the concierge/ reception staff are quite rude. Never did they once look up from what they were doing to say hello or good morning/ evening when we left or entered the hotel. We would always look at them to smile or say hello but they would never respond, if they did look up they would not smile.   On one occasion we asked if they had an hdmi cable that we could borrow (a simple enough request so that we could plug our…",3

It's so annoying and front office just suggested earplug! After spending over $200 per night... It's a disaster here! When we were booking, there was no hints of massive renovation and constructions.. Construction workers talking loudly every day morning and throughout the day... Walls are thin and you can hear lots of noise... Housekeeping staff has got poor English and hard to communicate. They came into my room after one unanswered knocking of my room door at 9am... No apology!!! This hotel doesn't worth the price... Stay away... I cannot wait to check out on Sunday.",1

Unfortunately we did not have that experience here...and we never even spent the night. When I called to make reservations, I was put on hold. However the agent made an error and I could hear her talking about her ""f-ing tracker"" before disconnecting me. I then had to call back to complete the reservation. I did report this behavior to a customer service supervisor as well. When I made the reservation, I prepaid for an extra discount. This is normally non-refundable. However a major winter storm is expected, and so I called the hotel two days later to explain the situation and ask if they could refund the money. I was told…",1

The beds are exceptionally comfortable and nice Ritual toiletries.  However what sadly spoilt it a bit for me and my daughter were the number of little irritations that could so easily be corrected.  On their own not a problem but when put together made us quite disappointed bearing in mind this is a 5* hotel and so it is not unreasonable to expect excellence......  On arrival I would expect to be taken to my room, shown how everything works and my luggage to arrive shortly by porter.  Not here, I was given my room key, directed to the lifts and as an afterthought as I walked away from the reception desk asked if I needed…",3

Pros:  good location, comfortable bedding, 2-3 blocks from Rato metro but 3 flights of stairs to negotiate at the station and another flight at the connecting station to reach the airport.   Cons.  A/C was not operational for the entire hotel on a warm day in April probably  80 degrees in the room at night and windows open less than an inch because of a wire lock.  No hand or face towels, and no clothes line in the shower area (no tub).  Rooms are small with very little closet space and storage space.  Can’t recommend.   ",3

For the first time I decided to book it at the reception they told me the price was 159$ for the night.   The next morning I see a charge of 229$ on my credit card I double check at the reception and they confirm that it is just a pending transaction so it will just charge the final amount of 159$.  A week later the transaction of 229$ went through so I called the hotel several time no answer. After several attempt I finally get to talk to someone and they say that there is about 70$ of fees and tax.   I ask to talk to the manager they say that he will call me back he obviously never did.   I never wrote bad reviews but this was such a bad experience that I had to…,1
707,"Stayed here for business and in town often. Although the property is OK and my general stay was fine, I had to leave a day early. The hotel refused to waive the $50 early checkout fee even though I alerted them the day before and checked out by 9:30 the next day. Front desk staff was not helpful and even the hotel manager was not willing at all to help. I will not be returning. ",1
708,"The location is really hard to beat - close to many Berlin's attractions with the underground nearby. The rooms are clean and there's everything you'd expect from a good 4-star hotel at this price range, with complimentary beer in the minibar as a nice touch. The staff's ok but I agree with what I've read here before - they could use a smile and maybe show a bit more concern. Breakfast was very good, though the breakfast room is a bit crammed.",4
709,"People were very friendly, but that and the location were the only nice things there. The place was old, and decor was quite odd and dark. The bedroom we stayed was for a couple with a suite. If you can call that a suite. The matress or the bed were extremely noisy, every time we moved it made loud noise. We were there in the winter and we had to buy slippers cause the room and the floor were very, very cold.  Breakfast was not served in the hostel, but in a bar near by.   There is no elevator so you'll have to carry your luggage upstairs.   There isn't many places to hang out with other guests. No lounges. Very small place.  I much more prefer the Gallery Hostel.",3

It was exceptional! Most significantly, the staff. They were exceedingly friendly and accommodating. They all spoke English, which was comforting given that my French language comprehension is mediocre at best. This put me at ease immediately. Aside from that, the hotel is very nice and in a great spot, right at the foot of the steps leading up to Sacre Coeur, which offers beautiful views of the City. It is also easily accessible to many of the metro stations, making staying outside the City-proper still convenient. In my travel experiences, a hotel can make or break a trip.

The location is perfect as it is not far to walk to the van Gogh, Rijks Museum, Stedelijk Museum, and the Concertgebouw.  The positives were that there was a fridge, tea and coffee facilities, ice machine on the floor, washing machine and gym downstairs and that you can open the windows to let in fresh air.

Looking to relax before the flight went to floor three to check out health spa and treatments available. Was greeted at the reception desk by two blokes with nudge nudge wink wink looks. Accepted the offer to look at the jacusi and steam room as concerned how they would take a no. So jacussi empty and pair of yellow rubber gloves on the rim waiting for ???!!! Not a good impression.

I am disgraced that out of my 3 week honeymoon both holiday inns one in Washington and the one now in fishermans wharf have charged a ridiculous amount of money to self park our car. This is our last stop until we head home and it has definitely put a dampener on our honeymoon. There are plenty of other places we could of stayed. We saved every cent we had for this trip and $300 to park our car was definitely not in the budget.,1

They also don't have any mini refrigerators, no microwaves and the showers are dingy. The water pressure in the shower was crappy. The valet service isn't worth it if you don't tip them. As I left he didn't even assist with my bags. I could've received better service at a motel 6. This was the worst hotel experience I have ever fathomed. This hotel is too much for piss poor service.

The location was great, being right near the Van Gogh museum and a number of other attractions.",3

736,"I was in Chicago for a medical conference at the end of November. Bought a Macbook on Ebay and asked for the delivery to be at the hotel. Had already spoken via email to Tyrell Brown, who assured me there was no problems in receiving the package before my arrival. When I got at the hotel, there was no package waiting for me! The hotel staff said there were no deliveries for me and that I had to look for it with USPS. I went to USPS and they told me the package had been delivered. Then, I spent the next 5 days talking to the hotel staff and they never seemed to care about my problem, always just saying to me that “it was not delivered” or “check at USPS”!!!! When I left, on the 29th, I finally received from USPS via email the proof that the package had been delivered and signed…",1
737,"We stayed in Hotel Zoe for 3 nights, the staff were great and very helpful. The hotel is quite new and part of Amanogroup of hotels, ideally located for access to the train system (if there are 4/5 you need to buy a daily travel card which are priced at Euros 17.00 great value but you must travel together). The room was quite small but good for a short break, breakfast was also very good. There is a bar call GT Bar open to the public and guests, the downside is it allows people to smoke and that is not good as there is little air conditioning and a real irritation, they should ban smoking. Loads of restaurants near by so your biggest problem is were to eat. ",4
738,"I have wanted to visit this hotel for many, many years.  Given I was solo attending an event in the city, I decided to stay here instead of driving or dealing with a ride share at a late hour.  What a mistake.  What a waste of money.  What a horrible experience.  As many other reviewers have stated, no notification was given about the extremely limited services available and YET PRICES REMAINED THE SAME.  How is this OK?  No room service, very limited hours for the restaurant, ridiculously LOUD and constant noise meaning no sleeping, and dirty, smelly rooms but the hotel charges full price?   I can only say it was utter disappointment throughout my ""stay"".  I would rather call it ""during my trapped time"" because that more closely describes it.  I wasn't able to eat anything…",1
739,"I have mixed feelings about this hotel. I had to share my experience with my family as it’s an expensive mistake. We wanted to enjoy new year as a family in this hotel. Upon arriving after 2 hours going around in circles to find this hotel, the young guy who was at  the reception on new year’s eve, didn’t even make no eye contact and I don’t even know where to start. We were all very tired and I was mentally exhausted. I thought we would atleast be greeted in a good way. I asked twice as I booked my room and my kids room together and there’s just a door inbetween us, like in your home. The receptionist didn’t even looked at me and even communicate, all he said yes they are next to each other. Assuming that there was a language barrier we thought its the same thing we booked. Anyway I couldn’t even be bothered with him so went upstairs and the rooms were far apart. I mean I’ve never left my kids in another room. We are always together so this wasn’t happening. Husband went downstairs and we got a room which I’ve attached pictures. 4 single beds, freezing cold room, didn’t feel right at all. I mean do you call this a 5 stars. I’ve been to 4 star hotel and I must say i sometimes were asking why were they 4 as they were a different level. Anyway, called housekeeping and this guy was so kind and he did gave me blankets and heater. He was understanding and said he couldn’t do anything other than speak to receptionist. It was still cold the 3 nights spend. This housekeeping staff should have been at the reception and the young guy should be hiding himself. The staffs I don’t know, are they bored!? But only 1 or 2 were actually kind, the rest seemed bored and wanted to get rid. I didn’t dine as the hotel was so close to any shops around. It’s Only 5-10 mins walk. The spa and pool aren’t 5 stars, no lifeguard, after 8pm there’s no staffs. 2nd night the cleaner came to clean, this was so weird, as she ran quickly when I answered. I went to the door she said if we need anything angrily, i said no. But she switched the lights off while we were eating! Later in the night found out facewash gone missing. Again I couldn’t be bothered to go and see the reception. This hotel needs to do a lot of changes and improvements. For me it’s not a 5 star. However would say thank you to the girl who assisted us at the check out time.…",3
740,"Overall I actually liked this hotel.   The rooms were large and comfortable, very clean, and bathrooms were very nice. I received a ""welcome package"" upon checking in which was a nice touch. Staff were friendly. Location is very good, and the lobby is nice.  Only a couple downsides: the room had a musty odor, though I got used to it. My room was on the street side, which was a bit loud at nighttime, though it didn't bother me too much. Strangely, on my second night, I was awoken at 3:30am by a phone call from the front desk staff asking me if I had ordered food to be delivered. I don't know what that was about; frustrating to be woken up in the middle of the night, but I assume this was a fluke.  The reason for my low rating, though, was their pricing policy. Hotel Abri charges…",1
741,Paid for 3 nights but could only stay for 2 as we didn't like the hotel at all. I don't often write a poor review but we found this hotel very unfriendly.  This is our first trip to Vietnam and the three hotels we stayed in previously were staffed by friendly and happy people. Most of the staff here seemed miserable and fed up. This seemed to us to spread to the guests. We always try and smile and nod to other guests as we go about the hotel but this place we got ignored by nearly everyone. There appears to be many Japanese and Russians which may explain this as they have a different culture to us. The hotel is 10k from the main strip and is extreme remote. The beach Is filthy either side of the hotel beach (not obviously the fault of pandanus)  and not at all nice to walk on.…,2
742,"It was our Father-Daughter trip before my oldest daughter left for college. Our room was given away & the room we were given didn't have as good of a view. Plus, our keys didn't work after the first day, which was frustrating after a long day & waiting 15 minutes on the elevator, especially asking to make sure the keys were through our entstaybwhen checking in. One person, Desmond, cared enough to try to make things right.",1
743,"Fabulous hotel. We arrived st 7 pm and told room was not ready so disappointed but this was very soon rectified and upgrade given. Service in hotel was fantastic. Room facilities were high standard, very spacious rooms.  We used the hotel Rolls Royce for a dinner reservation to the Ritz, excellent. Would love to go back.",5
744,"The panoramic rooms with a nice view towards the sea are beautiful, but pay attention to the fact that only from  those that are more expensive you can see the famous Oia's sunset.  The standard rooms are not bad but very small and dark. The mattress are very tough. The breakfast was good and generous. The coffee and the orange juice were terrible. The staff was very kind and helpful.  The cleaning was excellent. It is important to say that there are lots of stairs to do constantly and it is difficult to recommend for people with problems of ambulation. We could recommend this place if you find discounted prices. With normal prices it is overvalued.",3
745,"5 minutes by foot from Museumplein, the location is great if you're on a short trip to visit the likes of the Stedelijk, the Van Gogh and the Rijksmuseum. Price was a little steep for the quality of the room, although to be fair, I did book a little late. Not the worst but definitely not the best either. Also, no Wi-Fi in the rooms.",3
746,"My room was so awful. The hall to our room was truly frightening. The room was musty smelling and the bathtub was old and so nasty looking. They required a 50% deposit at the time of booking which came to $140.00. I’m sure I won’t see that money and I may not see the remaining $140.00, but the room was so bad I took the loss and found another hotel nearby.",1
747,"Big rooms, and with everything you need to be confortable. It's very centric, near check point charlie, cathedral and the island of museums. Very quiet zone and it's worth it if you want to pass some days in Berlin.  I didn't use gym and sauna but they seemed to be good.",5
748,My room was so loud due to the conference below and the bar next door I had to literally use ear plugs . The staff is union and cares zero about satisfaction. It a a major haul from your room to the elevators if you have to carry anything with you for your trip . And the rooms are way over priced fro quality and it’s another a day to park and the valet is non lo stable  stand and rude . It is very close to ferry building . ,1

How I missed a heavenly bed and wished I booked elsewhere. Property is rundown. It’s in a beautiful place; but it is no luxury resort.  2 stars: This includes poor service, value for money, expectation of quality by brand, and subpar service and property management. Property is in disrepair. Letters missing on signs, big orange cones by broken pool tiles and no one fixing them ever. Bed had a huge gash on headboard. No bathrobes in rooms.

751,"First of all the hostel is in a good location. The staff are nice, and the breakfast is good. However, as it's been said in previous reviews I found it hard to socialise with other travellers, maybe it was just the dorm I was in. The lockers for your bag are in a hall outside the room. The washroom facilities were fine if you got there after the cleaners, otherwise it got a bit smelly and dirty etc. There was only one or two plugs in the room which was a slight inconvenience, but there are multiple for use in the bar and reception area.  I wouldn't advise to not stay here as it's not all that bad, but I doubt I would stay here again.",3

Our dinner in the Restaurant took 1.5 hours til we received the one Hamburger we shared and there were only two other tables.  Their reason ""There's a lot of people calling room service"".  I was surprised not one person in the entire restaurant knew what Mayonnaise or Mustard was. I doubt we were the first people to ask for it in the years it's been open, but maybe?  We took a shot at the bar and never got service there either for just a drink. When we went down the next day for lunch they said the restaurant was closed so only the Tour Groups could eat there.  Not sure where they had in mind for us to eat then?  Our two breakfasts tasted like grease.  I also had just come from…",2

The rooms are adequate but quite compact. sufficient if you are alone on business. The room was comfortable and had all the needed equipment including a coffee/tea machine, and a minibar. A wifi as well as a wire network connection are available (the wire connection does not require login and is faster).",4

756,"I stayed at the Novotel Sao Paulo Jaragua twice in the space of a week.  The best things about this hotel are the central location, the breakfast, and the recently refurbished fitness centre.  The worst things are the meagre amenities and abysmal check in and check-out experience.    This Novotel is well below the standard I have experienced at other 4 star hotels and other Novotels. I stayed in two different rooms which were both feeling tired with worn furnishing and musty stale air. For the first stay I booked a Superior room and for the second stay I stayed in an Executive Room (although this room stunk of cigarettes even though it was a non-smoking room). Neither room contained a kettle or coffee machine and room amenities were at an absolute minimum.  The most…",2
757,"If you see my usual reviews, I try to be positive about things. But this time, this is unfair. We have half the service, half the menu, half the peace and half the experience but we have to pay the full fare. Telling guests upon arrival that you have a strike, it’s not the best way to address the issue. Telling that improvements will not affect our stay, but having a chipping hammer at 9 am, it’s very annoying. We know that things may go wrong, but we also have to learn how to deal with them. I will be loyal, but this review intends to improve response in crisis.",1
758,"Absolutely loved this hotel. The interior is as grand as it’s name suggests. We had a lovely family room on the 5th floor where we had some fantastic views of Berlin. The room was very clean, bed comfortable and shower very good. Good was good in the hotel with good selection for breakfast including a glass of bubbly. My only criticism would be the bar menu was quite limited. If you are staying more than a couple of nights you will need to find somewhere else to eat. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful. Particularly the concierge who helped us sort out our missing bus tickets. Would have given the hotel a 5 if the menu had been a bit more exciting. Highly recommend however. ",4
759,"Very friendly and helpful staff, happy to help which is rarer and rarer these days.  Great location for the metro, the ""Arch,"" and affordable yet good restaurants.  Clean rooms, very quiet, and staff gave us fabulous local information that really improved our stay and Paris experience.",5

761,"Helpful and nice staff, great location, amazing view, clean, hot eater, great sleep, modern rooms, no complains ! Just the breakfast it's a little over priced, 20 euro for a breakfast , when around the corner in front of the train station you can find a great great breakfast for 5 euro. That's my only negative, everything else was very very good.",4
762,"The Hotel is situated in a quiet, yet very central, area - with Louvre and Norte Dame within walking distance - not far from the river.  The hotel employees were extraordinary service-minded and welcoming, and the hotel standard was really good. It is a good-feeling hotel, with a nice atmosphere.   We’ll probably choose the same hotel next stay in Paris.",5

Ended up having to park in a garage and then pay to have the car taken out and finally valeted. Room unimpressive and completely reeked of cigarettes. Bathroom extremely small and in need of some serious tlc. Typically I wouldn't mind an outdated room/hotel if the treatment of the staff can make up for it, but we were very disappointed by the front desk staff - not helpful and rude. Actually stayed at the Cartwight Hotel in Union Square earlier in the week and would 100x recommend that, though in need of a facelift, over Clift as the staff were some of the most kind and helpful people I've ever encountered.  Would never recommend or stay here again.…",1

765,"Never judge a book by its cover, which is exactly what we did when looking at The Monarch hotel in Geary Street’s website and instantly regretted it. Our stay at this establishment has got to have been THE worst experience of our lives!   Where else can you find a hotel where you must put your hand down the toilet bowl to help it flush? Where else does the heating have strange dust like substances come flying airborne out of the vent, which is quickly followed by a smell of burning? Where else does the room safe not have a key, the lights buzz when you turn on a switch, the bathroom door require lifting to avoid the noisy scraping on the ground, and a shower tap with just one temperature that’s so hot it burns your skin - and in my personal opinion - is dangerous?   I could also go on to say the room is dated, the curtains are wipe down plastic, the carpet has certainly seen better days, the paintwork is tarnished and our room was so cold we feel we would probably have been warmer if we slept on the roof outside!   When a complaint was made at reception, we were told that there was nothing they could do, and we would have to speak with the management who wasn’t there at the time. This we have now done - twice - and are still currently awaiting on a reply.   Originally, we were booked to stay for a week but left after one night, and for this privilege, we were charged over $570 plus tax. Our total bill for this horrendous and pitiful experience came to $671.05  I will never recommend this establishment to anyone. Ever!…",1

At check in- they took one half of the group, signed them in and sent them up, and only then told us the second room was not available and the other half of the group was to be shipped across town. The excuse offhandedly offered was that they experienced lots of bookings the previous week.  That is unacceptable as our rooms were prepaid and no notice was given via email or phone of their intent not to honor our reservations.  Desk staff passive aggressive. Substitute hotel dated, two beds not one, and terribly inconvenient as we now have to travel back across town to meet up with our group in the AM,. Never again- ever.",1

769,"Asked for a cup of coffee from night reception and told to get one from the machine in my room. He also said I could walk to the casino if they were still open. Simply not good enough. The hotel is poorly laid out, rooms very small, Sky bar is incredibly overpriced. Although all day reception staff very helpful . I will not be returning.",3

Room was very basic, no special furniture, old TV, bathroom was in almost decent conditions. Favela view not expected which made it pretty noisy! Location: positive is the fact that you're close to Copacabana. However you're not on the seaside but a couple of streets inside so anywhere you have the room, view won't probably be good. Wouldn't recommend to ANYONE to return by foot after dark even though recent security empowerment Rio provided to the city. For this kind of hotel I wouldn't have expected to pay more than 70-80€ (already pricey, but considering it's Rio...) Didn't have the opportunity to test service level and additional features (e.g. restaurants etc...)",2
774,Mum and I visited 9 November for 3 nights. We wanted somewhere cheap but decent and close to sightseeing spots.  It's exactly what we got. Our room was on the 4th floor. It had 2 single beds and sn ensuite bathroom. The room looked like a travel lodge room. We had a flat screen TV.  Beds were comfy with clean sheets and fresh towels daily.  We didn't hear any noise at night time for it being a hotel/hostel.  It was pretty busy so I was pleasantly surprised.   Breakfast was a cold buffet but it done the trick. We left after breakfast and spent all day out and about not coming home to bedtime so the accommodation was fine.  Looking at other reviews we must of got a good room.   We were happy with our stay and I would recommend if u only need a place as a base to explore. ,3
775,"The hotel is in an excellent location. Modern and with good facilities. Room whilst stylish, a duplex, and well equipped was dark and a bit  dingy. Bed and pillow was uncomfortable.

No-one offered to help us with our bags, in fact they didn't even help to hold the door open for me as they watched me struggle to hold the door open at the same time as pushing a luggage trolley through the door.  Not a great start.  We were pleasantly surprised by the accommodation itself, however very quickly realised there was no air-conditioning and the only way to get fresh air was to open the windows.  However with there being no screens/rails on the windows this was not an option as we were on the 3rd floor and the windows were all quite low.

Throughout our stay the hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and delivered great service,  the hotel is immaculate clean as is the whole island of Madeira to be honest.  The hotel is described as four star but I think this is a little optimistic. The food in the main buffet restaurants was very disappointing.   There are four speciality restaurants which you can only visit each one once in a week stay. The brasserie you can only visit once and in fact you may not get in if you are only there one week as they limit the availability to hotel guests as it’s open as a restaurant too.   We were there for two weeks and visited the brasserie once and that was definitely the bes5 one of all of them.  We visited…",3

The air conditioner in my room (1106) was so noisy I had to turn it off.  Based on what I could see that turned my stomach, previous guests thought it was acceptable to smear the contents of their nostrils on the bathroom tiles.  I am at a loss as to why people would do this, but more concerned why the cleaners would choose to ignore what was very clear to see.  After that I was very careful to make sure everything I needed to use was thoroughly washed, including cups, spoons, glasses, etc.  My room had an internal door through to the adjoining room. This meant that the voices coming from the next room were easily heard in my room.  I would have mentioned…",2

The rooms were old, smelt of cigarette, unclean and you just felt dirty. We changed rooms twice after just checking in. First room was a death trap with exposed wiring on the headboard lamp, my son almost touched and it was a live wire - they changed our room. After only being in the new room a few moments, probably in worse condition (10.30pm) a loud bang at the door woke our baby.. it was a junkie who was let in the building, who had to walk straight past reception trying to enter our room.

There is an awesome bakery directly across the street for your morning coffee and pastry and the Wittnenbergplatz U-bahn station is just around the corner with lines 1, 2 and 3 passing through this station.  Also, this hotel is a short walk from the Zoologischer Garten railway station where you can catch the shuttle bus (X9) for your return to Tegel Airport.  All-in-all, this clean and comfortable hotel is a great value!",4

The location is fabulous but the room had problems:  1) the bathroom fixtures did not work properly with a toilet that didn't flush and a shower assembly that fell off of the wall, 2) noise from the cafe downstairs shook the walls till 3:00 am every night, 3) there were very strong paint and new carpet fumes in the room.  Other reviewers warn of the treacherous stairs but it's Amsterdam so that is expected.  I can't speak to the regular hotel rooms but the apartment we stayed in left a lot to be desired even though it was a good price point for the quality of location.",3
789,My niece and I were looking to have some fun in the city of Chicago. This is an expensive place to stay. I booked a room with 2 beds but when we checked in we had ONE bed. When I questioned this mistake and asked to have the type of room I booked instead I was told the hotel was fully booked and they could not change our room. The room was SO small. there was barely a foot on either side of the bed and the bathroom door was reachable from the bed. several times we bumped our knees on the bed while moving about. The fact that the room was NOT what I booked and they were unwilling to correct the problem makes me give this hotel a double thumbs down.,1

Our 1st holiday to Madeira and while the Island is absolutely stunning and hotel location is amazing it fell short of being the true 5 star hotel we expected.  Negatives: service at breakfast left a lot to be desired, consistently took 30 mins every day to receive poached eggs?!?!   Selection of hot food at buffet was bland, scrambled eggs ‘watery’ We decided to have breakfast in the room to avoid unnecessary delays again with the buffet egg orders. However again another disappointment, toast was forgotten and when I reminded room service, the hotel representative was less than pleasant saying I hadn’t stated if I wanted white or brown bread so they brought neither !…",3
791,Just returned from 3 nights in lisbon Having read all the reviews have to say I was somewhat disappointed in the hotel  Whilst it had a good location and was clean it lacked any Atmosphere the service was pretty bad   Am used to a good morning or a good afternoon when I walk into a small hotel however the staff were indifferent a hospitality training would not go amiss  The rooms were nice and clean we had to change rooms as the first room had no closet at all. Second room was a little better  Overall it is a clean place to stay in a central location but lacks hospitality and atmosphere  ,3
792,We stayed only one night at this hotel. We had much noise from the external ac unit which was on our balcony and in the morning cigarette smoke coming from somewhere. Except for that ok hotel with big breakfast. Nice pool but all sun beds that was in the sun taken early in the morning via the towel trick and it was not allowed to move a chair in the pool area from the parts with no sun to read a book in the sun according to the staff in the pool bar. ,3
793,This is a truly excellent hotel in every aspect. Reception was unfailingly helpful and efficient. We had a spacious room full of light and a large bathroom; the room was equipped for every need. Breakfast offered a very wide choice The boutique-art furnishings added to the pleasure of the stay. The hotel is in easy walking distance of the galleries and museums in Berlin Mitte and the fashion shops a little further on. And the price was very reasonable for a hotel of this quality in a capital city.,5
794,Booked my trip on Priceline. Paid Priceline for my room charges. The W charged me for my room charges as well. Now I have been charged twice for the same room. Front desk said they would not refund. DON'T TRUST THIS HOTEL!!!,1
795,"We were here for 3 nights and 4 days. The services were definitely lacking. We arrived there at around 7pm and had to wait 10 minutes for the receptionist/bartender/waiter to take us to the room. He did not give us any instructions what so ever. They didn’t even offer to clean our room until the 2nd day. When we asked the receptionist regarding a place to visit/touring, he didn’t offer us any package or seem to want to talk to us at all. They took our passport and didn’t give it back until we left. When we went into the unlock office, one of our passport were laying on the table. Overall, bad experience with the staff.",1
796,"Once you manage to get it straight in your head which elevator to take from the reception area located on the second floor to either your room or to the ground level, you will find everything in order. The rooms are of good size, clean and with a most comfortable bed. As with many European hotels, there is a noticeable lack of electrical sockets which means having to, at times, rearrange the furniture to get at one. Beds are large and most comfortable as were the pillows. The bathrooms are of an ample size and the shower, confusing at first, provided plenty of hot water. Breakfast is included and consisted of a good variety of both hot and cold items. Although none of the staff were even the slightest bit rude, they were far from friendly and made little effort whatsoever to…",4
797,"We found the hotel extremely difficult to locate.  The gps did not pick up their address or their name.  We phoned the front desk and she had us going in completely the incorrect direction.  The hotel is not right on the ocean front.  The entrance -lobby- is at the street behind what they claim to be their address...so beware...you may use and hour of your vacation trying to locate this place.  Upon arrival we expected a double bed or at the least, two beds made as one.  This, through numerous requests did not happen.  Our fridge was not working, but the next day they did fix it which was great.  We had a beautiful deck which overlooked everything.  The air conditioning was fine and the room was large in comparison to other European hotels.",3
798,"The room was ok, breakfast really cool (pancakes, muesli, French toasts..)  BUT more cleaning would be appreciated, especially in the bathroom, sometimes it was really horrible to go to toilets.  The bed linen were quite dirty as well. ",3
799,"To start on the positives - the hotel is beautiful and the views are as incredible as pictured - the rooms are also well decorated and the beds comfortable. The view was the main reason for us booking this hotel and we had read a few negative remarks and chosen to ignore them - as you may well also chose to do.  However, I will say that once you are actually there (or even whilst you're trying to find the hotel on the way there in a taxi) you quickly realise that these 'niggles' will negatively impact your overall trip. When our taxi driver did eventually locate the hotel (which is not actually located on the road it claims to be and is not signposted at all from the main road) he seemed extremely concerned that we were staying there and warned us not to step outside the gates…",2
800,"Disappointed because the room I reserved was supposed to have a bathtub, and upon check in, I did not receive what I paid for. Also, order room service for breakfast in the morning and the kitchen got the order wrong so it had to be remade and delivered again. Not the relaxation I was hoping for this weekend. ",2
801,"We stayed one week in this hotel facing the sea. Beautiful view. The room was clean and big. The service is good with smiling and efficient staff. BUT... The quality of the food is really bad whether at breakfast or lunch/dinner buffet: tasteless, industrial. At dinner the entrées buffet has little choice. The buffet restaurant is very noisy with staff cleaning up and manipulating dishes and cuttlery with a lot of noise while you are trying to have a relaxing breakfast! We tried the spa and were very disappointed: the facilities are old and not very well maintained: one of the two jacuzzis was out of order, no steam in the steam room, no possibility to leave your personal belongings in a locker. In a nutshell: good basics but an urgent need to upgrade services to really deserve…",3
802,Overall very happy with this hotel.  Staff was very able and helpful in all respect.  Location is excellent in the center of the old city of Barcelona.  Boutique hotel that is very much worth while visiting. ,4
803,"Blue Tree Hotel in Morumbi was chosen because its location near family. The breakfast was great also the staff were very kind, good served and clean. The rooms were not neat, not well cleaned, bed sheets not good quality as towels too. Bathroom should better cleaned.",2
804,I could not sleep to much noise and when I ask for towels for the pool the cleaning lady could not understand a word I was saying the people in the parking gave me a hard time about unloading my luggage and I'm handicap ,1
805,"ok, so its got an Intercontinental badge on the outside and it carries all the normal Intercontinental stuff but this is no Intercontinental hotel. By far the most tired, most shabby Intercontinental i have ever been in. Having just been in Korea, where it was beautifully appointed, the service was immaculate, and the sophistication was evident here i am in Pudong, Shanghai, and this place is a dump.  Why? Well apart from the things which Intercontinental normally do so well - the details, which here have been covered up cheaply, my room door has been repaired cheaply, there are chips and knocks all over the walls, the bathroom feels dirty, the carpet is stained and the paint in the room is really cheaply done. It is a bit like China as a whole - it looks good from a distance,…",2
806,"Lovely hotel in great location near lots of cool wine bars. Even though the hotel is in the Marais it manages to be out of the noise and bustle. The room was larger than many in Paris and very well appointed. All the staff were friendly, professional and responded to our requests efficiently. There is a pool, sauna and spa that unfortunately we did not have a chance to use. The bar man was very helpful when we stopped in and enjoyed a quiet drink.",5
807,"The hotel was located exactly across the station. Very friendly and helpful staff, Nice room with a view. Clean sheets and nice bed. Many restaurants beside and bus stations located along the main road.",5
808,"We were greeted pleasantly by Andrew upon arrival who advised us that we had been ""upgraded"" to another appartment.  When reaching the room, we found that it had 3 bed-rooms, rather than the two ordered.  The quality of the ""upgraded"" apartment was disappointing for the money paid, as your original confirmation had said One Queen and One Double Bed, whilst we had two doubles.  Also the lounge 3 piece suite was very uncomfortable in the centre, where the springs were coming through, plus the Dining Room table was very shabby.  We were disappointed with the standard but the apartment was comfortable and the staff helpful at all times.  ",2
809,I had a business trip and stayed in this great hotel. They offer massages in the spa area which I would highly recommend. It was so great. This woman has magic hands and I felt light weighted afterwards... like in heaven.,5
810,Stayed in the 3 star apartments for a week in September 2016. Facilities are very good but the beds are like concrete and you have to pay 10 euros reach time you use the gym and indoor pool. Other than that the staff are excellent and the place is spotless. We would not stay here again however.  ,3
811,"This hotel is situated in a very bad neighborhood.  You cannot even go to the nearest parking lot, a block away without walking to dozens of homeless people, occupying the pavement.  This is definitely not a hotel any women on her own should stay, if she would want to leave the hotel, come and go freely, without being scared.  People are also screaming and shouting outside of the hotel during the entire night.",1
812,"My partner and I are a couple of easy going Kiwis. We are backpacking on a budget, but decided to pay a bit more to stay here due to the great reviews.   When we arrived at the hotel, the guy behind the desk did not greet us when we approaches the desk and when he did serve us he was very uninterested and cold. We saw on the form we filled out that we had originally be assigned a room on the 6th floor. It had been crossed out and replaced with a room on the 1st floor. When we questioned why this was the guy became flustered and told us we had been upgraded to a better room on the 1st floor.  Now anybody who knows hotels knows that the better rooms are higher up. We did not appreciate being lied to.   The room had a damp musty smell and had not been aired in a long time. Things…",2
813,"I would not recommend to stay in this hotel because of pathetic staff/manager behavior . At the time of check in we asked for a Microwave and hotel staff told us that we can use in hotel restaurant. Since we are vegetarian, we requested a hotel staff on first night to show us the microwave to warm up the food but he didn't allowed us. Also, it was night and hotel supervisor on duty asked my wife to look outside for some other restaurant to warp up the food. I asked him to speak to his management regarding this inconvenience caused to us and still didn't received any call back from hotel manager next morning. 2nd day i was able to speak to manager in afternoon after multiple follow ups but it made me more upset after talking to him. Rather than understanding customers issues he…",1
814,"We stayed two nights at the hotel and everything was top notch. I emailed the hotel with some requirements prior our arrival and they did everything we asked for and even went the extra mile. The location of the hotel is also very nice, it's close to the main touristic attractions, but equally it feels very local and non-touristy. The rooms are very cosy and clean.",5
815,Not a hotel equal to the reputation Hyatt had precociously earned. No room service. No business center. Not an informed staff as the didn't seem to be aware of new rooms being opened. Overall it is a disappointing Hyatt experience.Will have to re-evaluate my membership.,1
816,We were tricked by the sheer glam of the reception area which has a classic and elegant old French feel. Once we payed for the room (700 USD per night) we were taken to completely different building across the hotel grounds which had no personality. Although it was modern it was not what we bought into and we felt absolutely cheated. The price of the breakfast is way over the top so it's best just to venture into the streets to the local cafés. Beware of the bar too.,2
817,"The hotel is perfect for people that enjoy night life, sitting in cafes and trying new restaurants. The room was clean and good in size. The only thing that was a bit strange was the open bathroom. As we were friends and not a couple in the room, some privacy in the bathroom would have been great.",4
818,"Very tired and depressing hotel. We stayed for 2 nights and although the hotel is in a good location there are no real further positives to say. The bed and mattress were really uncomfortable and clearly not been changed in years, we had a piece of string hanging from the ceiling to turn the lights on, the shower was no more than a dribble and the walls are paper thin. If the rubbish collection doesn’t wake you up at 6am the room service certainly will. Hotel feels like you are in the movie “The Shining”. You would be better staying in a hostel. ",1
819,"The location is wonderful but that's where I run out of positives. They charged me twice for my room and despite both my bank and VISA telling me they can absolutely refund me, they can't be bothered to look into it after me ask about it numerous times in person and proving my point sharing my bank statement with them. The staff didn't follow up as they had promised even when they promised to call back. The room was barely clean when I first got the keys. The bathroom was covered in dust, there were flakes of someone's dry skin on the floor and my friend walked into her room finding a strange man's sock on her hotel room floor!  Don't stay at this hotel if you're looking for any kind of privacy as the walls, floors, ceilings and doors are so paper thin that you will be able to…",1
820,"Wow, is all I can say.  We were a group of 4 adults in town for the Chicago Marathon.  Our room was the size of my childhood closet.  The beds are just a hair bigger than twin size beds and were so ungodly uncomfortable.  We called down to ask for a roll-a-way (I was with my husband but the other two were not a couple and would rather not sleep in same bed) and they told me that since we were in a double room that they could not send one up.    There is a fridge...well, a mini bar and if you pick anything up, it automatically charges your room for the item.  So you can not keep bottles of water or gatorade for your marathon runners in the fridge.  There is a warning sign about the automatic charge BEHIND some of the items.  The warning is not visible unless you pick up organic…",1
821,I have just been to this place while in BCN for MWC. The location on Passeig de Gracia is very convenient as you can easily walk to most of the places of interest. This place is more like serviced apartments than a hotel. My apartment was spacious and quite on the 5th floor. I was not facing the road but on an inside courtyard which was actually very pretty and peaceful to watch. The place was super spacious and comfortable. The people working at reception were always very friendly and extremely helpful. I also had a spacious living room so was able to invite a couple of friends up to a drink.  It was very expensive at 500 euros but given it was during MWC I believe the cost is inevitable. I will be more than happy to return there instead of going to a hotel next time.,4

823,"My husband and I spent 7 nights at Volcano view.   The hotel has a stunning location. The outstanding view makes up 90% of what this hotel has to offer. This is certainly not a 5 star hotel, more like a 3 star.   Food at the hotel is expensive; it is good, but not excellent.   Alternatives are, a bakery across the road that is very reasonably priced. I would certainly recommend getting soft drinks, coffee, water etc from here. They also have a good selection of pastries, sweets and sandwiches.  In addition, there is a small bar/lounge cafe just beyond the bakery ( between the bakery and the Mexican restaurant) that has snacks and drinks at a reasonable price.   The good: -Average rooms, clean with a mini fridge and a safe.  -Most of the rooms on the upper floors have good views.…",3

825,It was a nice hotel. I did not like the front desk contacting me via text about my credit card not working and demanding me to call the front desk to clear it up before I checked in. It was annoying that they couldn’t wait till I provided a card when checking in. Also when they contacted me via text again and I asked them a question. They again told me to call the front desk for the answer. Not a fan of the text system at this property. I have stayed at multiple Hilton properties and I do not enjoy my stay here. It is a nice hotel and friendly staff but not again.    ,1
826,"Good staff, neat & clean rooms. Not modern, but well appointed. I asked for a firmer pillow & one was bought up straight away. Do yourself a favour and pay the 15 EUR to use the steam room/sauna, it was so good. Location is a bit far away from the hip tourist area of Alexanderplatz but was good to wonder around the zoological area of town. There are some cute little restaurants opposite that are well priced with good food & big shopping complexes just around the corner near the zoo.",4
827,"Being a Swede I really have to have a good day in a sauna some times. This hotel had one for use for the guest that could work for me. I booked a suite with in-room wirlpool. Not so much fuss about the room, maybe not so smart to have the bath in the same room as the bed but with aircon on it dryed up during some ours in the sauna in the basement.   The sauna worked OK, but changing cloths and shower is out around the corner so not very relaxing to sit and breath between baths.  Bed in the room are super comfy.

I live near Chicago and I just like to stay downtown whenever we are doing a concert, comedy show, or anything that goes into the later hours.  I have returned to this location so many times because, typically, I had experienced great service at IOC, but the last two stays this all changed in a very negative way.

Access and egress so easy given its proximity to Gare de Lyon, #4 Bus Direct from CDG airport and  metro/RER stations. Rooms are functional, clean and comfortable. Street itself is quiet. Service is great - shout out to Miss Keria at front desk who is particularly helpful and attentive. At current exchange rate with USD, this hotel is particularly a good value.",5
832,"Just back from a 5 night stay at Max Brown Canal District (MBCD). For the price we paid, and from reading numerous reviews, I was expecting a luxury boutique hotel. However, MBCD has all the great ideas, but suffers from not being able to execute them.   Our room, right at the top of the building, was small and cosy, which was lovely. But, it was also two single beds (and linen) not tied together - not what you want for a five night stay with your other half. We were offered a room change to a double, but the other room was really shabby and just off the main reception so we declined. Staff were pleasant throughout this, and we probably should have stated in our booking, but the least you could do was tether the beds! Breakfast was disappointingly spartan - some cheap bread and…",3

Location is a bit of a trek from central Amsterdam, a 10 min bus or taxi journey so bear this in mind when booking",3

I checked in after an over night flight and they gave me a room with two twin beds even though we booked the King Deluxe Room Then when I tried to get the password for wifi it took about 5 different calls to get it done. To their credit they did give me wifi for free for the mix up with the room. My colleague and I had to go straight to a meeting so we were exhausted when we came back to the hotel. Since there's nothing around here as far as places to go and eat we thought we would eat in the hotel. The one and only restaurant in the place that is open for dinner wasn't open til 7pm (this was 6:30) and we were starving. So we thought we would go wait in the bar but it was closed because of a private event. So I went to my room to get room service. My room…,2

836,"Good things first. Rooms really transport you into a different world. And it's nestled in the midst of the charming Oia and you feel like being part of a traditional village of sorts. The view around is beautiful too.  However, the rooms look bigger in pictures; the Jacuzzi too. And it wasn't nearly as well placed as it looked on the site. Service isn't as prompt as you'd like it to be either. One person with too much to do...not his fault really. All in all...not what we had expected.",3

We were lucky to get a top floor room with a fine view of the Paris skyline. The breakfast buffet was extensive and high quality.  A good positioning in Paris with easy access to two Metro lines - we never had to make more than one change of line while moving all over Paris.   Highly recommended!  ",5

My card was charged over $600 because of THEIR mistake, and it took more time than it should have to get a refund. When I finally got the front desk manager, Jenny, to refund me, she admitted that she was only doing it ""because I was nice"" and that usually she just lies and tells people that there's nothing she can do to help.

We said, time and again, how fortunate we were to have chosen this hotel as our base.

Any guest of, might one say, ""ample"" proportions could find this facility an issue. This apart, a lovely hotel with completely professional and courteous staff always on hand. Brilliant breakfast selection including great coffee. Going to Berlin ? Go to California ! Oh.......and the sleep quality......we shall be sourcing the Turkish mattresses for our own beds.",4

He keep insisting is the hotel policy and I had try to prove to him I am a legitimate card holder and even  offer to call the bank to verify but the manager just refuse it and even say to ask me to go another hotel.

On arrival the front desk staff was courteous and efficient. The lobby was well decorated and quiet. We requested a double room on a high floor with a nice view as it was our anniversary trip. When we got to the room we were a bit disappointed as the room was definitely not at the same standard as the lobby or a 4 stars hotel. Decor was all over the place, furnitures werent even the same style or colour and all scratchy. We didnt bother in the end as we would be spending most of the time out in the city.

The customer service and professionalism of the staff has dramatically decreased and even more noticeable is the deterioration of the quality of the building, the rooms and the offered services (for example the breakfast with fruit from a can vs. fresh fruit, etc).    The general management have done some noticeable cost savings which makes the experience of IFC to be more of a 3 star hotel (at best).

853,"When searching for hotels in Amsterdam, I had been there are hundreds of small locally owned hotels that do not advertise in the big US websites. So I found this on a not so big website that is actually Dutch owned (I think). I wanted a traditional Dutch looking hotel (tall skinny building, lots of steps) and I got it. You go up the front stairs then down to the basement to the front desk. The dining room is on that floor too. The hotel staff was friendly and helpful, though an off duty staff person was always praying on his prayer rug in the dining room at breakfast which made it tough to move around him. The room was very Spartan, two beds, smaller than twin beds. The closet was a cabinet on a revolving pedestal with a mirror on one side (right out of the Ikea catalog). The…",3

855,"When I booked this hotel it was a Best Western. A few months later I received an email saying it was not BW any longer and now I have been there I understand why.   This hotel is dated, not very clean. The rooms are of a reasonable size but have no air conditioning nor window that you could open. Instead they all have a glass wall that opens the view on the corridors... it certainly lacks discretion when every person passing by is looking in ! The hotel is noisy and there is no isolation whatsoever. No breakfast, no smile....  Last but certainly not least, the hotel is located on 7th street which is where all drug addicts and homeless people have decided to live. I was there with 3 kids ! Do not walk back to or from the hotel. Always take a taxi. Do not even go out of the hotel…",1
856,"My daughter and I spent 8 nights at the Hotel Recamier.  It overlooks the Church of Saint- Sulpice – a beautiful cathedral.  The hotel is perfectly situated, quiet, yet only a few minutes walk to literary cafes, such as the Café Flore, to the Sorbonne, Luxemburg Gardens, and great shopping.  The hotel is beautifully designed in neutral colors, lots of shades of grey, white and black.  Our lovely room overlooked the cathedral.   Although the Hotel Recamier is excellent in many respects, location and design, for example, the service is truly outstanding.  The people at the heart of the Recamier (Bruno, Paulo, Cecilia and most recently, Qwen) are knowledgeable, kind, gracious and generous with their time.  On a busy shopping day, I had lost a bag containing a recently purchased…",5
857,I stayed at your hotel for one night.   I have called in to report about miscalculation of the points and the eligible spend shown on the hotel bill.   Your front desk clerk at your hotel is totally so rude and unprofessional to me when I called in via Sorenson Video Relay service to request to fix the errors that cost me a couple of hundred of World of Hyatt points that I am entitled to receive.   I was told to call World of Hyatt customer service to take care of this matters and hung up on me.    I can't accept that kind of unprofessional behavior by your front desk clerk at your hotel for treating unfairly to a top tier of Globalist Deaf member.  I have bad impression about your hotel staff that is not being friendly to deaf guests even have the highest status of Globalist…,1
858,"Stayed as a family for 5 nights in 2 rooms.  The good: 1. Excellent location, near the main sights in Mitte. 10-15 mins walk to the Reichstag and Brandenburg gate 2. Quality and spacious rooms. Well maintained and spotless 3. Efficient and good service  What can improve: 1. Internet is not great for a hotel of this size and brand. It is slow and unreliable. 2. We couldnt get a double bed because we were told these dont exist in this hotel which is focused on business travelers? Strange and not for us because it affected sleep quality and comfort. 3. Absence of a proper concierge meant we had to rely on reception staff who really arent very knowledgeable. Pls use the Tourist information center in the Hauptbahnhof next door. The reception staff provided very general advice which…",4
859,"I spent 4 days at the Courtyard Xujiahui. The location of the hotel is quite central with subway stations located within walking distance. However getting taxis in the morning during rush hour can be difficult, but I guess this is par for the course for Shanghai nowadays. There are shopping malls near the hotel, so it is located in a convenient location.  I've stayed here twice and the rooms were of average size, bordering on small by China standards. It was rather cramped with a shower stall and toilet crammed by the door. The furnishings and carpet in the room were getting a bit tired and worn.   I used the executive lounge for both breakfast and evening hor d'oeuvres. Just a note - their evening hor d'oeuvres only start much later at 6.30 unlike most other hotels in the…",2

861,"I recently stayed at this hotel while in Berlin on business and was positively surprised by the spaciousness and the overall comfort of the room and especially by the great breakfast buffet, which is also very reasonably priced (as I found out when I invited someone to join me for breakfast). I asked for a quiet room and got one, WiFi was okay, reception staff was friendly and helpful and public transportation is easily accessible. All in all, this is definitely a recommendable option for your stay in Berlin. (I could certainly do without a copy of the Bible in the room and think it is not really a welcoming gesture for non-Christian visitors, but that's really the only complaint I have about this place.)",4

We arrived in the morning as our flight was too early from Nha Trang, we are starving to death so we decided to have breakfast but the restaurant staff named Huong informed us not possible to eat because breakfast time is over even there is still one table eating .. 2nd incident was the dinner we arrived @ 21:15 guests still at the restaurant and they informed ee cannot order anymore and we have to do room service, really disgusting .. 3rd incident was room service, the staff who picked up the phone cannot understand us so we have to asked help from the receptionist to order for us and waited long time too an dthe thing when the food arrived as we ordered fried rice and pizza there are no condiments the fried rice chicken was tasteless and last the staff asked us to pay…",2
863,"This was one of the worst hotels I have ever lived in, given the fact that I travel a lot. I had an impression that since this hotel is connected to the airport, it would have good standards. Turns out I was terribly wrong. The rooms were small and definitely didn't have a 4-star touch to it. The AC stopped working at night and when I called the service line they just blatantly said that the AC in the entire building is down and will not be back for the entire night and asked me to open windows if I'd wish, leave alone be distantly apologetic.",1
864,"Me and my wife visited Amsterdam this July and decided to stay at the Hotel Arena as it looked beautiful from the photos. It was great to be so close to the park and easy enough to just jump on a tram and get anywhere we needed. However there are some issues we had, even though the room we had was stylish and very nice the cleanliness left something to be desired. Upstairs there was a odd smell coming from the carpet on one side, almost like old feet smell. On our 2nd or 3rd day we noticed my wife’s pillow was disgustingly stained! (See photos), the members of staff resolved this quickly however its one of those mildly horrifying things to find and it was simply shrugged off how upset we were about it. The day after we also got back late to find out room hadn’t been cleaned,…",3

Certain staff not very proactive Mainly Russians in the hotel and not very accommodating for English as every other hotel we have stayed in Vietnam were. The room was two small beds joined together to make a double, very thin walls, noisy neighbours (not the hotels fault)  Breakfast; we were told breakfast finishes at 10am, we arrived there at 9:25am, where the lady requested to see our breakfast voucher which I found ironic as there was no food left anyway.  Coffee was cold, no juice left, milk had turned a strange yellow colour and smelled and the food trays were empty, we did not return for breakfast the following day. I understand if we had turned up at 10am and food or drinks not being replaced but to arrive with 35 minutes left and there being hardly any food to eat and nothing was being replaced, was just poor service. I would not return to this hotel again.…",2

Twice we left (airport) before breakfast, and staff couldn't even grab a orange juice, or banana for us to go with, different what we found in other hotels, who couldn't do enough for us. On our last visit they even tried to give us room that the painter was still painting, nice.",2

873,"I would never come here again. They are expensive and care nothing for your actual comfort. I stayed here for a wedding, but never again. Right off the bat things were bad. I called ahead of time to ask about parking, and they told me each room gets on car that gets free parking. Upon arrival we were told that this was not true - $63/night. We would have made other arrangements to park at a friends if we had been told the truth...and they didn't even apologize. Then, the rooms were just awful. Everything looked fancy, but was actually cheap. The rooms are TINY. No space for anything but the bed. Good luck finding somewhere to put your suitcase. They obviously want you to get out of the room and spend more money. The linens were cheap and rough - obviously a pretty low thread…",1

Never heard of a company that doesn't want more business, last minute or otherwise.  Check out was 10/8/17 and clerk was male.  Manager Ben Hou.  Our rate was ultimately corrected but the experience has stuck in our mind.  Otherwise this hotel has a lot of merit in terms of location and the pool is one of the best in terms of views.",1

As soon as I was checking in, GNATS was flying around me and all over the elevator and hallways. It followed me into my room as well. The worst part is when you are eating breakfast in the morning. I constantly have to watch over my food while I'm eating. Half of the time, the gnats ended up in my breakfast. I do not recommend this hotel unless you are fine with GNATS.",2

I took the breakfast everyday and at the checkout, they told me I should have told in advance that I would like to add the breakfast. They started a big discussion over €10. I would recommend them to already get the guest’s signature for the breakfast right when he/she is checking in. Besides that, breakfast is ok but everyday some type of food would be missing and I wouldn’t see the employees replacing the empty plates.

Cereals, choices of bread, cheese, fruits and juices from 7:30 am to 9:30am. I was also able to leave my stuff even after check out because they have a paid locker for 0.20 cents/hour. WiFi has a good connection even in the rooms - a big plus.  The staff were not friendly but we're able to answer my queries.

This hotel has many, many flaws including: - One working elevator for the entire hotel.  It can take up to 15 minutes to get up to your room.  Management keeps positing on Tripadvisor that they are in the process of upgrading but it doesn't help much when you have to wait and are late to a meeting - The hotel is exorbitantly expensive.  Soup, a side salad and a drink cost $66 via room service.  Room rates start at upwards of $400 per night.

This trip was for my 6 year old to enjoy Chicago and she did . The bright spot if our visit was Mark, our attendant or bellhop. He suggested places to eat and was extremely attentive.

They advertise that they are 300m from the beach and now with beach resorts are taking over the coast their access has been lost and  its much further to the beach.

The first room had an inch of water all over the bathroom floor and we were moved. The second one had sound problems with the TV and we had to get a technician to sort it. The shower didn't drain well. Breakfast was ordinary and all over by 9pm- in fact we almost didn't get there. Renovations started at 8.30am so no sleep in was possible.

The hotel building is a former19th century baroque style townhouse and the interior has been well preserved during the its conversion to a hotel.

If you don't like concrete, this is not the place for you.  We had two complaints however.  First our corner room was REALLY loud.  This used to be an office building, and it does not appear that any soundproofing was done to turn it into a hotel.  We listened to traffic all night and even could hear people talking outside from our 7th floor room.  Second, on a couple of occasions we could not get service.  There was literally no one at the front desk, and there was no way to call from your room.  We even called from and outside line and got no answer.",3

Great service and good polite staff. Very recommend for a few dsys stsy in Berlin.,5

However if you are a little jumpy you should also know it is right next door to a Church who help the homeless community in the city so you will encounter them.  The rooms themselves are small ( but again not that unusual in this City). There is however a combination of all the things I find annoying in hotels combined into one. Firstly not a single drawer for you to unpack into, this means that the clothes you can't hang have to stay in your case on the floor. Nice bath products are provided however they are incased in something akin to a Chasity belt meaning it's hard to get any out of them ( I guess to save the hotel the expense of refilling) .

This hotel is located on one of the busiest streets where the tram goes down however if you are thinking well that's what you get for staying in the city that's not what I am whining about! What I don't expect is to be able to hear people talking or hear someone sneeze from 5 levels up! We asked if we could change rooms they have internal rooms very no windows but we were told that we checked in too early and would have to wait until the next day even though we checked that they had rooms available. After being told that we checked out and into the Grand Hyatt (similar price) much quieter and better service all round.,1

There are many bars and several swimming pools at different levels with or without children. Most of the rooms have a view to the sea and the hills in front of the hotel, with comfortable balconies. The water of the main SPA pool is really cold, colder than the interior pool that is free and open to everybody. So the 20€ to access the SPA looks quite expensive to me, although the other elements (sauna, hamman, showers, etc...) are nicer than the main pool. By far the mian weakness of the hotel is the food.

Along the walk you will pass an extremely quaint street with pastel home and flower boxes.  I would stay again.  I would recommend to friends also.  I do not know what other size (people count) rooms they have.  We were only 2 people, for 4 nights.  It was fine for our purpose... to explore the city of Paris",5
916,"Stayed for one night in Berlin and this hotel was a nice, and unique experience. The moxy style suits this area to Berlin and had everything we needed.  Leonor the receptionist was fantastic in assisting with all of our enquiries! She was warm, friendly and has all the traits a Marriott team member should have!  We will be back!",5
917,"I booked this hostel last minute and although it is certainly not considered a fancy hostel, it is not misleading in anyway and this should be considered when booking and seeing the price. There was nothing wrong with the room, comfortable beds, clean towels etc, the only issue is it is very loud at night.The location is very handy and the staff were great, friendly and helpful. If you need a room just as a base and don't want to pay a lot then this would be ideal for you.",3
918,"I stayed there with my hubby  and our friends who we did recommended Cocobeach to as we really enjoyed our time there in previous 3-4 stays. However, it was a true disappointment to us from many issues we encountered there this time from 18 to 21Feb. My hubby would like to see their manager upon our check out to give some comments, but the reception said he was not avail and refused to give us any of his email contact. We did call back when we came back Aus but also could not get through. We sent email to them, but no feedback yet so my hubby would try again he said, and hopefully ...  Well, we can see the better facilities from their innovation since our previous stays, but the staff service is poorer. No complementary water until asked. We had an arguement with the reception…",2
919,"1. Beautiful Room!  Though I was traveling alone this trip, the room would be great for a couple and very romantic.  Lots of little details as well, like high quality chocolates on the bed at arrival, etc.   2. I loved the location.  It was a pleasant 20 min walk to the Notre Dame, about 5 minutes more to the Louvre (or a short cab ride). I love to just walk in Paris, so for me it was a perfect location, enough outside of the center that it didn't feel congested (I rented a car so it was easy to find street parking there)  3.  The staff were all super professional and kind and patient (I know almost no French).  They were always available and when I came in late, it was nice to know there was someone always in the lobby 24/7.  Not always the case for boutique hotels.  Note:…",5

First, the rooms we were given were terrible, low floors, small, view of alley and parking lot. ""Each room has a balcony""; well, ours was more like a small, dirty ledge with one plastic chair. Not a boutique experience.   Next, a boutique hotel is all about service. It was hit or miss. Many of the staff were friendly enough, but the main answer to any question was ""no"".  I had family arriving after a long flight and wanted to check them in so they could refresh themselves, say noon or one. The answer was ""check in is at 3pm"". Then I asked if our room could be made up so they could rest there until theirs became available. ""Can't promise anything"" was the…",2

I have been to the buchanon about 7 years ago. This time around, I booked 1 month in advance and due to travel difficulties, I missed my check in date and had to go directly to the conference. When attempting to check in afterward, the hotel charged me 1 night (which was fine, since I booked it), but they gave my reservation away and then told me that they had no rooms for the evening. I never heard of a check-in time limit without a courtesy call. What made it worse was that I was out of a room at 8 PM at night and it was conference week at UCSF. Then I asked for a receipt for the charge, and they…",1

Upon check-in to my room, I came across a large pile of curly black hairs that were scattered all around the bathroom floor near the sink, clearly missed by the housekeepers. There was also leftover muddy footprints throughout the bathroom floor from dirty shoes while cleaning. There was also leftover snacks from the past guest left on the carpet near the beds (dried up wasabi peas), and dried blood stains on the sheets. To top it all off, they ended up charging me for using the mini bar when I didn't even touch it! Now having to dispute this charge with my credit card company and the hotel. Such an incredibly frustrating experience; to feel like you're staying in a $200+…",1

Our room was on the second floor with our bed positioned right next to the elevator, we could hear it all night it also shook the room, along with people above us stomping around until early hours of the night which was frustrating as we had and early 5-am start! Although the room was spacious it was very dated and old, smelt like old wet carpet, with obvious quick paint patch up jobs.

They also loved the pool especially the depth, however we saw mice running along the side! I requested a room change due to…",1

932,"In addition to staff being standoff-ish, the corporate rate that I booked online was changed the day before I checked out. I was told I did not have a corporate booking (that’s the only way my company allows us to book), they informed me that I had promised to pay with a MasterCard (company card that I booked with is a Visa) and then they hiked my rate 25%. They accused me of lying about how I booked. I’ve stayed at chain hotels with better amenities and service. I will never stay there again.",1
933,"Sorry to write a bad review ! I chose this hotel based on reviews about its excellent location but in my opinion, location is the sad part about this Hotel. May be it is close to 3-4 metro statons, but its a good walk for all of them. The Bund and East Nanjing street is also a good 15 minute walk. To go anywhere you also have to foot bridge which has around 20-30 steps to climb each time, so it can be an issue with less mobile people. I was in Shanghai to attend some fair and I preferred to take taxi on all the days. There is also some issues with the GPS as the taxi driver cannot properly find this location, most of the time. On check in - I was upgraded to a suite which was nice. But the AC was not effective, I also had to call the AC technician , who changed some settings but…",2

In reality, we found this is is not possible unless you book well in advance of your stay (e.g horse riding - only six places per daily ride and at least 7 days notice needed). The ranch does not seem to have the facilites to cope when it is full. Even eating on site at the restaurant has to be booked well in advance.   There is one decent pool, but anyone under 16 is banned from using it. The kids pool (where families thus spend their time) is small, crowded and charmless. This is really frustrating given the highly daily cost, and the fact that it is the default activity if you cannot book up anything else.   We took a hilltop suite, which was of a decent standard, but our two kids (13 and 11) found sofa bed and rollout…",2

I can't see the bay and ""art deco"" means old furniture that your parents sent to Goodwill 40 years ago.  I complained because at $520 a night, you expect something better.  This fell on deaf ears.  They told me they would put it in ""my profile"".  The room is a good size room, but musty and might be cool to some, but not me.  The pool is nice and the bar outside reminds me of scenes from Miami Vice.  Everybody with our party that checked in here got the same line about an ""upgrade"".  I would never recommend this hotel to anybody unless it was reasonably priced like $100 but I guess this is South Beach.  Don't…",1

If you're a light sleeper, you'll be miserable. Bathroom drain emit a horrible stench that just won't go away despite housekeeping trying to sort it out. Staffs are commendable and try their best to help. Beyond their means to do anything. Train station opposite is helpful.",2

939,"Having stayed here previously, I can say this hotel has maintained consistently high standards. The staff are friendly and helpful and offer great service.   The hotel itself is well decorated, extremely clean and very quiet. The location is very convenient and is only a two minute walk from the Poissonnière metro station which gives easy access to all the major attractions. There are also some very good restaurants nearby.   Overall, this hotel is an excellent choice for anyone visiting Paris. ",5
940,Since this was our first visit to Paris we weren't sure which area to stay in and we were very pleased with our choice. The Best Western Premier Opera Liege is a lovely hotel in the Opera District so within walking distance of so many wonderful restaurants and sights.

Nice tv with PlayStation 4, design of the whole room made it feel so cozy.   It’s a hidden Gem!   Rooms are beautiful but I would have to say I did get a stiff neck from the pillows, they are kind of thick and I prefer a thin pillow.   Staff are really nice to talk too.   I would recommend to friends and family.  ",5

If you expect InterContinental level of hard or  software, you will be disappointed and I have been to more than 100 of them as a Royal Ambassador (highest loyalty program status level with ICs).  It would be good quality Holiday Inn or OK Crowne Plaza, however.  The hotel is far out from the city center attached to a large mall and there is a casino as well. If you come to the city for touristic purposes, you should choose one of the hotels at the city center.",2

We arrived at the hotel and all they had left was doubles. Even worse, the double rooms had small beds. Maybe a full, there was no way my wife and I could comfortably share a bed. Kinda puts a damper on the trip. I asked every night for the three nights we stayed at the hotel- never an open room with just one bed. I think it was because we booked as part of a group of 10 rooms and our group rate just wasn't enough money for us to get the bigger bed. Frustrating. Our group booking clearly stated we requested one bed.    The  second reason for the low rating is less important. The rooms were a bit dated and so were the toilets. The…",2

The concierge can sort out tram tickets and you just validate them on the day you use them at the tram stop. Breakfast was excellent and so was the service. Rooms were lovely we were given an executive room and you could not fault it. The concierge can book you on any tour. We did the free walking tour followed by a paid Third Reich tour. Both were brilliant.,5

At check in there was no recognition of Accor gold, and I had to explicitly ask to get the drink voucher, which turned out to be valid only for either a small beer or a small glass of their cheapest wine. Neither could or would they give me and upgrade.  The standard double room I was given was on the highest floor and had a small balcony. The room was small (aprox 20 sqm), but effectively designed.

The rooms, while small, were very comfortable, clean, and modern. The beds were very comfortable unlike most European hotels, and the rooms were well-equip with mirrors, lighting, ect.

The hotel did not have another means to let us in our room as the key fob to our room was not working properly. It took over two hours to get into our room and during this experience we did not get a single apology from the desk assistant or a sign of empathy. During these two hours the desk assistant did not communicate with us how she was going to handle the situation which made the situation even more worse. It was a nightmare of an experience especially after a night of celebrating my cousin's wedding.,1

This was a very spacious room with plenty of storage space, a beautiful hot shower and such a comfortable bed!  Also so very quiet.

The reception staff were very welcoming and always said hello when we passed.  We opted for the rate including breakfast, as we didn't want to have to start looking for somewhere each morning.

I took valuables out of my luggage and put them into my backpack to have with me at the beach, thinking they would be safer with me than sitting in the lobby.

You could not ask anything more for your perfect stay. Thank You Sabine for your friendliness, tips and nice conversations! People, go there. ",5
984,"The price is okay for the kind of hotel it is, but the location is terrible. The highway there is actually two highways merged together, and the exit you have to take comes with no warning, thereby making you careen across four lanes of highway traffic, which in California is a death wish. The hotel itself is clean, but they are always booked to capacity on account of Magic Mountain. Also, we had pre-booked but the people did not have our room ready, we were forced to wait after a long ride from the airport at the Denny's down the street for them to prepare it. The TV channels were okay, but thanks to the busy street and loud pool area, we could not hear it.  Another downside was that although it is advertised on Travelocity as close to everything, it took us an hour to get to…",2
985,Good standard hotel. Walking distance of Brandenburg gate. Good breakfast options but very busy and somewhat cramped. Helpful front of house staff. Rooms of reasonable size but only one pillow of no substance.,4
986,"The location is perfect for visiting the museums and getting transport around the city and to the airport. The hotel is 'quirky' in style, but obviously done up on a tight budget. The standard room is absolutely tiny, the next up is pretty small too. Smallest hotel room we'd ever slept in to be honest. The rooms were clean but airless, with the window only opening a small way. We had to have the fan on to circulate the air, although it wasn't very hot outside. There was no bottled water in the rooms. The bathroom was poorly ventilated too. There is good sound insulation though. Couldn't believe how many guests were in the breakfast room, which was a real scrum with not enough seating, and queues for the coffee machine, the tables not laid, everything help yourself. Not a great…",3

988,"The website for this place does a great job of hiding the fact that the location is terrible. Even though it is only 1-3 miles from most SF attractions, those 1-3 miles are hardly walkable—whether because of the uphill terrain to get to Pier 39, or simply because you’re going to have to walk past a bunch of homeless people smoking crack pipes or crapping on the sidewalk. No joke, we did a short walk after checking in and saw two crack pipes and two piles of smeared human feces on the sidewalk within a four block radius. The neighborhood this place is in is disgusting.   On to the hotel: while the hotel itself was just fine, but there were a few inconvenience. For one, no AC. I recognize it’s by the bay, but you cant sleep with the doors open as it’s too loud (I heard someone…",1

I regularly stay in South Beach and have been to many of your neighbor properties (including Nautilus and the W) and I've never had a worse stay in South Beach, frankly I've never had a worse stay at a hotel PERIOD.   Their check in staff was rude when we mentioned we booked via HotelTonight (despite the price difference being functionally same, don't punish someone for using an app that's easier to use and convert than your booking system even if they get an affiliate cut, they get that cut because they are an acquisition channel for you so make sure your staff cuts that crap out) and made light of the request for a room with two double beds (we made due but don't make us feel bad).

992,"We made our reservation at least six months ago. We received confirmation for a KING. Apon arrival, we were told that the hotel was over sold and we were not given our king room as promised. Fine. When asked for compensation for the mistake, we were offered breakfast. The “manager”, Justin, was completely put out even speaking to us. Unacceptable. The room should’ve been complimentary or they should’ve been willing give us free breakfast, valet, and drinks.  Starwood friends, DO NOT stay here. Disgrace to the Starwood brand. Horrible.",1

It is also brilliantly situated close to two metro stations and a variety of cafes and bars. My room was impeccably clean and the bathrooms were also in amazing condition. I would definitely recommend staying at Les Piaules!",5
994,"Located in a quiet backwater but within a twenty-ish minute walk of the centre and 5 minutes to the Metro (Avenida). Helpful staff. Breakfast buffet: ample. Decent coffee, good rolls, fresh fruit plus cheese cold meat etc. If you like your cereals, best bring your favourite unless you like muesli or chocolate flavoured things. We had one evening meal and found it inventive and well presented. Happy hour in the bar is a quirky 4-6 pm, so line 'em up pre dinner as the restaurant doesn't open until 7 30. The gym is small and rather hot. Doesn't open until 0800, though. Our room was quiet and the beds comfortable. The feng shui man maybe didn't get this far. Bring a torch because the lighting is very low so reading at the table is impossible. The tiny switches are fiddly and there…",3
995,"We spent 4 nights at Carvi Beach hotel and although the rooms were a bit bare and basic, the view was anything but! We were booked into a room with a partial sea view, and we were able to see a lot of the sea from where we were. We sat on the balcony with a snack and a drink and watched the sun set. The location was very central to a beautiful beach with the famous rock formations. The water was a bit cool to swim in mid-September, but great for sun bathing. It was also a 20min walk to town and more beaches. The hotel provided beach towel rentals at 2 euros/day + 10 euro deposit, which we got back once we returned the towels.  Breakfast each morning was good. There were eggs, bacon, sausage, cold cuts, and bread/pastries. The coffee was not that great but pretty standard for a…",3
996,Pros:  We were in a nice clean apartment in a nice neighborhood. Close to everything. Staff were very friendly.  Cons:  Appliances (one of the reasons we booked here!) were impossible to use. They need clear instructions (in English). Staff tried to help but we weren't able to use the washer/dryer or oven. Also the security deposit is not returned when you vacate.  It's now been 2 weeks since we got home and we still have not seen the credit on our credit card statement. There is no need for this type of delay!,3
997,"Got the ""sovjet-feeling"" walking down the mile long corridor to my room. OK bed - OK bathroom, but no room for toiletries. View over river nice but you have to pay for it. Silly to get the question to pay for river-view upon late arrival with next morning check-out.",2

999,"We had a real mess finding this place as there are 3 Casa Formosa's listed on Google. It was a non residing owner and the place had  a very unlived in feeling. There were no pictures on the walls and altho the beds were comfortable it seemed rather odd to be staying there without a host. Real coffee would be a good thing to have on hand, not instant. We did like the owner tho, he did his best to make our stay pleasant. A huge downside tho is that it cost us 24 Euros to park for a day and a half as there was no parking on the street.",3
1000,We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and found everything about it to be delightful.  Great location with an easy walk to the metro or to nearby sites and restaurants.  This hotel feels brand new!  The beds were comfortable and the rooms larger than other EU hotels.  The in-room music was perfect and the lobby area was comfortable and relaxing after a day of site-seeing.,4

Every single time you call the front desk, expect to stay on hold from 5-10 minutes before a live person picks up.  while you're waiting on hold you get to hear about how all their staff is busy helping other people.  that recording comes on every 15 seconds.  Will my membership status, i am allowed a late check out until 4pm.  it was only by calling the front desk (remarkably fast 4 minute hold this time) was i advised that my check out was at 2PM, drastically altering our day.

1003,"Didn't feel like Fairmont brand.  The place was understaffed, we had to wait 1 1/2 for our room and check-in, we like many others had to wait for our room at the restaurant which was understaffed as well.  This stay was waste of time and money for us.  Tonga room was booked and we ended up going outside for food and entertainment.  High price hotel but didn't feel any luxury of being at Fairmont hotel.

1004,"We have stayed here 3 times as a family and were happy to come again.  The apt was fine although showing wear and tear.  When we moved in for our 10 night stay we saw that the a/d in the living room was broken, the sinks and shower didn't drain.We reported the a/c since Melbourne can get quite hot.  There is one a/c in one bedroom and none in the other bedroom so the livingroom a/c was important.  It took 3 days for them to look at the a/c and then order a part they hoped would work.  Meanwhile the temperature is rising.  Opening the windows brought flies.  By the 5th day they knew it couldn't be fixed and they were ""sorry"".

1005,"The hotel is clean and modern and the roof top bar is a must see.  The location is good - it's about a 15 minute walk from Las Ramblas.  The room was a good size and had all of the usual amenities that you would expect.  The gym is pretty good for a hotel gym.  The food in the restaurant was really tasty and good value for money.We had an issue with our toilet which took 4 phone calls and 3 visits from the maintenance man to fix - other than that, I would only have good things to say about the hotel.",4
1006,Definitely not a 5 stars resort. More like 3.5 stars. Rooms are all outdated. Buffet breakfast and dinner are very average.  Very limited variety of fruits are provided during breakfast buffet especially of tropical fruit variety. ,2
1007,"This hotel is properly the best value for money I have ever experienced.. The location of this little private owned and very personally run hotel is a true pearl in the heart of the old town in Cannes. The owner Pascal and his little dog is making all the difference from the fancy hotels in town, which I also like :-)  However 45 Euro for a room in Cannes is something I did not know was possible at all.. But is is, and the rooms are newly renovated, clean and nice. The courtyard is something really unique and a very cozy place to have a glass of wine in the evening or having your breakfast in the morning. All in all, this i really a place I can recommend 100%",5
1008,"Very convenient location for all sights. Room, small but clean. No key available for safe in room. Hairdryer was very bashed and worked for 2 minutes then stopped until it cooled down, no use for 2 ladies! Girl On reception was very helpful and allowed us to use dryer in an empty room but man on reception next day was extremely unhelpful and directed us to the 'lady of the housekeeping' who was just rude! Breakfast was basic but not inedible. ",3
1009,"Stayed on 3d floor. There' a casino next door, connected to the hotel. Also in the lobby the loungy bass-tone music is as loud as a night club chill room. As a result my wife and I had a sleepless night as the pounding music would not stop, ever. Not sure this problem goes away on the higher floors.  Check-in process was very slow.",2
1010,"This is a lovely hotel centrally located in the heart of the Eixample.  The lobby and rooms are tastefully decorated but a bit on the small size.  I stayed in a two level suite and the lower level with the bed and bath was small.  The bath itself contained a rain shower but unfortunately the small size meant that it was impossible to move anywhere but directly under the water.  Great if one likes walking in a downpour sans hat and rain gear, but otherwise not so great.  The hotel would also benefit with more sound proofing, especially when the cleaning staff are making their rounds early in the mornings.  I did not use the restaurants or other facilities during my week stay so cannot comment on those.  ",4
1011,"This hotel is full of rugby fans here for the 7s World Cup, along with a number of guests here for conferences. They close the bar at 11pm, when the place is full of people eager and willing to pay their inflated prices for a few more drinks. On Saturday, at 10.30pm, they were more interested in stocktaking than serving and advised us to ""make this your last"" when it was only our first. The American dream has faded in so many ways and this is another. What ever happened to customer service? So disappointing in a city which has otherwise gone out of its way to welcome the rugby family",1
1012,"As other people have mentioned, the location, views, food, restaurant and pool areas of this hotel are all excellent. It is a little old fashioned and the service rather over-fussy sometimes, but this is completely understandable given the core clientele (a significant proportion being British return-visitors of 65+).  However, the room, despite being large and well-appointed, was let down by the air-conditioning. It was very noisy, and even when left on 24/7 with blackout curtains drawn against the day’s sun (as advised by the maintenance staff who came to check it at our request), it only ever achieved a low of about 20°C even though the thermostat was set much lower than this. We suspect it was either capped by the hotel to save energy/money, or inadequate. At any rate, it…",3

It is very handy that it is located berween two metro stations Joanic (L4, yellow line) and of course La Sagrada station  (L2- purple and L2 Blue). It has big enough space , it is comfortably equiped with furniture and home appliances. We were accomodated at the 4th floor, they have a nice balcony and on the top of the building there is also some sun beds for relax. The neighbourhood is very nice , Gracia is very nice area , residential and safe. We came late in the evening , the people from Sensation explained how to enter the building , very convenient.  They could do something more about updating furniture. It is not old, just too basic. The reception is in another building ,some 50-60 meters away. There are many food places in the area and two supermarkets nearby which worked until late at night. Nice place though is Sensation, I recommend it for families.…",4

1016,"Rooms are ok, even though I’m not a fan of the open bathroom concept w/o any real bathroom door. Our room was directly adjacent to the elevators, so we heard them during the day and night. Staff is not very well trained: for breakfast - very annoying. I had to reorder my latte 3x and then it was not even good - in addition, my scrambled eggs arrived as omelet and the waiter did not offer to change it. In addition, in the club lounge, the milk for the coffee was empty, but it took a lot time to first persuade the waiter that it was really the milk and then for her to refill it. Would not stay here again, if I had an alternative. ",3

Staff are very welcoming and polite. The breakfast is amazing with a large selection of breads, pastry, yogurts, cold meats, fruit and hot options. The room was basic but very comfortable, especially the bed which was amazing. Room overlooked the inner courtyard and was extremely quiet and peaceful. Wardrobe and shelves were located in the bathroom (thought this may be an issue with steam from the shower but was not). Shower worked well. The only negatives was a smell of drains every now and again and no English speaking TV channels other than CNN.",4

Explain that to two teenage girls. The free breakfast was terrible. Not even real cream or milk for coffee.  Every lamp was unplugged in the room, completely dirty and dust.  I have stayed at road side motels better than this place.",1

We kept having to ask for basic items I.e. Shower gel, conditioner, all of which are usually supplied in higher end hotels.

However due to a booking mix up, we could not  – we had received an automated reservation confirmation email (CC deposit and everything) back in February for one night just before Easter only to have it cancelled a month later. The reason given was that the email had been ‘lost’ as spam and the system ‘should not’ have taken a booking for just one night during this holiday time.  I recommend you make sure you have a ‘real’ confirmation by phone or letter or email",3

The apartment(full kitchen) is well furnished with balcony over looking the street.  The street can be quite loud if you are not use to urban noises.  I stayed in the back bedroom that had a balcony overlooking the courtyard  and a huge king size bed..  It was very quite. The bathroom is spacious and maid service is prompt and efficient.

It is a large, rambling area and a map is needed to find your way around but ample pools, lounge areas etc.  Our apartment room was large and airy with a lovely balcony which overlooked the front of the hotel - very picturesque - do remember to put the sign on the door for the cleaners as otherwise they don't come in.

When we walked into the room we quickly turned around & walked out!  Waited another hr for original accommodations.  Not much better!  Small, no micro wave or coffee pot.

We were told we would be charged $25 to our room, which we accepted. 3 days later a little over $100 was taken off my credit card. When I questioned this with reception the…",2
1043,The welcoming staff and sophisticated vibe offer a sea of tranquility in the heart of a very busy city! My 8 night stay was comfortable and enjoyable.This hotel deserves it’s 5 star status! The service was outstanding. All of this in a great location!,5
1044,"The rooms are comfortable and equipped with lots of home-automation gadgets like wireless speakers and electrical window shades.  The breakfast is of an extremely good quality and is simply tasty independently of the first-meal preferences or diets.  Personnel is somewhat relaxed and may prefer socializing with their colleagues instead of focusing on their duties. But that’s Spain and just the way they are here :)  Gym, location, roof-terrace and many other small nice details made me sure I gonna come back to this hotel.  Highly recommended!",4
1045,We stayed in room 16. PROS + Great staff. Very friendly with great manners. + The location is fantastic (just one block from the sea). + The breakfast is very complete. + At half block from a mini-market (key to get a quick take-away lunch). + Very quiet at night (very important in Cannes). + The room has an iron and an iron board (not all 4stars provide this).  CONS - The cable does not transmit English channels (just BBC and Bloomberg). - The entire hotel is inspired by IKEA elements (it could be way better). - No parasol are provided (key if you go to a public beach). - To rent the bikes is quite expensive (compared to other hotels where are free). - Not all rooms have parking available (and the area is quite busy to park).,5
1046,Normally I read many reviews before I book a hotel but we booked a room here because it was recommended by a friend who lives in Madrid and has stayed here often.  We booked an economy double room and we were stunned at how small the room was when we entered it.  It was so small we could barely fit our luggage in it and it was impossible to move around unless we climbed over each other.  I spoke to someone at the front desk and he politely explained that the hotel was a one star hotel and that the economy room was designed to be small.  He also stated there were pictures of the room on the website.  He graciously offered to move us to a larger room at no charge which we accepted.  So that was the only negative of the stay and I am willing to take responsibility for not doing my…,4
1047,Stayed here for 3 nights in september and was overall disappointed with the hotel.   Pros:  Great location right beside the beach  Nice big and clean room   Average breakfast   Cons:  Atmosphere in the hotel is strange due to the staff being quite unfriendly.   Pool is tiny and looks better in the pictures   Housekeeping wake you up every morning at 7am with their talking especially if you stay on the 14th as they have a storage room there. We went out to them and they were 4 of them sitting right outside our door sorting sheets. We asked them to be quiet but they just continued to talk loudly.   Finally the cherry on top was when we tried to check out and they tried to charge for a chip in a glass that we never even touched.   ,2
1048,"Poor communication, slow service. The hotel was hosting a large event and did not communicate to the other guests that this would affect their ability to enjoy the resort or the island. The resort failed to staff to an acceptable level to cover the demands of added people due to the event. ",2
1049,"Rooms are small but adequate. Breakfast is very basic. Mini bar and safe in the room. Staff in this hotel are all awesome, from front desk, breakfast and cleaning staff. Check in is quick. Across the road is the site seeing boats. Around the corner is the Eiffel Tower ... great location.",5
1050,"As a MARRIOTT Elite Member I was expecting a lot more from this hotel but it all went downhill really fast. To start the check in desk staff avoided eye contact at all times. Because of the location, there were a lot of youngsters having parties in their rooms which felt just like a university dorm. Contacted the front desk to see if they could control the noice level but I don’t think they managed to do anything.   The hotel is far away from most tourist sites. So being my first time in Rio de Janeiro, I found myself paying $25 each way (UBER) to the beaches, city center, etc. I recommend you stay at on of the AC Hotels in Copacabana or the Ritz (depending on your budget). If you are an athlete and want to be near the stadiums, this is your perfect spot. Keep in mind that after…",2
1051,I had a very nice stay at this hotel and would recommend it.  The decor is a bit different but nice (the elevator is a surprise).  The pillows in this hotel were easily the best I've ever experienced in any hotel.  Lots of them and several different types.  ,4
1052,"Small room.  Boring and with very basic amenities...a shower, sleep and go.  Not recommended for twin share if you are not family or feel claustrophobic.  And you cant travel with large suitcases as there is very limited space.",3
1053,Beautiful hotel. Very clean with helpful staff. It was centrally located and we were able to walk easily to the shopping district and the station where the tour bus picked up passengers. We enjoyed our stay there very much.,5
1054,All staff was pleasant and helpful but the room was not clean. Good and old bottles wee left in the frig by the prior guest. Electrical outlet near the bed did not work. There was trash in the wastebasket and trash on the grass and surrounding areas. I guess I am used to the Marriott hotel itself and would not stay in one of these vacation properties again. I only stayed one night. Disappointed. ,2
1055,"As seasoned travelers and B&B OWNERS from Houston, Texas - expressing our dismay and OUTRAGE at how completely misrepresented this B&B was...  we STRONGLY DISSCOURAGE ANYONE FROM SUBJECTING THEMSELVES TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT. We completely concur with the visitors from England, and as representatives of B&B's in the USA - apologize for their unpleasant experience...   Our booking was the same room (the only one available when we booked, and FYI -another couple in a larger room next to ours walked out while we were there!!) - every detail they mentioned was accurate - and WORSE!  The ""bed"" was not even an actual FULL size mattress - we are not a large couple and sleeping on it was simply out of the question.  NO ammentiites - a tiny corner bedside table was actually raw unfinished…",1
1056,"Stayed here as the location was amazing and they had king beds - yes king beds not those awful doubles.  Could not have been happier- staff was amazing, nice and helpful and the rooms were amazing.  My view was great, 20 yards to the train to get anywhere though the area was amazing in itself and you can walk anywhere.  Did I mention King beds? ",5
1057,The location of the Ayre Hotel Rosellon is awesome. The breakfast at the Ayre Hotel Rosellon is incredible.The Ayre Hotel Rosellon staff is very nice. But the room I stayed in the Ayre Hotel Rosellon was just ok.,4
1058,"Small basic rooms, in a cool neighbourhood, clean spaces, but all this is what you can expect from an easyHotel. If you want a budget hotel, for Amsterdam values, this is a good choice. Near by there are plenty of fine places to have breakfast or dinner.",3
1059,"When they say ""small"" in the description of the room size they should say ""shoe box"". Stayed here for 2 nights this week and couldn't get out soon enough. I've never seen such a small bathroom too. Even cruise ship cabins have larger bathrooms. The icing on the cake for me was having to go to a closet in the public hallway to find an iron and ironing board. Really, how hard would it be to put one in each room. Won't ever come back here. ",1
1060,"This hotel caught me by surprise. It is not spectacular regarding the cafe or lobby area, however, the room we had seemed to be a HUGE studio with 3 beds. It worked out wonderful for us four traveling. Also, the train station is across the street and it is not far from the several attractions in Berlin. Good price for great facility.",4
1061,Hotel is clean and staff are welcoming. Rooms are spacious (although not large). Ideal if you want to stay centrally on the Left Bank. An interesting area (just by the Theatre de l'Odeon and very near the Boulevard Saint Michel/Boulevard Saint Germain) if you want to wander around.,5
1062,"The Hotel is placed in the heart of Berlin and easily to access be S Bahn Friedrichstrasse.   The rooms are nice. I had a standard room, the bed was somehow comfortable, but very short. The bathroom was neweliy renovated. However, there was some chark and mold in the shower.   The breakfast buffet is very nice, offers a plenty selection of opportunities for breakfast. Very nice.   In general the staff is very friendly. At all very recommendable.",4
1063,"Good - very attentive and helpful staff, I emphasize VERY; decent selections of both Western and Chinese breakfast  Bad - rundown hotel rooms, visible stains on the carpet, filthy bathroom (the corners of walls are covered with a thick brown substance)  The ugly - when I opened the hotel room door for the first time, I noticed a small cockroach crawling right on it.  How is this a 5 star hotel?",2
1064,"We stayed at this hotel early July 2015.   The hotel looks beautiful from the outside and the staff is friendly and helpful.  There were two main drawbacks during our stay. The first was that if was  REALLY far from Lisbon and attractions such as Fatima.  Unless you are an avid golfer (which I am not) this is not the place for you. The second really major drawback were the number of flies everywhere. The restaurant has the flies flying at their leisure and parking themselves on the buffet tables. This was most disagreeable. The flies got into my room and I spent all night trying to catch and kill the flies. No sooner than  I would kill one, another  would appear out of nowhere.  I did not sleep well.  I did raise my concerns with the management and they admitted that it was a…",3
1065,"Horrible hotel! First off it's like stepping into the 80's, I paid for a upgrade thinking it would be better in the newly renovated suit but NO! Small TVs about 19 inches  I was told they had a beach view room if I up graded, Yea! out the corner window! Was afraid to park my car out check out)  But they didn't know by who! But wait I was charged  $100 dollars because they said my room smelled like smoke!! But the Manger of the hotel refused to go up to the room and check! Instead she sends me up with a employee that spoke NO English but was to explain to me what she smells, mind you there was No ashes, ashtrays, burn marks  or any proof of smoking in the room! I've stayed in many Hotels on south beach and never have I written a review but this place is a complete rip off!!!",1
1066,"Great location only 10mins walk from Sagrada Famillia with cracking restaurants and shops on your doorstep.  The metro is literally outside as is a busy road so expect noise (albeit that will be everywhere).  The beds were great, the service efficient and the inclusion of a room safe and good overall security/entry systems was reassuring.  Enough facilities and space for our family of 4 to exist happily for a few days!",4
1067,"We stayed here for my 50th birthday celebrations in May 2018. Absolutely loved the hotel and the surrounding area. The rooms are amazing, clean and comfortable too and breakfast was lovely. Lots to see in the area and you notice something different in the hotel every time you walk in. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Paris.",5
1068,"I was very appreciative to receive an early check in and get into my room in the morning after a very long travel day.  The rooms were clean and pretty standard.  Fitness center is pretty small and basic, but gets the job done.  The breakfast spread is pretty good and filling, but the service could be better. On several occasions, I felt the breakfast staff were trying to get me to leave but constantly trying to clear my plates and my coffee cup, which they give you once you sit down.  Upon checkout, I asked if the front desk could call be an uber to the airport because I did not have good service.  The front desk simply said noo you have to call your own uber, without even providing an alternate suggestion on how to get to the airport or offering to call a cab.  All in all,…",3
1069,"This hotel is fairly new with very clean rooms,  very comfortable double bed, good size bathroom with plenty of hot water. Was disappointed to find that  The express in Holiday Express means that the room is bear, no toiletry no  stand for your baggage, no microwave and no safe  but everything was satisfactory otherwise.  The staff was very courteous and helpful and it was nice to have a big smile in the morning. The breakfast was a continental one Including hard boiled eggs, sliced meat and cheese  but nothing hot except the coffee and hot water... We did enjoyed the breakfast and the staff  was quick to clean and to replenish. The tram is one block away; # 5 is a local tram but I highly recommend you wait for the # 51 which is more of a subway tram that uses tunnels here and…",3
1070,"Not the best 5 star experience. We waited almost an hour for our room to be ready  because our booking was lost, the room was very small and the hotel bar was taken over by a nightclub event. However, the spa was excellent! It’s worth noting that our room was not in the same building as the spa (separated by a road), so wandering around in our dressing gowns was not an option........check which building you’re booked into ",3
1071,"Normally that sort of thing wouldn't bother me but it was like sleeping in a pizza oven at night. Real shame. The staff are fantastic though and the breakfast incredible with a huge variety, don't however expect full English type of thing. Get a travel card and public transport will drop you right outside. Overall very good. ",4
1072,"Excellent value for money.  I feel at home at Amano. Beautiful, clean rooms. And last but for sure not least the staff. Social, customer- and service oriented, nice people. Located in the Mitte district you can wander off  to the other parts of Berlin by public transportation easily. ",5
1073,I stayed in cachet hotel for two nights. The hotel is clean and is very nice. We arrived at 9am and we got early check in without any problem.   We asked for guidance to buy our train tickets from Shanghai to Beijing and were unable to do so. In our check out we asked them to call a taxi for us and take us to the train station and they send us to a wrong station which made us loose our train to Beijing. ,2
1074,"Booked through Hilton App and as a member I thought we will get better room/ service, but I was wrong and exactly opposite happened. The room given was not very attractive on 2nd floor with old garage looking straight through the window. Quite inappropriate for a family and quite illogical by the Hotel front desk executive.  ",1

And if you look further (once you're checked in) you'll find a selection of sweets (candy - if you're American!).   Good Old Fashioned Service? - Again this is great. The desk service is quick, confident and friendly with a happy welcoming feel... nothing feels scripted or faked.  Some Good Old Fashioned Details? - It's a great hotel - Street Art on the doors and up the stairway, unique room interiors and it's in a very central yet quiet part of Berlin just next to a U-Bahn station so easy to get about too!  Should you go? Yes, the rooms are a decent price of just over €100 and for that you get a good…",5
1076,"Asked for poached eggs a la carte, they told me that this could not be ordered.  Had to order an entire breakfast for $20.   No lobby with any chairs.  Asked for a bottle of water from concierge after spending $350 per night for two nights and she looked at me like I was from another planet...like 'we don't give water'  Hyatt and other hotels always hand me multiple waters and leave them by the bed each night.  No extra roll of toilet paper.  Only a slim roll ending.  Had to call for toilet paper.   Will never stay at any Intercontinental hotel again after this experience.  I stay at all other chains, Hilton, Hyatt, SPG, Marriott.  This company is  a joke.",1
1077,"The staff was great, but the place will drive some guests crazy. American travelers may find the accommodations spartan. Our room had a lot of sunlight, which was great. It's an easy walk to Las Ramblas, and the Metro station is a block or two from the front door of the hotel.",4
1078,A bit of a throwback to the sixties. Quite small rooms which are basic. (even though we stayed in a superior room). Having to walk up and down over a bridge to get to the room was annoying after a while. Pretty soulless by modern standards. ,3
1079,"Breakfast was horrible. There was almost nothing to eat, hard bread, cakes too dry and price was so expensive. My family hated. Room was OK and organization was so so. Wireless was Ok, but it didn't work in a first moment and I had to go to reception to request.",2
1080,"This is our third visit and always enjoy staying here. The hotel is immaculate from top to  bottom. We always stay in the same room on the  6th  Floor  with a view of the rooftops. We received  a warm welcome back from Fabienne, Zorana, and Henri. The  neighborhood in which this hotel  is located is where the Parisians live and  not  filled with tourists and this enables us to blend  into Parisian life. The markets on Rue des Martyrs offer high quality food and patisseries. One important  thing about the  location is that it is central  to get to all areas of Paris. The value for the money here is  better than anyone would think for the quality of this hotel. We are talking about returning next year!",5
1081,"We stayed in a top floor room, it was street facing but still very quiet. The rooms were old but clean and nice. The bed linens were decent, the bathroom was very clean. The breakfast was fantastic.  The hotel offers free parking immediately behind the building.  Really, there was not a single thing to complain about.",4
1082,Agree with the sentiments of the other 5-star reviews that the vibe and atmosphere are very funky and up. Staff were up and helpful. Good location with plenty of eateries within 5 minutes. Travel to centre is easy,5

However, the last time I was disappointed about many things.   - Breakfast starts at 6am, but the eggs and omelets only at 7am (I go normally for an early Business meeting or flight so I cannot enjoy this service) - Japanese Restaurant works only from Monday to Friday - They made an update in some fitness machine, but the Treadmill, Lifecycle and the Cross Trainer are so old and rusty, nothing to do with Golden Tulip Standard. By the way, these two or three workers in the Fitness Center are so unfriendly, not even welcome the guest, only on the internet playing and no support at all. - When I arrived, they said no Internet or TV-Channels until 9.30mp - The air-conditioning didn’t work for 2 Days in the…",2

Arriving fairly late in the evening, we did not see the 'view' from the hotel room's window until the next day.   I booked on the hotel's own website and paid full price (over $1600) in order to guarantee we had breakfast and a king room - however now I know that the breakfast vouchers are $7 from reception and the rooms very small, I would have gone via booking.com which at the time was about $500 cheaper overall!

It was a stain that never should have been missed by housekeeping. I reported it to management who just offered to have the bed sheets replaced.

There are bus stops right outside the hotel but it’s time consuming and the closest station is about a 14 minute walk. The hotel itself is very nice, clean and very good service. Having said that, on my next visit I would probably stay closer to the Brandenburg Gate even though it will more than likely cost a bit more. . ",4

The pool area is lovely- comfy sun beds and once again very clean. The towels are of good quality too.   On our last night we decided to eat at the restaurant- initially service was ok.

The customer service was really good, especially as KLM had lost my luggage, and the front desk staff were very helpful regarding this. The breakfast was really good, and plentiful. The hotel itself is right across the street from Berlin's main train station, which normally would mean a lot of noise, but I couldn't hear anything of it from my room. It also meant that we were a 10 minute walk from the Reichstag and other Mitte sites.

1103,Only ate at the restaurant but with the fish and chips they brought us each fewer than ten French fries. When we asked the staff for some more (as the amount they gave us was truly laughable) they said yes but then waited until we finished our food then came and told us we couldn't have any more fries. The fish was quite nice but the attitude of the staff was seriously lacking and as such we would recommend avoiding this restaurant if you're at the beach. Obviously this is only a review of the restaurant and not of the resort as a whole.,2

The food was mediocre in comparison to other hotels we have visited in India, and slightly overpriced.

1109,"I was on business in London and decided I wanted a weekend get away.   The hotel is positioned as a beach hotel and I noted quite a few honeymooners. Facilities are excellent lots of pools both on top and lower down and you also got the choice of going lower to the water edge. Lots of choices for restaurantes from buffet to menu choice. The buffet seemed the most popular, I assumed package tours. Checking in good even though late at night and someone to help with the bags and park the car, check out the same.  Strange to see vinyl floor I had not seen this since I was a child made the room look cheap instead of tiles but was a warmer surface to walk on. The hotel is also a little dark in the corridors so make sure you get a sea facing room, great for just relaxing and watching…",3
1110,"This hotel,has a good location and a very good breakfast with excellent. waiting staff but that's about all the good I can find to write about. The staff at reception were ok. Some very good but many couldn't care less and service was a foreign word to them. Some were downright rude.  The tours arranged from the desk are only ok and the hotel will not accept credit cards so you  must get cash. They are not cheap. Yes, the hotel is across the road from the beach but that does not make up for the poor tired rooms, the miniature bathrooms, the late room cleans and the absolutely shocking Internet service which  the hotel charges for.  Tis hotel may be only 3 stars but it does not give value for money and they really should pull their sox up.",2

We then checked in to a rude blonde women who wouldnt check in my girlfriend without me there even though she had all the paperwork and my cards! The room was brilliant! We was in 303 but the shower handset was broken couldnt fix it back up! But apart from that small defect the room was excellent! Then came the Saturday ziggo dome rave night right next to us! Was ok until about 5am when people was leaving and across the street was the taxis....beeping there horns about 30 of them and this didnt stop until about 8am. i was so mad! From here you will need to get the metro train to get into town Another 44 euros for 2 people for 4 days! to be fair a great hotel…,3

At the first glance it does not look as 4 star hotel as it  is not as big you can expect , it remain as a great hotel with compfortable beds, cleaness and generous "" hotel concept"". I loved the honesty bar though I do not drink.  The receptionists, mainly David and Roxane, were extraordinarily helpful and generous. I do recommend the hotel for the reasons listed above and the follwoing: great location in the 9th avenue, closer to the main malls ( Lafayette and Le pritemps) apart from many other shops and restaurants that cater to all tastes. Also, the railway station is a stone's throw away from the hotel.",5

Within a minute walk you can take the U8 or U7 to all interesting places. The view from my room was not that great, and it was a little noisy since it's located near a main road, but the insulated window did the job.",4

Being the bride, I didn’t know where we were staying until we literally showed up, and I genuinely was blown away by the superb location and ultra-modern aesthetic. To say I was pleased would be an understatement! The doormen were incredibly friendly—we were off to a great start!  My friend who had arranged the booking brought me up to speed that she had 3 rooms for the 14 girls, each room had 2 beds and they had paid for three roll out beds (confirmed on her receipt) — it would be a tight fit, but we were all thrilled and happy to be reunited.   The stay then took a drastic turn for the worse. I want…",1

1120,"Maybe we were unlucky because there are so many glowing reviews of this hotel, but this was the worst hotel stay during our trip to Vietnam. It is located down a small, quiet  backstreet and I felt a little uncomfortable walking back at night. The towels were old and dirty and the bed linen was torn. The internet was extremely slow (even on their PC with LAN connection - if you were lucky enough to get the PC to work!). Worst of all, we kept running out of hot water and the staff would instantly send someone up to ""fix it"" (despite asking them to wait) while I sat there feeling terribly uncomfortable in a towel!",2

All the staff we met were friendly and helpful.  The breakfasts were great, Lots of choice and plentiful.  The hotel is located in a quiet side street just off Ku'damm and a very short distance from a bus stop (so we got the bus from Tegel for just a couple of euros).   I'd stay there again (but would make sure I didn't forget anything as the cost to return the item to me was a little OTT)",4
1122,"Aside from the location, I can't say one good thing about this hotel. The staff was rude and incompetent. The rooms were worn down, beat up, old and dirty as well as extremely small. I prepaid for a 2 night stay and left after the first night because it was so gross. After arguing with the management about getting a refund for the second night, the best they offered me was 25% off my next stay (unless it was a blackout date). I told them I wouldn't stay there again if it were free. For those looking to book, the price is attractive because of the location, but there's a reason for price...",1

We had a great time at Berlin and at this hotel, would definitely return.",4

No chance to leave the window open at least you did not mean to fell directly from ten bad to ground (we were at the last floor)... And last but not least, really miserable breakfast. Unacceptable. No brioches, nothing sweet to eat than toasted bread or two dried cakes all along the five days of our stay.  And one day we even had to wait for more than ten minutes to have a seat Finally, our bad has never been made! Simply the quilt was pitted back!",3

Upon arrival I was surprised because I had to pay beforehand for my stay although I had given a credit card for confirmation. The room was nice and the bathroom was also clean, new and with all the toiletries needed. We had a nice breakfast and were quite pleased with this hotel although a bit far away for anyone without a car to move around the city. But the worst was yet to come. During the night, my car had been broken in, lots of smashed glass and everyting scattered on the front seat. Nothing was robbed because i do not usually leave anything inside the car. The staff of the hotel upon knowing this had happened were very nice,…",3

Whole of the hotel was very clean. Could not have been in a better location, never seen so many shopping centres and they were all on doorstep. The underground station and the normal train station were on doorstep too. We walked everywhere as we found that most popular tourist attractions were not that far. Some great restaurants about a 10 min walk away, ask concierge or reception. The only downside was no free WiFi, if you wanted WiFi it was over 9 euros a day, so we didn't bother. Did go on train to bradenburg had a look round then got back on train and got off at potsdam, which is lovely place.  Got back on train to…",4

When we asked to change the room, the receptionist was really unhappy and said she can do nothing, as the hotel is full.  When we asked about the room size (actually that was the reason we chose this hotel in the first place), she also said, that the manager will be at work only on Monday (we arrived on Saturday), so nothing can be done. In the end,…",2
1132,"The Amsterdam Canal Hotel is a very nice hotel, located near the museum district (walking distanziert about 10 minutes). The staff were quite nice, some of them even helpful - especially the Scottish girl. Unfortunately our room was to the front side which meant that it was very loud even at night since the tram and many motorcycles were driving ""through our room"". The air conditioning was in repair so we had to sleep with an window to avoid suffocating. The rooms to the canal side are quieter, but more expensive. The hotel should add a hint regarding the noise disturbance in the front rooms - we were very disappointed. The breakfast is very good! ",3

We requested that we use the exec lounge so we could get peace and quiet while working and the staff misunderstood and communicated to the GM that we wanted free breakfast and that was why we wanted to use the lounge.  The GM in turn offered that we could trade in points for breakfast OR he would give us free breakfast but no SPG points for our stay....and then went on to explain how this was a great deal !!

Our friends room across the hall was nice and cool and did not smell.   Water in shower ran very hot to cold throughout shower.   No bar, restaurant, shopping of any kind in Q-Box.

The hispanic man at the front desk told me I had to pay $15.00 for breakfast.  My husband paid the $15.00 even though I thought that it was a little weird.  I called down to the front desk and asked if everyone pays for breakfast because it said complimentary.  The young lady who answered said that it was complimentary.  I asked if I could have my breakfast sent to my room.  She said we do not send breakfast to the room but for the misunderstanding she would make an exception.

I asked reception after checking into our dorm if the rooms were cleaned after finding tweezers,used chewing gum and sweets down beside my bed - to which the guy on reception said we were able to request for our room to be cleaned - therefore I take that the rooms don’t get cleaned often without a request?

They give tags to teenagers below drinking age so that no alcohol is served to them but be sure that your teen keeps the tag on at all times otherwise there is no way the hostel staff can tell what age he is.  Children come to buy sweets were adults are buying alcohol. I wish they would have two areas-one for children and one for adults.  The rooms are clean and wifi works in all rooms.

The location is excellent and very safe - we are two young women and felt fine going out at night etc. Wittenbergplatz U-Bahn station is right outside and has fantastic links to Potsdamer Platz and Alexanderplatz which was very useful. There is also a supermarket right next door which was great for stocking up on all sorts of German stuff to take back home! And the Kurfurstendamm is great to just wander up and down - lots of restaurants and cafes nearby too.  The room was very clean and bright. Small, but that's to be expected.

It is the theme of the hotel, but it seems that if all the lights were on and the random curtains and drapings removed, a drab interior would remain. The single elevator is small but the staircase is nice and we were on a lower floor.  The rooms are small, esp compared to our other hotels. We had two stays at this hotel at the start and end of our trip, and upgraded the room on the return to have more space (gallery to tribune room class).

The hotel uses motion sensors to turn on hallway lights on which means that hallways can be pretty dark until you move into them.  The shower leaked and, although we called the front test twice, it was never fixed.  The hotel gives you a bar credit if you pass on cleaning services, but we had to keep using towels to soak up the water.  We thought they had a safe available, but there are no safes in the room or in the lobby.  The hair dryer kept overheating after about a minute of use.

The staff was courteous and professional. The room was clean, spacious (70 sqm, 1.5 baths) and very nicely furnished and equipped. The view from the 29th floor was lovely and the hotel's location is excellent--just minutes' walk to shopping, dining and subway. The bed, however, was unbearably hard, and made for a horrible night's sleep. For this reason alone we will not return to Swissotel.

My only complaints are that there is no privacy if you would like to enjoy your room balcony and the shower was quite moldy and didn’t look cleaned. I would imagine all hotels would have this similar problem being they are built into the side of the cliff but anyone above you can see all the goings on of different rooms.  When trying to sun bathe we would look up and groups of people would be above us camped out waiting for the sunset, which I understand but It just wasn’t relaxing for us.",3

There were only 4 seats left so we were lucky since we are only 2.   The day of our departure/19th, we found out several minutes passed the pick-  up time that they never reserved our seats. Had I not asked if the shuttle was running late and continued to wait, I would have become very upset and would have been stressed getting to the airport to make our flight. We were told that the reservation was never made and that the shuttle would not be coming to the hotel that morning. Even the 9:15 shuttle would not be coming to the hotel.    Thank goodness for uber as it arrived within 2 minutes.",3

An example, we wanted al-la carte breakfast on the Sunday morning and it took literally 20 minutes to bring a coffee even though the place was hardly full (and most were self service with the buffet). Lots of people looking busy but nothing happening. We asked for ice to be brought to the room and it took three phone calls and 40 minutes before it came. They provided a Nespresso machine in the room but room service cleared the cups and didn't replace them or any capsules so we had to call down in the morning. You guessed it, they took 20 minutes and went to the wrong room (and woke the kids up). On the first day I found this very annoying, but by…",4

Upon check in, the front desk lady (who maybe been having her all year long, period) shows me her very long face and telling me there r no non smoking room for now and straight pointed to a smoking room.

Okay then, I understand also this is what a  classic chinese hotel will do u. I took another chance to ask if the room smells will be very strong, she reply :"" It is okay""...  The room?

1176,Great location. Almost walking distance from everything. Staff are very friendly warm and helpful. Main issue is cleanliness of hotel. Floor of room was sticky and room had a musty smell. Rooms are nicely decorated however housekeeping is not one of their strongest points. It’s superficial the cleaning done. Can just tell when you walk in to the rooms and confirmed after staying for a few nights. Good hotel if you are looking for a place as a base to explore Lisbon but if you want to enjoy the comfort of a hotel room think you need to look elsewhere. If management improved upon the housekeeping think this will be an excellent hotel. ,3
1177,"The apartment was bigger than expected which was a nice surprise, with a minimal contemporary design and lovely big comfortable bed and sofa. Very quiet and efficient air con. Good location especially if you want to be close to the Sagrada Familia which is literally just round the corner. On the downside I was not happy that the reception was closed when we arrived at 3pm. A cleaner let us in and we had to use the 'hole in the wall' automated check-in which was frankly rubbish - very poor touch screen, took ages and a very impersonal start to our stay. The cleaner called someone and handed the phone to me and the lady explained that the receptionist had to go home early ill, but surely a company which promotes itself as 'boutique' should have enough staff to cover? This also…",4
1178,"This used to be classy and serene hotel, worthy of its 5-star status.  Not any more.  It’s now become a hotel with a nightclub with outdated 3-star rooms that are no better than most motels. Customer service is way down the list of importance, and the whole place has a huge egotistical air about it - and that includes the staff.  This visit cost me over $1500 for my family, and we were treated to a lobby full of raucous, drunken half naked spring-breakers. What has happened to any standards at this hotel? Truly shocking. We basically became prisoners in our rooms, and the whole visit was a stressful entire waste of money.  I made a huge mistake staying at the Fontainebleau which will not be repeated. The Four Seasons in Brickell blows it out of the water in each and every…",1

We came back to our room around 8pm and the room was 85 degrees. No one had come by to check it out. After having to go down to the front desk 2 more times to ask for help, 40 mins later a guy came up and determined it was broken. I even cleaned out the vents in the AC because they were so clogged and dirty to try to fix it myself. The man promised us a partial refund and moved us to their other (more dumpy) motel, where we stayed for our last night. So we packed our bags, drove there, and our room was 92 degrees inside. Sat outside for over an hour until the AC kicked in. It has been 10 days and I have called several times and…",1

Long story short, they gave us the brides suite (which adjoined her mothers). As my husband began to get in the shower, we heard the door to our suite open and the sound of voices!!!! Yes!!! It was the bride- shocked to find us in her ROOM!! Yes!! They issued the same key to two different families! Needless to say we were all embarrassed! So now the bride (furious) because previously they had been telling guests early in reservations all the rooms were ""taken"" and they were out of rooms!!! She had to straighten that problem out in person.      It was their mistake. To their credit they gave her a better room but by her mothers suggestion. This made us…",1
1182,"Booked two rooms, one was a suite and one a deluxe room, both lovely rooms. Large bathrooms, comfy beds, lots of space. The only negative about with suite was the noise from the traffic outside, the other room faced the courtyard which was very quiet.   The thing I love about this hotel is the sense of peace and tranquility, some other hotels seem too busy. The staff in reception were very helpful when needed.   The bar was lovely with very friendly staff who remembered everyone’s drinks from the night before.   We ate in the restaurant one night, the food was great but the service let it down as we had to keep asking for the wine to be topped up (the bottle was away from our table), also I think for the price it could be made into more of an event.

It's in the heart of Oia, you are everywhere really quickly. The sunset terrace is great too. Good wifi, breakfast ok. Everyone really friendly!  Unfortunately the hotel is quite worn (deckchairs, chairs, room, beds, bathroom). If you look closer, you see a lot of details that could use refurbishment or investment, which is a pity since the hotel would or could be so nice. The furniture in the room is kind of outdated. But the room was really big, which is a plus. Since it's Oia, we didn't expect the world for the price. But maybe a teeny tiny bit more (like clean trays at breakfast ;). This is why the hotel, in my opinion,…",3

Most ameneties were closed during my visit. The town practically shuts down at 16.30 and considering the amount of hotel space here, this is ridiculous. We found one bar/restauraunt open until 10(9.30 last orders). The food is average. We spent the night in a hotel in the village which was 4m VND for an average room which is four times what we paid elsewhere for nicer hotels. Check out is at 10.30 which is the earliest I've ever heard of. I ordered room service twice because we were room bound from 10pm.

1186,We paid $400 for our room and we had to stay for one night with a big noise coming from the AC in front of us. They didn't offer us to change our room or a discount because of that. We called them and they said they were sorry but the maintenance guy wasn't at the hotel. They are also close to the lake tahoe blvd and it's noisy if you are close by. Rooms too small. I prefer paying $100 more and going to the Marriott. Jacuzzis were bigs but the pool was like at the motel.,2

Sure, rooms are typically small, as is the case in Paris, but inviting and comfortable.  For Paris, their room rates are great for what you get. Hotel was clean as a whistle, and staff were helpful and attentive. Enjoyed the breakfast. Staff assisted me in planning transportation to various sites.  We had arrived in Paris at the Gare du Nord, and took one bus (Magenta) which dropped us off in front of hotel within 15 minutes. Another day we took one bus to get us to the Arche de Triomphe where we grabbed a city wide tour bus.  We got off at Notre Dame and then took the metro back to the Gare du Nord.…",5

Good breakfast  Cons Staff is generally helpful but the service is not consistent. We were misinformed thrice by the hotel staff: 1. We needed a van taxi as we had 4 big luggage’s. Staff 1 told us the taxi fare for the standard taxi and van taxi was the same. She assured us it was really the case, after we tried to clarify if this was correct since logically a bigger taxi should cost more, but we figured they were the experts so we trusted them 2.

Reality: 1 - Apartment no 7A is the highest one and the view is the roof of the Abasto Shopping Centre... hardly a beautiful view. 2 - No sofa bed!!  Further: The non-stick frying pan is in POOR condition with almost no Teflon coating still present as is one of the other cooking pots. The kitchen sink is tiny and easier to wash up in the bathroom basin. The cooling towers of the shopping centre are diagonally opposite the balcony and the noise from them is so bad, it is impossible to sit on the balcony and enjoy any peace!  We arrived on Xmas day and made clear arrangements to get the keys and access as we knew that this was a difficult day. We had to wait for 40 minutes on the pavement to get access... extremely poor!!

When my husband and the rest of the party joined us for tea we were moved into a dark and dreary dining room with no windows or view at all. Not all of the lights were on and it was very depressing.

Access to the bath & shower was very difficult as the glass screen was fixed & we never found out how to use the shower satisfactorily. Half board was compulsory, but the quality of food in the self service restaurant (closed at lunchtime) was mediocre & the only alternative for dinner within the hotel was a Japanese restaurant.

We were given a room on the 4th floor.  The room size was the smallest room I have seen and the view was of the hotels air conditioners.  We asked for a new room and were given a room on the 7th floor just a door or two down from the original room.

It is indeed well placed for the centre of Amsterdam, close to the museums etc. and has been tastefully restored inside a splendid  old building.

The suite was slightly better, but still not what I would expect from a 4 star hotel.

The property is new and very well lit. The rooms are huge. My parents are owners on Maui and I owned a Marriott property at St. Thomas (because I'm a chump). Marriott Timeshares are awful because they sell this idea that the owners are somewhat elite or VIP.

Pool is nice although a little small for the number of guests and consequently the number of sunbeds is pretty limited and if you're not out early you may struggle to get sunbeds, especially if you're a family and you need 3 or 4 together.

1217,"I have visited Villa Branca on numerous occasions and unfortunately standards continue to slip. The location is excellent and a great place to holiday as a family with young children, but when paying a premium price you would expect basic pool cleaning and maintenance of surrounding areas to be conducted on a regular basis. During our stay sunbeds and tables were not cleaned, just a cursory sweep and bins emptied. In addition the standard of pool maintenance is diabolical, the filtration system is inoperable and has been for numerous weeks,(friends stayed two weeks prior to us), resulting in low water levels and in turn cloudy water, debris floating in the pool and on the pool floor. Sun canopies and umbrellas are dirty and in a poor state of repair, and have been for some time as we have witnessed their decline over the years.   These issues are clearly a managerial problem and need to be addressed at said level. When paying a premium price you would expect some investment in the infrastructure.

1225,If you’re looking for a very basic hotel then this will do the job for your trip. The rooms are tiny. It’s difficult to open your suitcase. The bed isn’t comfy and you only get one pillow. The rooms aren’t cleaned throughout your stay so if you need anything you need to ask at reception. It’s on the noisy side so I don’t recommend family’s staying here. If you’re young and will be coming in and out at all hours it’s perfect. The rooms are clean and the staff are as helpful as can be. The room does the job. This is my second time staying at the hotel. Although I don’t think I’ll be returning for a third time as the rooms are just so small.,3
1226,"好處：  * 有高科技手環可以開門、從自動販賣機裡買零食或飲料，十分方便 * 提供免費的高速行動 wifi * app 提供在地嚮導：輸入想找的東西，傳回目前所在位置後他們的工作人員會在幾分鐘內回傳建議地點跟個人意見，算挺有用的 * 地點佳：距電車站步行五分鐘，旁邊有市場和美食街等等，很方便  壞：  * 住宿風格就是青年旅館，由這點看價格有點太貴（但品質是比青年旅館好上一些） * App 有點欠測試，在 iPad 上居然有些功能不能用或破版  Good:  * RFID wristband, which you can use to open the door, buy drinks/snack from vendor machine. Really convenient. * They provide free high-speed mobile wifi. * You can send your location information and tell the staff what you are looking for, the staff will reply in a few minutes with a suggest place and his/her own comment. Pretty cool. * The location is good enough: 5 minutes from the nearest tram station, with a market and the famous ""De Hallen"" nearby.  Bad:  * A little bit overpriced for a hostel style accommodation. (The quality is slightly better…",3
1227,"Stayed here for one night last month after a gap of over an year +. Had a terrible check-in experience, with the lady at counter totally disinterested in checking in a guest. No smile/no greeting and a totally cold reception. Took 15 minutes plus for her to check me in. Tried connecting with the duty manager - he did not answer the call - spoke to me later though and moved the lady to back office. A simple apology and this action seems to be the only thing that the duty manager was authorized to offer !!  Rooms are in an urgent need to be refurbished, most furniture and fixtures are worn out and look very old. Faucets in the bathroom were loose and leaking - making me wonder if i was staying in some budget category lodge??  Hotel was sold out and the breakfast section had a long…",2
1228,They pump so much scents into the lobby you can't even breathe. Do not stay here if you have a fragrance sensitivity.  If they just would clean the place better maybe would not have too.  What are they trying to hide?  ,1
1229,"We originally thought we would stay 1-3 days,but stayed nine, because both my wife and 93 year old mother were sick from the beginning of this trip and we thought one or both might end up in the hospital. We got a double-bedroom unit that was very nice and was perfect for our needs.The staff was very accommodating and tried to make our stay as pleasant as possible. The hotel, itself is modern and in good condition. Breakfast was very good - in the top tier. They had fresh orange juice and great coffee. Pastries were wonderful. Lots of very good yogurt that my mother lived on, as her stomach was quite sensitive. The hot chocolate was superior. I believe they had eggs, too and much more, but I am writing thi review a year later so it's a little hazy. Suffice it to say that I…",5
1230,"The hotel is well located, close to transportation, plazas, and shopping area. Staff are friendly. I would recommend the hotel to friends and family. Breakfast was very good. I enjoyed my stay there!!",4
1231,"Pluses... Nice staff but a little disorganised. Great location.  Minuses... So noisy. Noisy water system, noise from outside (no soundproofing) and from other guests. Lift too small for so many rooms. Construction means the layout is odd and a little confusing.",2
1232,Hotel stay was fine however upon checkout when the clerk asked me if I used the minibar I advised yes I had a sparkling wine. Just wondering why this was not charged there and then with the rest of my bill. It appeared on my credit card a few days later as a new and seperate charge along with the fee they charge for using a credit card. Therefore I paid two sets of credit card fees for absolutely no reason. Is this a rort on behalf of the hotel or just someone at reception going through the motions who does not listen to the customer for a question that they themself asked. Very unimpressed.,2
1233,"Not that much to recommend here. Aircon was close to useless despite alleged repair. Pool small with very little area around it. Small rooms. Tighter bathrooms. On a more positive note, it’s not expensive & it’s well located. Staff were very accommodating too. ",2
1234,"You can hear construction, road noise, toilets flushing / water running in nearby rooms, people in the halls. The entire hotel needs to be soundproofed. Electrical outlets are hard to come by (the one in the bathroom was next to the toilet, not anywhere near the sink). ",1
1235,The Location was dirty - any you can not comapre what you see in the Internet. It is less than 20% of what you see in the Internet. The toilet is to small to sit on the toilet. The room was dirty if we stepped in. The pool was dirty.,1
1236,"3 of us (2 adults/1child) stayed at this hotel for 1 night. The hotel is in a great location, near to the Van Gogh Museum, Rijksmuseum and some pretty fancy shops. There is no designated parking for the hotel, on street parking is 36 euros for 24 hours or there is a valet service but it wasn't flexible enough for our needs. The hotel is quirky with a small reception/bar and the staff are really helpful and speak excellent English. Our room was on the 4th floor and was very small. The bed was in a cubby hole and was rather uncomfortable for both myself and my partner. It was also quite hot despite it being freezing cold outside. The breakfast was ok, lots of different breads and a selection of meats but it wasn't that appetizing and with the hotel very busy it too felt cramped.…",3
1237,"We shared a dorm with four of us all from the same party. It is basic and it is cheap. Bunk beds and you have to make your own bed. It is very central and has good transport links to the centre a short tram ride away. Breakfast is good, continental style and coffee also good. Issues raised on arrival resolved without fuss (light not working). Secure location right next to the park.",3
1238,"We had a nice stay at Hotel Rec in May 2018. Upon arrival, we were offered beverages to enjoy. The room was very small, as seems to be standard for what we have been finding in this style of hotel in various cities. Breakfast was good but not great; we particularly enjoyed relaxing on the rooftop patio near the pool while enjoying our morning meal. Nice location for our first stay in Barcelona. ",4
1239,"Nice hotel,centrally located,undergroud station very close...fitness centre and swimming pool undr renovation, but they dont tell you when you make the reservtion.I booked via intrnet directly with the hotel...they never mentioned the renovation they were undergoing sinceFEBRUARY!!!!! They dont even mention it in their website, i dont think it is fair especially when the pool and the fitness center were two of the main reasons why i book a room in this hotel",2
1240,"Contacted hotel a week before arrival for courtesy pick at PQC, which was noted on the hotel website.  Provided the flight info. and was told we have to wait for their shuttle, 2 hours, since they leave the airport at 12:30 and our flight was scheduled to land at 12:35.  Took a taxi on our own dime.  We stayed at Novo, several times in the last few years, they don't have a problem picking us up.  Check in was painful, staff were not friendly, facial expressions said they don't want to be there either.  Other European staffs were loitering at the checking desk, cut in and out of our conversations (an ""excuse me"" would be nice, but no), while we were trying to talk to their front desk colleagues.  They seems disorganized and trying to work out their internal issues while customers…",2
1241,"From the time we arrived Ishfaq greeted and welcomed us so graciously. He wanted to make sure our stay was comfortable. The hotel location is fantastic with the metro a 2 min walk away. A few feet away is the Tous Restaurant which is the #1 restaurant of 14,599 restaurants in Paris. There were people who took Uber or a taxi to get there. We loved this hotel, the amenities and definitely get a room with a balcony. We loved the views from there and enjoyed a bottle of champagne on our anniversary. ",5
1242,The hotel is very comfortable and in a great position. Reception was very helpful and friendly. Then the problems start. Breakfast is served on pre-prepared trays with no choice. There were two or three items that none of us ate and the serving staff couldn't understand our problem. In the evening we ordered  four drinks at the bar; two were wrong and one never arrived. The next morning I asked for coffee prior to breakfast twice and I didn't get it. We realised that none of the staff other than reception could speak any English (or French/Spanish/German). At the end of our stay we politely told the owner about our problems - wasted food and poor service. His response was that the food wasn't wasted because the staff would eat things left on the trays !!!! and that he couldn't…,2
1243,"The first room I got on the 1st floor was significantly below. After a formal complain I was upgraded to a 3rd room floor which was descent. I learnt that the hotel is under renovation top to bottom, so avoid 1st floor rooms at all costs.  Regardless of my room comments, this is clearly a budget hotel that has seen its best days quite some time ago. Although claiming to be 3 stars, it would be a solid 2 stars once the renovation is finished.  Breakfast is fine",2
1244,"I know this hotel is supposed to be ultra modern. However , I felt that the black room with very dark floor, black curtains and low lights were just too depressing. The corridor walls were in dark gray without any painting or poster. Even the elevators were too dark.   The dining area was pretty though. How I wish the guest rooms were as nice too. ",3
1245,As many years before I booked a room in Transamerica when visiting an annual conference. It is a great business hotel. But since last year something was different. There is a lot more traffic in Sao Paulo and on Marginal the traffic continues all night long. The single-glass windows of Transamerica do not hold the noise. Even sleeping with ear plugs was difficult. The traffic noise was overwhelming. The hotel needs to get soundproof windows.,2
1246,"This was a very nice hotel, at first we thought it was a little out the way but once we were checked in and started to walk around the area it’s wasn’t as bad as we thought,  The hotel itself was really nice and staff very friendly, take note of the traffic light system they have in the lift for breakfast, it tells you the busiest time for breakfast ",5
1247,"We loved the spacious room, the morning breakfast on the terrace (even fulfilling special requests), the grassy, open front yard, free parking right outside the hotel, good recommendations for restaurants, and genuine friendly, helpful service.  Well done!  We'd return to Hotel Pruly and recommend it to friends!",5
1248,"Spent five nights at this hotel and both my boyfriend and myself were very impressed. The hotel is modern, clean and peaceful. Pool area is perfect , while it is quite small it was very quiet in the day so we always had a lounger.  The maid service was particularly impressive; our room was often cleaned twice a day!  The location is great: five minutes from promenade/ beach in one direction and two minutes from main shopping street in other direction.  Staff were friendly and efficient and if we visit Cannes again we would definitely stay in the Hotel Victoria once again! ",5
1249,"We’ve stayed at Hotel de Varenne several years ago for 3 nights and just completed our second stay of 6 nights. The hotel is very quaint with we’ll appointed decor. It was exactly what we wanted in a classic French boutique hotel. Traditional enough to be authentic and modern enough to be comfortable. We liked the location during our first visit, but LOVED the location during our second visit. You see school children going to and coming home from school. There are at least 3 bakeries/pastry shops, a pharmacy, several ATM machines, small markets and a dozen wonderful restaurants, all within a block or two of the hotel! Walking distance to the Eiffel Tower, The Louvre, Rodin Museum, Arch de Triomphe, Napoleon’s Tomb, Orsay Museum, Scenic River Walk, Invilades Army Museum and…",5
1250,"I’m coming to Berlin very often. Always staying in this hotel and always enjoy it so much. good location, professional and kind staff. Breakfast is very tasty. The only 2 things that can be improved are to add mini bar in the room and more space for clothing",5
1251,"for a one night stay it's good not bad , the staff not friendly, bad and slow service its far from the city center and the airport,there was no good view at all, dining is not good limit kind of food .",2
1252,"Our stay was booked through an agent, who said it had 3 stars - it dosn't its a 2 star hotel. Well thats okay - but it only went downhill from there! The first day out toilet broke, and there was water everywhere. We called the reception to get them to clean up, and fix it.  Fix it they did - but clean no! There was poop and water in the corners of the bathroom, and around the toilet. Again we asked them to clean it. They didn't.  After 5 days there, it still had not been cleaned.   Beyond that episod with the toilet, I would not recommend this hotel, unless you want a ever going party. In the reception there is a party every night, and you can hear the music from the rooms (ours was the one furthest away from the reception)  Also the beds are very uncomfortable, and the safe…",1
1253,But not so special inside.  The main building was quite stunning but when they bring you next door - to your rooms - it's a whole other story.  The halls are dark and dreary as are the rooms.  Mustard color walls and carpet mixed with contemporary furnishings.  It was all comfortable and clean but not much to write home about.  It's also a bit off the beaten track so you need to uber or taxi to the main sights.,3
1254,"I enjoyed the luxury of their rooms. When I learnt on the news that their chef was in jail because he was cooking food expired more than 1 year, I almost freeked out.",2
1255,"We stayed at the gates hotel for 2 nights in July 2018. The hotel lobby is lovely, but the check-in was very slow as there was only 2 people on the desk and about 20 in the queue. The WiFi was good in our rooms and they were a fantastic size. The pool and bar area are also quite nice.   There was one problem that we had was that was 3 of staying in one of the rooms all got bed bug bites.",1
1256,"You’ll have to try hard to find a hotel more centrally located. It’s right on the main shopping drag of the city - although it’s mostly just the same high street brands that you will find in every city, globally. Hotel Zoo has a dramatic entrance, an outstandingly well-designed lobby area, and lots of touches you’d expect from a “design” hotel in this price range. The staff are always efficient and polite, although not exactly charming. We stayed for 4 nights, choosing one of the much larger rooms because we had heard that standard rooms are small. Absolutely no complaints with the bedroom: huge, spotlessly clean, and very well furnished. It was a lovely place to spend time. Downstairs in the elegant bar area, cocktails are well made. Be warned: on weekends it is clearly a “go…",4
1257,"We booked a 3 bedroom suite through booking.com.  I really wasn't expecting much because the room was cheap, but we were only staying 1 night and wanted to be close to attractions.  Carpet was disgusting, stains everywhere.  Same with the 2 chairs and couch in the living room. Cobwebs in the bedroom corner ceiling with bugs in it   I was afraid to even pull the sheets back on the bed.  It was hot when we got in the room, we figured they just started to cool off the unit prior to our arrival.  Unfortunately, the air conditioning was not working.  After a day on the town we came home to a hot room.  Tried calling management office, kept getting answering machine saying that office was open till midnight, yet I called at 10:30pm and no one answered and never got a response. …",1
1258,Fantastic hotel with wonderful staff.  Great location - walkable to everything in town.  Comfortable room and very helpful staff.  Loved the sunroom and lounge areas.  Definitely worth reserving a room with a balcony. ,5
1259,"Great central location right by CheckPoint Charlie and close to good restaurants and cafe's. Lovely staff.  Breakfast does the job of setting you up for the day. Only recommendation I would have is to arrange coffee and tea making facilities in the room; even at a the cost of the mini- bar, which i feel is surplus to requirement, as there is a great bar downstairs.",4
1260,"What made this a poor overall service was that the sheets in one of the beds was clearly not changed. There was dirt and hair in the bed and the sheets were clearly dirty, not stained. We did get the sheets switched out with new ones. The lady who was working last Sunday night was very friendly when we got there and with helping us with this issue. What really upset my wife and I was when we were leaving Tuesday morning and we were asked how everything was and we mentioned the issue all we got was "" well that's unfortunate "" and the lady that was helping us got weird like we were making it up or something. If you don't like feedback then I would appreciate if we weren't asked how our stay was. ",2

The in-room Guest Book states, ""All the Club rooms and Suites rooms have access to the exquisite Club Sofitel Lounge...From personalized express check-in to breakfast.""    We went to the Club Sofitel Lounge this morning for breakfast as promised, and we were instead asked to leave because the receptionist said it is only for ""Club"" rooms.  I explained to her, and later to the the front desk, that we were informed in writing, that it is also available to ""All...Suites rooms,"" of which we have two.  It was embarrassing to be asked to leave, in front of other guests, especially when we were expressly invited to go there in the first place.  The receptionist did nothing to fix the problem.   Otherwise the hotel is comfortable and clean.  We…",2

Complained to the front desk, and they had no idea what work was being done and when it would be completed.   Had three separate maintenance visits for a fridge/freezer that did not freeze nor made ice.  Each visit we were given excuses, with no action to either repair or replace during our three night stay, although they did bring us some ice.  This concern was brought up at check out and we were told there is nothing that could be adjusted, for the lack of a working freezer, even spoilage.  Apparently, if you have a nice location in the city, you have the right to ignore concerns brought forward from your…",1
1264,"I only stayed at the Berlin Mark for one night night, I thought the check in staff were very helpful. The hotel is ideally situated next to restaurants, and very close to Zoo station and the surrounding attractions near this. The only negative I would give is the rooms are in need of an update ! ",4
1265,"Not sure if I'm just too old or if it has to do with something else but I chose a room with just 4 people in it and thought I'd be somewhat better off this way. The squeaking noise from the beds were so loud that it is unimaginable. The loudest you could ever imagine - then multiply it by 10 and you'll get a good idea. Snoring guy that makes it impossible to sleep (not the hostel's fault of course) caused several sleepless nights.   As they say, you get what you pay for. I guess it is fine for teenagers though or people in groups/friends who share a room together and filling it up with people that they know. I understand the place seems popular though so the vast majority may be of a different opinion. Mine is highly subjective and should therefore not be taken too seriously I…",1

Mold in the shower and bathtub that doesn't seal. We were club level so at least had nice snacks & beverages. Platinum members and doesn't mean a thing here. Because of this I'm strongly thinking of changing our reservations in Tokyo to any other hotel then the one currently booked at the Ritz.",2
1267,"Location was close to the airport within 5 min. You have to pay for parking $20 per night unless you can nab some on street parking (or sidewalk in this case) which isn't too hard to do if you check in and stay in prior to about 7pm.   The room was really clean and tidy, with windows that actually open (unlike the US) even on the 4th floor. Shower was excellent.  There is a restaurant on site with a bar as well. Service was terrible and actually so rude that we got up and left after waiting for 10 minutes for anyone to even speak to us or give us menus. So no idea how the food really is.  Would stay here again, but probably will not return to Berlin for many other reasons.  We gave a 4 rating based on our experience in the restaurant/lounge.",4
1268,"I stayed here for two nights in August with my husband and two children, ages 12 and 15. We had connecting rooms. We have stayed in several hotels in Barcelona, and I would return to this one because of the value. The rooms are large and comfortable, and the bathrooms are good (the hotel supplies hair conditioner, which I appreciate). The location is central. The rooftop deck and pool area are very nice, although the area could use more loungers. Service is very friendly, particularly from the front desk staff, which provided excellent restaurant tips. The rooftop bar staff is also friendly. The room itself could have been a little bit cleaner - there were dust balls on the floor. Also the bathroom needs a towel rack (instead of a large picture). The rooms were pretty quiet,…",4
1269,The rooms were dirty and run down. There was an outdoor area but it was absolutely filthy with no table or chairs as led to believe. The pool area is dated and the spa did not work. The only bonus was the location. Would not stay here again.,2
1270,"The hotel is excellent indeed, but something that adds to this excellence is the warmth and genuineness of the working staff. Their polite ways and going out of their way to escort us to the cabs, to recommend places to eat and even to tell us how much to pay for cabs, was a warm gesture indeed.   In a place far away from home, this was indeed close to heart. Thank you ever so much",5
1271,"My first impressions of the Aressana were spectacular the foyer was wonderful and the décor – perfect.  Front desk service was a little under par and our room – ridiculous.  I was travelling with three friends and we booked and paid for a ‘family room’, however, in my opinion, we were given a ‘standard room’ that was crammed with four beds and no windows.  Whilst the main bed was lovely and spacious and had a lovely window, the two extra beds where in the ‘lounge room’ with no windows or lights and consisted of a collapsible ‘roll-away’ and a couch that had the cushions taken off and a blanket and pillow put on – we did not even get a pull-out sofa!!!  This meant we had no lounge room or couch to speak of so we either had to stand the whole time or sit on one of our friends…",3

The food is prepared hours before and left out. the pastry/ Muffins are made last week. The tables never get cleared, so you have to do it yourself. No English spoken by the staff. The location is great to get around the city as the subway is close. Went to the VIP lounge and paid RMB 210 for 2 beers and the food was finished.",2

I would not recommend this Hotel to anyone. Stay away from this Hotel.",1

My friend had been speaking Russian with others, in shops, restaurants, etc earlier in the day and I didn’t understand there may be an issue.  She said to me, in front of my friend that that she didn’t like to hear Russian; that it wasn't good to use in Latvia. I apologised and ask her to help me say it in Latvian which she did  My friend reported this to the manager who apologised   Also whilst we were sleeping, we were woken in the night by a knock on our door which was very alarming. When I asked who was there, no one replied. It was quite a scary moment ",2

1278,"This hotel has a good gym, pool and what appears to be comfortable rooms, however the rooms were so hot that it was very difficult to get any sleep.  I got moved but still the same, the staff opened the windows but it remained far to hot, my colleagues had the same problems as did other guests but when complaining I was told that this was how their guests wanted it! By contrast the reception and bar area were freezing, you needed a coat.  I thought the restaurants were expensive.

Upon speaking with a duty manager that evening about the issue again zero interest.   I was giving him all of the solutions, can we move rooms, what if it happens again etc? All they could say is ‘sorry’.  A great property, location is good but the staff interactions really ruined this property for me.   A typical American interaction really, so I shouldn’t be surprised!

I assumed we were giving permission for them to charge the credit card.  (We signed this in other places.)

When we first arrived to the room it had a unpleasant smell from the drain, it was later fixed but did not totally disappear. The bathroom is very small and the extrabed is not very comfortable. The room itself is good except for the view, facing the wall of another building. The breakfast was really good and extra plus for the sparkling wine.",4
1293,"This hotel has got very positive reviews by others. Nevertheless our experiences are different. A positive point is the location: the hotel is located in a quiet neighbourhood near Fisherman's Wharf. The negative points are:-you have to sign a kind of ''contract'' that you allow the hotel to charge your creditcard for the costs of ''any damage''. I have never seen this before. What they charge for any damage is not specified. It is a kind of blank cheque you sign. I was reluctant about this, and asked about an example. As an example they told that smoking in the room would cost 250 USD. But that is arbitrary. The hotel could also charge yu for 2500 USD! What would the loss of a towel cost? 10 USD or maybe 100? When I told that I did not like to give a kind of blank cheque the…",1

I stayed in many hotels in India, big and small, big cities small towns, luxurious and very modest, all of them had one in common, they were very clean, except this one. Bathroom was just filthy dirty, and the floor was covered with hair.  The food in restaurants was quite alright , however one of the waitress decided just to be nice or even acknowledge only my partner, to the point that he moved the chair for him completely ignoring my presence. He was keep coming to my partner making sure HE is alright, It was so awkward and embarrassing, it completely ruined our evening. Unfortunately breakfast experience wasn’t any better.

The front desk is dreadful always long queues, out of 6 desks  only 2 working, hence long queues. When we got up to the room and called down to reception nobody answered!  They where totally unconcerned I asked to speak to the hotel manager.  He has still to call me. We were eventually moved to the Park Tower. Which is very good.

As we are standing there with all of our luggage, and needing to get ready for a wedding we were going to, we were told that the River Hotel was completely booked and that there would be no place for us to stay.

In 2012, we got in late in the evening and it as it was the day before the main one, we emptied out our cases onto the bed and went straight to the rooftop bar for a cocktail to bring in our anniversary.  Every year since, we’ve celebrated our anniversary on a trip and, secondly, on every holiday since, we seek out rooftop bars. All this cocktailing is quite something for a near teetotaler like me, but it’s more about the view, which is pretty special here.  Andel’s has been taken over since our last stay. The name change to Vienna House seems to have come with an extra layer of glamour. This is one of those hotels with a huge…",5

Big design issue because one could not sit properly on the toilet, and had to manouver to get to the shower.  But - my major problem with this hotel was this:  I was sitting in bed, leaning against the headboard, and when I tried to move, it was sticky.  There was sticky stuff splashed on the headboard.

Our room had one small window looking in to the Main Street. The room was big but dark, not helped by the dark wood and brown and beige tones. Wi fi signal terrible. So, not worth the upgrade in my view. The rest of the hotel was nice however under construction whilst we were there. The bar and the tapas bar were being refurbished so closed to guests. No alternative or obvious lobby service to fill gap. The drilling was relentless throughout the day. So we could not use two of the main amenities whilst at the  hotel.

Although The Student hotel is rated as 4 stars, it is still laking some details like no amenites, no mini fridge in some of the rooms. The most unpleasant thing was that the staff allowed a very noisy party happening at one of the rooms during the night and they did nothing to stop it although me any my colleague notified the reception. It was impossible to sleep because of the noise and we had to insist to get other rooms. I would have expected a prompter reaction from the staff to solve the problem.

The hotel is extremely modern (which may be a good thing or a bad thing), very clean with well appointed, quiet guest rooms.  The staff was extremely friendly and mostly helpful.  This hotel is not located in the center of town, so if you are looking to stay at a hotel that is in the middle of it all, this is probably not the place.

No notice was given by the hotel that this was happening during my stay even though they had a letter from Yarra Trams & Melbourne Council to say this was going to be happening. Jackhammers & angle grinders commencing work at 10.30pm & running through until 5.30am made rest impossible. No block out curtains in the room I initially stayed in & was not able to change rooms immediately as they were fully booked.  Felt very exposed.

The hotel is clean, the staff is friendly and the room was of good city hotel size. We had breakfast included in our deal which was a good buffet breakfast. I couldn't fault the hotel as such but I felt that location wise it was just that little bit too far out.  Although very close to the Metro station, we personally felt that Lisbon is so safe and lovely to walk about, we didn't wanted to go underground but enjoyed to walk about whenever we could and also did so from the hotel to the city centre everyday.

1326,The room lock system was broken and I had to change my room key every 3 hours during 3 days of my stay in the hotel. Staff of the hotel never cared for my broken room lock system. My room number was 815. I will never stay in the hotel. ,1
1327,For the price I wanted to give this place a chance but I would not stay here again.  There are several reasons why.  I just returned to my room and the smell of weed in the hall and even in my room is so strong it could knock you out. The door to my room doesn’t fit correctly and there is a huge gap on the bottom and one side so all of the sounds and smells from surrounding rooms come right in.  The bathroom is dated and small and really needs an update.  The handles fall off when you try to turn the water on.  The middle knob doesn’t work correctly so you have trouble getting the shower to have any pressure at all but the tub sprays out so fast and you take a shower in 4 inches of water that’s not draining.    Everything is old so things seem dirty even though the cleaning…,1

However, only one day did I notice practices that amounted nothing more than thievery. For example, I ordered a diet coke with my meal from room service at a cost  of rs495. The exact diet coke from the mini bar was rs265. When I questioned them about this no-one was able to tell me why. The food was mediocre at best at high cost. A simple soup, for example, was rs 800.  Everywhere I turned there seemed to be staff waiting to be tipped.  On several evenings I had  one housecleaning staff member knock on my door and enter my room after telling him I did not want anything and he just stood there obviously waiting for a tip.

Its redeeming qualities are the good location in the heart of the Shanghai Silicon Valley and the low price if you are on a special rate (around $100 with breakfast). The spa and pool are excellent (if your schedule permit its use). The downside (there are many): Older and a bit run down facility. Pick up  to and from Pudong airport only works on certain hours (beware of the illegal taxis). Very slow and useless free internet throughout- even the paying internet is all but useless (the IT staff came and could not improve it) .

1330,"The room rates are very competitive and the hotel, although not likely to win any design awards, is both clean and functional.   The main draw is the location, although not in walking distance of Berlin's traditional tourist sites (Charlie, Alex and Dom) the excellent selection of bars and restaurants at either end of Emser Strasse (even before you get to the Ku'Dam) means you'll be spoilt for choice within a 10 minute walk.  The breakfast buffet is worth skipping, due to the availability of cafes near by, and the public transport directions to the hotel from Schönefeld airport on the hotel's own website are first rate even detailing how to leave the metro station and which side of the road to cross to once up the steps. Efficiency doesn’t due it justice.",4
1331,Nice hotel but the main attraction of the hotel was closed for repair. We were very disappointed that the main feature Aquarium Tank was closed and covered up for major repair. We were not informed of this before our stay. If I had been informed we would probably stayed elsewhere.  Other than that the Hotel was very well located and had great facilities. Value was very good as I paid on my Rewards Points.,4

We were able to walk to most of our sightseeing in Mitte (except for Potsdammer Platz where we took the UBahn) and the area around the hotel was funky with lots of good restaurants. This hotel is better than it looks; the decor feels like staying at the IKEA store and everything is well maintained. We arrived a couple of hours early after an overnight flight where we didn’t get any sleep. Despite the German's reputation for sticking to the rules they took pity on us and let us into the room early.

The people are friendly and helpful, but I have to give this hotel low marks for some of the basics, like the sink doesn't drain and it takes a long time to get warm water just to shave. The soap dispensers barely dispense any soap. There are no drawers for clothing, so you have to live out of your suitcase. I have a presentation tomorrow and really need an iron.

The apartments were both superb and looked like brand new to be honest. THere was nothing to want. Location is excellent - 5 min walk to trains.  Lots of local restaurants, cafes and bars and you are in the heart of Prinzlaur so there is no shortage of food and drink to enjoy.  Wonderful place to stay and so much nicer than forking out all your hard earned money to stay in a stuffy little hotel room !",5
1350,"Staff at inside apartments were exceptional. Easy to deal with, offered to book tours and activities for us, were always friendly and helpful from arranging a taxi to loaning us an umbrella, nothing was too much trouble.  The apartment was on level 2. It was clean and had everything we needed including a washing machine! The location was fantastic being right in the Born district, close to Gothic Quarter and the beach with lots of cafes, bars, shops all close by. Unfortunately that also meant party central at night and the only downside is the noise coming from people outside. The people of Barcelona never sleep at night and it was normal to hear shouting and partying at 3am.  Regardless of this, we would stay here again. It was also super handy having the inside apartment main office just downstairs. We’ve stayed at other apartments where you have to collect a key with all your luggage at a completely different location from your actual apartment which ends up resulting in double taxi fares or worse, traipsing around a foreign city with all your luggage to find your accomodation.…",4

Hotel is split into two halves which can be quite confusing especially if your driver can't understand a word that's coming out of your mouth, getting a taxi can be quite troublesome but if you've got the doorman there you needn't worry they are loud and efficient.  Experience at the front desk didn't feel very welcoming and I didn't receive my welcome gift as a golden circle member which was also disappointing. The rooms where good sized but my view was poor since I was on a very low floor possibly as I am on corporate rate? Breakfast was shocking as nearly every morning I had to queue up and even on Saturday before I departed they put me…",2

He starts to shout and scream why the hell we opened the door and started to load our luggage.  Next what happens, is something which I have never experienced.

1354,"While the hotel is in a great location it lacks in quality and upkeep. The hallways wreak of old and the rooms are extremely dated.   The rooms are extremely hot and the windows do not open. Maintenance must come and open them for you. In my case the window did not stay open so a wooden block was place to keep it open.    The first room I was given smelled of cigarettes smoke and the TV had volume but no picture. When I arrived at the front desk the second time to change rooms, I was given attitude by Fabiola the front desk clerk. When I asked for a room with a refrigerator I was told there are no rooms with refrigerators and there was a 30.00 charge to have one delivered. Since I had  already been inconvenienced a complimentary fridge would have been appreciated. Instead I was…",1
1355,"This is a typical business hotel in a huge building. The decoration in the halls is quite nice, but the rooms (even superior) are just standard. Their terrace with some artificial little lakes is quite sympa for a drink or two. To go to the city center you have to take a metro or taxi. Walking it takes around one hour. Breakfast buffet is quite rich and you have a good choice of everything. The meeting facilities are quite ok. The service varies a lot, some people were excellent, some couldn't care less. ",3
1356,"I stayed with my family for 5 nights at this hotel, and i am really happy with my choice (well, infact my wife's choice). To begin with, the location is just fantastic, i.e. just opposite to Gare de Lyon which makes almost entire Paris accessible, with plenty of nice cafes and restaurants to have good meals from. The hotel has nice gardens near by (in less than a km distance) where one can walk about in the morning across the beautiful Seine.   Now to the hotel, yes the hotel is not huge but i would say adequate and comfortable for a stay in Paris. the space limitations are well covered up by the service with a smile, and care for comfort (for eg: couple of our bulbs were not functioning, and within minutes of our check in they were proactively replaced).

On arrival we were informed we had an attic room, and they did offer to change the room. But we were tired and did not want to wait on a room being cleaned. The attic room is however disappointing. There is not a full length wardrobe, just a sliding panel in the wall that comes to about waist height. And there is only a small slit window. It was fine for two days, but vastly overpriced at 250 Euros a night. I really expected 5 star luxury, and this is at best 4 stars. Also the breakfast room is very small and the buffet rather limited compared to other hotels. The staff are on the whole very nice, and the…",3

Our room was pleasant as well. The bed was extremely comfortable and a lot better than other stays in Europe.  The only con I had was the gnocchi at their restaurant, it was poorly seasoned and didn’t have much taste.   Would definitely stay here again! Loved that view!",4

As soon as we got in the room we were overwhelmed by stink of sewage and by the terrible noise coming from the building under construction right across the wall. We asked for another room, even paying a difference, but they had nothing else available but the room right upstairs ours which we did not like as it was definitely shabbier than the first. The problem with the stink was solved but we always had to sleep with ear plugs as constructions would start every day at 7am and would go on until after 8 pm.  So if you like the sound of hammers, drills and sawing that is the place for you!

Service is top-notch and rooms are spacious, though in serious need of updated decor.  Bathrooms are exceptionally luxurious in size and finishes.

The hotel free bus is always fully booked and the staff tell you to book only to find each time it is not available and so you need to take the private taxi. The hotel grounds are beautiful but the service is poor. Each day rooms are made up poorly for a five star resort. Cups are not washed, bed linen not changed and hand towels not replaced. When you ask for something you get Ok Ok but then it either does not come or you do not get what you asked for.

No one seemed to be able to give me a straight answer to my questions and the managers refused to provide me with a refund after attempting to cancel my reservation within 72 hours of my stay.

There were a couple light bulbs in the room that were out. Some light switches did not work. A tile in the bathroom of my colleagues room fell off the wall. Carpets were pretty dirty. It kind of felt like it might have been a 5-star years ago, but no longer. The food in the restaurant was really not very good. Very little fresh fruit - just watermelon, other melon (while out on the street you could buy fresh oranges, pamalo). Place setting were set without any spoons but the buffet had cereal, yogurt.

And neither one of us require much privacy from the other. The restroom was nice and clean for the most part. I did notice a bit of mold on the tiles up closer to the ceiling where I’m guessing it’s hard to reach.

Breakfast was plentiful and of a good selection, but, hot food area need reviewing bu hotel. The way it is presented on buffet table is inadequate as there is no method to keep this food hot.

First, the hotel's strengths:  1) Reasonable price  In line with the overall affordability of Portugal relative to the rest of Western Europe, this hotel is very reasonably priced. Having booked in advance, I paid an average of EUR 75 per night. The hotel is close to the Saldanha metro station, although we relied largely on Uber as we were traveling with a stroller and it was difficult navigating the steps leading to the subway.    2) Breakfast  The buffet breakfast, when booked in advance, cost less than EUR 6 per person when breakfast.

The swimming pool is very small. Maybe better for kids but really not for adults. There is really no pool deck to hangout. There are a couple lounge chairs but it's really just bar stools and tables set up for drinks and food. Staff at the rooftop bar is not as nice as the rest and are very slow. Exercise room is great.

On the other hand, this place is missing many of the classic hostel features that we were looking for, specifically the community of other travellers looking to meet up and socialise, and a lack of evening events.  I found the staff generally unfriendly and uninterested in us, apart from one guy (black hair, comes from Alfama). Not so much as a “oh hey, where have you been exploring today” from most of the reception staff.   The rooms are good, cleaned daily, and a great size.

The floor was squeaking all the time when people walked. The walls were thin and you could hear all that happened in each floor. So snoring and love were shared with all guests. The breakfast was also under average and the dude in the bar was very rude and aggressive. Will not return to this hotel ,2

It was just one medium-sized room (with dirty bed sheets), which was not suitable for 3 people and not what we had booked. It should be noted, however, that once we called them to complain about this, we were given another apartment very…",3
1410,"We stayed in a grand deluxe room in the main building. Very quiet neighbourhood, and one can reach the Kurfürstendamm in about 10 minutes. We were happy to find a hotel with a spa and pool that is not part of the common hotel chains. We especially liked the pool area with its open windows to the small garden. The sauna was brandnew which was nice but we missed a water dispenser at the spa. Also some of the bar staff could be more attentive - e.g. bringing the bill unasked is at least impolite.  The room itself was a bit dated and had some small inattentiveness such as missing tiles and makeshift ""blinds"". The aircondition is quite noisy even when switched off. The bed was comfortable and the complementary services we quite liked, as well as the delicious cookies that came with…",4
1411,"We (two senior couples) reserved two nights and extended one night in September 2017.  I was entertaining some family and wanted a five-star experience, which Sheraton claims to be. The Good:   The hotel is lovely with contemporary decor and spacious updated rooms with large windows.  We were on the ninth floor, nice views.  Because the hotel is on Boa Vista, a main avenue, it can only be accessed from one direction, confusing at first and annoying later, but they can’t change that.  The breakfast buffet is average. The Bad:   My guests found the bed hard and in the morning requested a softer bed if possible and were immediately assured that it would not be a problem for that evening.  Upon arrival at 11pm, the bedding change had been forgotten and the couple had to wait for the…",3
1412,I was getting air BNB at similar rates in similar areas at similar costs. I booked ibiss because of breakfast options and not having to share the restroom. I was pretty satisfied. The place is close to checkpoint Charlie and topogaphy of terror making the place very close to major tourist attractions.,4
1413,"Damned  by faint praise?  We were part of effectively a coach party. When we checked in we were told that all our rooms had been upgraded but I think we missed out on that bonus judging by the adequate but unexceptional room we had.  We went to the main restaurant for breakfast but found ourselves being directed to the coach party breakfast room instead. Breakfast was, however, fine.  We have to say we were underwhelmed by the experience. We stayed at the Heritage Avenida Liberdade in 2016 which we thoroughly enjoyed and it is that much closer to the tourist centre of Lisbon. We would very happily go back there again.",3
1414,"Clean, modern and with great facilities. Lovely staff.  Very safe set-up with keycards needed to access the hotel floors.  Breakfast is basic but serviceable. Dinner is cheap and very basic- the food is simple and limited in choice but it’s most certainly edible. ",4
1415,"Do not come here anyway you risk buttons all over the body, and you risk infesting your own home with BED BUGS when you return.  I stayed at this hotel in January for a business trip to San Francisco, and I came across these bed bugs in my bed. I realized it only the next day when I saw pimples appear all over my upper body. These creatures are horrible and contaminate all your suitcases.  The hotel manager, Chris, promised me a refund of my nights, but today more than a month after my return I still have not received anything, and I was blocked on their phone.  Flee this hotel, the staff is dishonest, they made me believe it was the first time, but they were all equipped with special cream for the bed bug pimples ...

1416,"Well, I had a certificate for two free nights at the Crystal Beach, so I thought it would be a nice place for a weekend getaway. The pictures of the hotel in the brochure and on their website looked nice and clean-NOT! They are very misleading and must have been taken when the hotel first opened because they are NOTHING like the actual thing. First of all, the hotel is not in the best part of town and many of the businesses around it are closed. There are bums around the pool area and on the beach. The staff at the front desk is rude, lazy, and unhelpful. The first room we got was small and smelly with old, stained furniture and carpet. The bathroom also smelled like urine. When we went to go complain to the front desk, they said they had to send a housekeeper to see the room…",1

Shower head was broken spreading water all around and also drain didn't work at all - in 2 minutes the whole bathroom was covered in water. I called service desk and was ""surprised"" again. They were rude and didn't want to solve the problem at all. They response was ""wait until tomorrow and we will come and fix it"", and they refused to understand that we wanted to take a shower that night, before going to bed.  Only after I requested to refund for that night as I obviously wasn't  getting the full service, they…",1

The matress provided a good rest, there were free power sockets available and the window opened. Breakfast was good with plenty of options to choose from; breakfast room was also very confortable. The free WiFi worked sleamlessly. Staff was friendly but not very efficient on helping/solving problems. At arrival my prepaid room/voucher wasn't identified in their check-in system.

The incident was so ambiguous and cannot be explained in any logical way; we have come to the conclusion that there was colution by staff. Towards the end of the evening we were the only guests in the dining room. A couple walks in and sat immediately behind my wife despite the many other unoccupied tables; they looked at the menu; got up and walked out. Neither my wife nor I noticed that her handback also 'walked out' until we got up to retire to our room. The most bizarre though is that at that moment several staff appeared with the handback claiming that it was handed in at the…,2

I pulled out forty dollars and left the remaining two-hundred in the room. House keeping came in to clean the room while we were gone. When I realized I left the envelope out it was too late!!! I returned to the room and found only a clean room with no envelope or money!! We complained and told the housekeeping manager one of the room cleaners was a thief! She denied our accusation and did NOTHING to accommodate us! She claimed they have turned in one thousand dollars before what makes you think they wouldn't turn in two-hundred!! Well let's see it was there three hours before and now it's…,1

They also will pick us up in the station or airport, they have schedule for this in every 30 minutes. The another thing that I really like is their American breakfast. It is so yummy and have a lot of menus. Do I repeat for the next visit? Yes, I'll do it.",4

Pros: Great location just above the Barrio Alto,near  the Principe Real and several metro stops. Easy to get into the action of fun neighborhoods very quickly. Accomodating service- we had trouble with the noise in our first room and they switched us with no problem. Good free breakfast for the  rate- included pastries, toast, croissant, ham and cheese. Cute decor  Cons: Room 002 (our first room) was on the corner of a ground floor location, with intolerable street noise at night (drunk pedestrians, etc). Difficult to get hot water from shower.

Unfortunately I learned the opposite  just after entering the hotel at the check in. Non English speaking staff trying to check me in. This did not went well.  Getting to the room, Woww for the first impression but, there is no cloth line to dry you wet swimming trunks, a seat in the shower you can't use, no soap holder, the doors opens to the outside of the shower and the floor is wet and slippery.

The room was spacious with a fridge and a very large and very comfortable bed, I am sure that most people that do stay here will be more than happy.  Now the not so good.  We had an early flight and arrived at the hotel before 10am. We were informed that our room was not ready as book in time was at 2pm, however as we had arrived early they would try to get our room ready as soon as possible.

The fact is that there was a problem with the issue of taxes to pay for the stay in the city. The company through which I booked the hotel informs me that the hotel could apply myself taxes corresponding to each city.  It seems perfect to me that we are required to pay these taxes, I have been in many cities both in Europe and outside Europe and this is nothing new for me, but, Is there no better way to require to us the payment of these taxes that turning off our keys in the middle of the night so we could not enter to the room?

My fiance and I decided to spend 3 days in SF, and we picked this hotel because it seemed not too far from the centre but also the pictures looked good on the website.  The truth is that, not only the area is terrible, full of homeless people, drug addicts (which makes it very unsafe and uncomfortable to walk) but also the rooms and the hotel is bad. We probably got the second most expensive room which was the queen room, it was supposed to be a quiet one. The bed was extremely small, towels were dirty, carpet in the room as well. The AC was not working and we woke up in the middle of the night with a strong terrible noise from the AC. We called the reception and they changed us to another room,…",1

Walk by the halls and you see a pictures of Frank Sinatra and start to think you’re in paradise, but it’s an illusion.  Walk into the main lobby and you’re immediately taken back to the veranda of that Carnival cruise line that your parents forced you on:  think tacky people, overpriced everything, and people in pure disbelief on how they just spent their hard-earned dollars.    The hotel room isn’t bad, it’s just the awful location of it.  Because the hotel is in mid-beach you’re not away, you’re the destination for LIV nightclub in the evening.

Its always fun to walk in to an elevator with 10 drunk people and your kids.  They really should have a guest only elevator when there dance club is open.  Also real doors on the bathroom would be nice.  Great location average service.  Defiantly worry more about there club than the guests of the hotel.,1
1442,"Despite the headline, I would like to start with saying this is not a bad hotel, It just didn't match our expectations in certain area's. Anyway on with my review.  The Hotel: The resort is in a large plot in a secluded location outside of Lagos, at parts over looking a cliff facing the ocean. If  your looking for a resort close to Lagos centre, this isn't for you. You can't walk it, it's about 15 minutes drive in a taxi. Considering the remote location of the resort, it really should a mini market within the complex.

The cleaners came in everyday and remade beds, replenished towels and emptied the bins. The hotel state that all rooms have sea view however I would say some are a ""side sea view (see picture). We looked towards Lagos with the sea to the left. I would defiantly upgrade to a ""superior room"" as these have air con. We didn't and it was unbearable - especially at night.

The raw ingredients of the hotel in Lisbon are awesome and I understand that they have plans for this hotel but honestly I don’t feel it warrants the badge or honours the brand. The George V in Paris is an old hotel and perhaps not to everyone’s taste but it’s seriously classy and elegant in a timeless way but the FS Lisbon is just old and so dated.

The desk staff were efficient and courteous, the rooms clean, the breakfast food and the staff there were also lovely. It is located near the Alexa mall and other shops around Alexanderplatz. If you're in the mood and wearing good footwear, you can take a walk from the hotel to main sights like the cathedral, Bebelplatz and even the Brandenburg gate. My only comment is that if you are a light sleeper, a room at the front of the building might not be right for you due to the noise from the traffic. ",5
1467,My room had no windows - which turns out to be really odd. The room and hotel decor is funky and smart but the lack of window made for an odd vibe. I found never knowing when the sun rises or falls tonne really disorientating. Plus the heating system is hard to moderate and it's hard not being able to get any fresh air.   I would suggest getting breakfast elsewhere if you can. It's a very limited range. Small plates of small amounts of food.

Montparnasse station is also a short walk away.  On check-in, I was offered a drink and was checked-in by a friendly receptionist.  There is only a small lift, but it was modern and adequate.  The room are decorated in a shabby chic manner, and the price point (around GBP 90/night) was very reasonable given the excellent location and the fact that the rooms were clean, relatively spacious (for Paris) and well-decorated.  The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was a good size (not too tiny, as is the case with many European bathrooms).  The hotel looked like it had been renovated recently, and the wood flooring…",5
1471,We stayed at this hotel 3 times during the month of August 2019 as a base while we travelled to other European countries. Great location and friendly staff.  If you are looking for a room with a view you might as well look elsewhere. View from all directions is not good.  House keeping could most certainly could use improvement. Even after we complained the improvements were small. All other services were on par with what was promised. French restaurant in the lobby was a treat. Will stay there again!,4
1472,"We stayed here for 5 nights and upgraded to a superior room. Although the room was nice I would not class it as superior and I am not sure it was worth the extra money. The room had a doulbe and a day bed so could accommodate three people, it had a long narrow balcony which was set back from those around it, faced north east so did not get any direct sun all day and was overlooked by the stairs going up to the two adjoining properties, this was dissapointing. The superior rooms are noted as having bath robes, fireplace, shower gel and free local calls, we did not get any of these although we did get soap and have a phone socket but no phone, not big issues but the robes and fireplace would have been nice, especially as it got very cold in the evenings. The balcony light did not…",3

Rooms are bleak and a bit depressing (no colour) cheaply fitted out, (wash basin wont drain out) and on three days received no fresh towels. The spa and pool are privately run (not the hotel) and so  not free and cost an exhorbitant euro 9 a day which is a bit of a swizz for hotel guests. This should be made clear on the website when booking!! Also the stupid rule of forcing all pool users to wear silly rubber caps is offputting. We avoided the spa and pool from thence on.

Then the boozing at night was really nerve wrecking. No respect for the guests whatsoever. They were all intoxicated, a bunch of drunks drinking vodka like water. Most travelers mistake a hostel for a pub or a night club. The reason people go to a hostel is for accommodation, meaning that getting rest is what people come to the hostel for, not to party and keep everyone awake all night. The WC was all dirty, paper all over the floor, long waiting time to use the shower, the dorm was very noisy and lacked adequate ventilation. Close to main attractions in Plaza Serrano, but…",2

The carpets are filthy with all sorts of stains - yellow, brown, green... The decor is very cheap and outdated - it looks like Ikea stuff from 1980s. The bathroom has mold all around the corners, so they periodically put ridiculous think beads of caulk to hide the filth. As a result, you have already molding thick white caulk on the brown tile. And we stayed in supposedly ""upgraded"" room since we are SPG Gold. I can only imagine what a ""regular"" room would be like. On the last day of our first stay a worker walked in our room, said something in Chinese and proceeded to the minibar. We were having lunch in our…",2

The lobby was spectacular in appearance although dated and somewhat unkept.  Reminded me of the lobby of at the Tower of Terror at DisneyWorld in Orlando.

LOTS of locals walk right in and use the pool and the 1 lousy hot tub for adults. None of the staff seemed to care about non guests out there using the facilities that we paid for.  Pro tip,  we paid for a room on the 6th floor(concierge level) it costs extra but what we learned from watching people is you can access the 6th floor from the stairs from other floors and get the free breakfast, snacks etc.. that are supposed to only be for the 6th floor guests but the employees don`t care or pay attention.",2

They even have a night eye cream in the bathroom and a pillow mist to help you sleep well. How neat is that?! The bed is very comfortable and they even provided extra pillows in the room before I even checked in. Great service all throughout my stay!  Breakfast is adequate. It gets crowded after 8am and you may have to wait to find a table, so go early. There is a decent selection of hot breakfast items, cheese, fruit, and pastries.

The wi-fi free in the Sheraton was at the Hilton a chargeable commodity unless you wanted to be confined to the lobby, the signal strength was unreliable at the best even the paid day rte was no better, staff were helpful, location was poor for sightseeing although taxis are cheap.  Breakfast was very good, the Atrium restaurant food at night varied from good to mediocre  Value for money I would suggest that unless you have a deal or special offer, avoid, there are better at a cheaper price.",2

I have stayed twice since Mr Lu 9(i believe that is his correct  name)the new manager  took over and he incorrectly booked our 5 rooms both times.

We did request early check-in for around 9am which we didn't think would even be possible but we decided to indicate it on the survey anyway. To our surprise and delight, a room was made available for us even at such an early hour. Also, instead of housekeeping knocking on our door, they actually phoned the room! That was a pleasant difference from other hotels, and much appreciated.",5

The actual apartment consisted of 2 single beds and one double bed both separated from the living areas by sliding doors. There was a large pull out sofa bed in the living area, but I think it would have been cramped with 6 adults in the apartment! Kitchen was well equipped for the stay and we loved the fresh orange juice squeezer- we used it every morning.  In regard to noise I am usually very fussy and was concerned after reading some of the commments here.

This journey costs just over 3 euros and takes around 40 minutes.  Tickets are available from machines in the airport station but you must validate them in the machine next to the ticket dispenser.  The hotel is about a 5 minute stroll from the U bahn station.  The hotel itself is welcoming, bright and airy.  It has a bar attached and a restaurant on the first floor where breakfast is served.

Try asking them a question and they automatically look around for a colleague for you to ask instead.

Our flight arrived on time and after one hour had cleared passport control and collected bags. When we walked out and looked for our driver but there was no one from Pullman to be seen. We walked around for 20 minutes and couldn't see anyone. We then had to buy a local SIM card and called the hotel. Only after speaking to the concierge and waiting a further 10 minutes did our driver come rushing in. Not a great start......

1496,"My dog and I stayed at the Citadines for a week during a heat wave in July so I could work on my dissertation in aircon. We had a studio which had a main room with a large bed (that can be split), a bench at the end of the bed, a large desk with chair plus an extra chair. There was also a kitchenette, washroom with shower/bath combo, and separate toilet. The main room and the others were separated by a door that could be left open or closed. This was a great feature, especially with a dog to block out any extra noise (or smells from the kitchen). Everything was in working order and clean. AC was great! The design was simple but relaxing, I loved the blue accents. The hotel is located just north of the busy area of Cannes, but a short 5-10 min walk away. This allowed for a peaceful stay. There are two regular groceries and 2 bio groceries within 3 min walk of the place as well as some small restaurants with nice service and food.  This is a hotel where they leave you mostly to yourself besides greeting and looking out for safety. The staff is helpful and advice and is friendly. The one issue that came up is that they don’t tell you what day or time your weekly cleaning is. This ended up a bit awkward as the housekeeper came when I was in the middle of a project in my pajamas haha. She gave me max 2 mins to pull things together, I’d appreciate even just a note in the morning that it was cleaning day. They do have a nice lounge with AC and outdoor patio to relax or work at. …",5
1497,What greets you is a friendly and very well informed front of house staff. Nothing was about problem. The hotel itself is a clean and well run afair but very much no thrills. I wouldn't say boutique.  The rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable.  The location is great too as very easy to walk to both underground and overground trains and out of the main hustle of the centre and surrounded by great restaurants.  Train tickets can be bought at reception as there is no bar aswell as train tickets.  They offer a laundry service which is very reasonable.  The only downside is that the free WiFi is terrible and drops constantly but not the end of the world.  I would thoroughly recommend this friendly comfortable hotel! ,4

While the public spaces and pool area are beautiful and clean, the hotel rooms were not so much.

The curtains do not block out the light, the internet does not work and there are only bedside lights so the room is dark. We are on Market Street which is noisy.

The staff were friendly and the hotel was a quick walk to the beach, what was a plus. When we went down for breakfast they were still setting up even though it should have been open for 15 minutes, so left and came back. They had a great choice and food looked good until we went to eat it, it was just warm at best if not cold. So much potential just needs a bit of love.",2

There was a safe in the room and good free wi-fi throughout the hotel.  The only downside was that there was no wardrobe for hanging clothes but there were coat hangers on a bar on the wall that were sufficient for our purposes.  Reception staff spoke good English and were very helpful.  There was a good selection of hot and cold food on the buffet breakfast.  The hotel is situated on the main bus route between Zoologischer Garten and Alexanderplatz (100) and Wittenburgplatz U-Bahn station is a few minutes walk away so most of the main tourist sites of the city are within easy reach.,4

It has the WOW factor when you walk into the reception area and you can see right away why it is a 4 star accommodation.   Check-in was swift and we were given a room on the third floor. Big, clean, a fridge, big king-sized bed (may even have been a queen size), powerful shower, good amount of hanging space, tea and coffee making facilities. Basically, everything you want from a room for the weekend.  The small bar and breakfast areas are also really nice, although when the restaurant is busy in the mornings for breakfast, you may have to sit next to a stranger due to the way they have the tables set up.  On the subject of breakfast, this is where my deduction…",4
1526,Stayed here last year.  Bill was settles upon leaving but unauthorised credit card charges were taken from my account on Friday 17th June.  Hotel was ok and in decent location and air con little noisy.  Found staff reasonably helpful while we stayed but follow up queries to mysterious charges have been ignored.  Very disappointed with this level of service as they responded instantly to my email wishing to pay prior to my stay.  I would advise paying cash at the desk only to avoid my issues,1
1527,"I love this hotel nice place you can work all day, and at night is funny you can play billiard and lisining to music or driking with friends, also you can try the Ice Kube Comfortable room, clean, airy and perfectly lit. Exceptional service and professional staff. The location of the hotel made my stay more than pleasant.",5
1528,Difficulty with front desk staff at check-in although all accommodations were confirmed and prearranged. Construction at the hotel was not managed well.  Elevators were broken or malfunctioning. WIFIi in guest rooms was horrible or nonexistent. While I can appreciate the historic value of the building the owners and staff need to better maintain the building and manage the comfort of it's guests more attentively. ,1
1529,"I stayed there for 5 days/4 nights on business. I checked in, I was not informed of any of the hotel amenities. The in-room dining selection was very poor - there were only FOUR dinner options, one of them was a green salad. The breakfast selection was similar in only four options. My towels were threadbare/had quarter-sized holes in them. So did the replacement towels they brought me! My sheets were dirty on check-in & had a shoe print! I called to have them changed, no one showed up so I BOUGHT my own. I went to the lounge with a colleague to eat, we asked for a menu FOUR times & never got one so we paid for our drinks and went to eat somewhere else. The bellmen/concierge/valets were excellent though. Their only redeeming quality at the hotel. ",1
1530,I booked a room via their website. Nobody warned me that it is not four star room - I will be generous to give it two stars.  the hotel however had no problem to charge me for four stars. It was on the ground floor with a viwe on a wall. It had a Tv set and a hair-drier. if you want to have an electric kettle you have to pay extra 3 euro per day. The furniture was worn out and dirty. Nothing but cheap soap and a strange shampoo in the bath. It was terribly cold inside the bath and room. I couldn't switch the air-conditioning off. It looked completely different in the photos they provide in their website. Cannot recommend it to anyone. Keep away from this place.,2
1531,"Loved staying at the Hotel De Varenne. Great location on the Left Bank, 12 minute walk to Musee d'Orsay. Street was quiet but with plenty of bakeries, fruit and vegetables stores and small groceries. Room was comfortable with separate and private bathroom. Shower was part of the tub, which was great. Small but perfectly fine elevator. Receptionists were friendly and helpful. Cooler refrigerator was helpful for water and fruit. Highly recommend. Lovely courtyard. ",5
1532,"I contacted the hotel before arrival 1 WEEK, and asked if we would be able to check in early. They said that it would not be a problem. When we arrived 10:30 am I messaged the hotel and advised we were on out way from the airport. Arrived at 11:15 am and the room was not ready. When Checking in I was not able to check in early. I sent a message ahead of time and the room was still was not ready. The guest service agent was not very accommodating and could care less kept saying over and over that it’s sold out. We stay a lot with this brand and have never had issues as such as the customer service was not accommodating nor was she helpful in trying to make things move faster. She would not allow anything and kept saying over and over that the check in time was 3:00 pm. (Evelyn)…",1
1533,"Not worth the price, they nickel and dime you for everything.  The valet didn't ask if we need helps with our bags and then he left our car just sitting there. The room service is terrible over priced and slow.  I was told on more than one occasion that they can't do there job because they're busy.  I was woke up by calls about the tray for the food multiple times after I told them we were not done with it. There was no water bottles in the room the tv didn't allow HDMI connection so your forced to buy movies and the selection is terrible.",2
1534,"The cruise company booked this hotel, and I was very pleased. I loved the breakfast!  I thought the room was very attractive and comfortable, and had enough outlets for recharging.  My one complaint was the room was on a low floor looking out on a roof covered with grass/weeds and big ugly birds, so I closed the drapes for the rest of the stay. The location is a mile or so away from tourist attractions, so it's easy to get in your 10,000 steps while sightseeing. The walk through the quiet neighborhood isn't bad. It is between areas in my pocket tourist guide, so off the map.  There is a good Italian restaurant a couple of blocks behind the hotel if you care to venture out.",4
1535,"Travelled as a group, six of us, ranging ages 8 to 88! Beach not as advertised - stony and dirty and ugly Hotel I would say is average just about 4 star but a few things let it down. We went for all inclusive - no need for premium as there were plenty of sun beds and one visit to the a la Carte restaurant was enough, it’s not that impressive. Food overall was disappointing particularly the fish, very bland and repetitive would have liked more fresh produce.Breakfast was best. Drinks ok but cocktails a definite miss as they were remade in jugs. Rooms were ok but not enough hanging space and be careful there are ants everywhere. Water pressure in shower also not the greatest. Entertainment was nothing special, best night was the FolkLore. Activities felt like they were winding…",3
1536,"Outwardly, this place looks attractive,but once you get past the friendly front desk staff, the shine starts to fade. The first thing I noticed was the total lack of air conditioning. Thankfully it was December but even so, the rooms were hot for us and several others we met on a variety of floors in the hotel. The lack of a top sheet on the bed didn’t help ( I’m told that is trendy, but I like a light cover at night, and the bedspread just makes you sweat more). Not to worry though, the bed isn’t really comfortable enough to sleep on, so you’ll be awake anyway. Replenishing your coffee pods, minibar, and turndown service are all nonexistent. The Nobu restaurant does have high quality food and service, but even for South Beach, you’re paying a premium for it. Same for the bar,…",1
1537,"Exceptional service from everyone at the hotel... truly felt like we were home and the room was adorable and comfortable for Paris standards! Thank you to Valerie, Soomla, and Carla and NADIM for making our stay exceptional and always being so attentive... you guys made this one of the best trips of my life!!! The location is perfect as well!!!",5
1538,We stayed for one night and we enjoyed it thoroughly. Although for the price we expected  more attention to detail like other hotels of each kind do and for almost half the price. The room was amazing and the bed was a dream in the grotto....the outdoor hot tub was excellent and we watched the sunset from our hot tub which was amazing! I just think the hotel needs some fine tuning so it can deliver better satisfaction and maintain returning customers.,3
1539,"I stayed at this hotel for a 3 Night stay. Hotel is okay, but nothing more. Rooms are spacious, but could use an upgrade, wifi works well, breakfast okay with lots of choises. Friendly staff! Easy access to airport, a bit far away from ""Down town"", but easy access to taxis. I would recommend this hotel for business!",3
1540,"My week's stay was for sight-seeing in the heart of Paris.  The hotel's proximity to the St. Paul Metro station gives quick access to the major museums, churches, and tourist sites along the river.  Numerous cafes near the hotel are a convenience, and there were numerous shops and galleries in the area, although that was not a point of interest for me. The hotel desk clerks were very helpful for travel advice, and a variety of city maps are provided.  The hotel breakfast has a good variety of choices.  This hotel is certainly worthy of its 3 star rating with a plus!",5
1541,"Dingy room, broken furniture, broken power points, dirty bathroom.Its not the best place to stay if you are visiting Chicago. A whole lot of stuff was broken and the room I stayed didn't have enough lightings.",1
1542,"Not enough value for your money. The hotel is fresh and looks partly renovated but why are all the hallways, stairs and public areas so dark?! Who decided to put a black floor in the rooms and paint the walls in depressing grey colour? Bad lightning on top of that didnt help. Hyper small bathroom with no space for stuff. Also, location is not the best, quite far from central part of the city so you need to walk or take the tram to find restaurants. I just expected much more for my 200EUR/night stay.",3
1543,"I have a list of items for supporting the bad rate: 1- it is too noise: about 5am the employees were talking loudly in the back door of the trim 2- front desk not friendly 3- cleaning is not something they care off, the shower was very dirty 4- they will charge you a “resort fee” doesn’t matter if you use it or not 5- what they call as “resort” is an old pool and not relaxing area  In a few words: noise, dirty, unfriendly and expensive for what the hotel offers to you  Definitely I wouldn’t recommend it either for my worst enemy!!!",1
1544,"we stayed there in buenos aires for one week,the place is really cute,palermo is the nicest location in the city,but as regards the hotel...rooms are big enough but the cleaning is too bad.there were two days that we wanted to go to the pool and was closed,we ask in the front desk and all they could say was: ''there is no lifeguard right now,so we cannot open it'',so why the hell you pay for a hotel with pool?? There were some guys at the front desk that were really rude with us and made fun of us! how could this be possible? just two of them were kind and helped us.in my opinion i would not recommend it to anyone.",2
1545,"Positive: well equipped kitchen with all tools, salt and pepper and towels. Excellent position for trains and metro. Negative: unknown strange smell (like of damp, probably from the dishwasher) in the room. Also they could change bathroom towels more often and get you more soap.   Overall it is 7/10 for me.",3
1546,"The double bed was two singles side by side, which I fell in between during the night. No problem getting a room change after that. Never ate here as I saw two dogs being walked on leads in from the street through the restaurant",3
1547,"The hotel is undergoing a refurbishment , some of the rooms are completed but a lot are very old and tired. The main refurbishment starts in January till August. Hopefully some of the dated public areas will be up graded to. The lifts , if all working, are slow and you need 2 lifts to get to some rooms, or down to the sea. The lobby has loose covers on the furniture! This hotel is supposed to be 5 Star sadly not. It is in a great location, close to town and with sea access, in all a disappointing stay.",3
1548,"We were at the front of the hotel - but were not disturbed by the building work; in fact we did not realise work was going on until we opened the balcony door.  We did not drink the coffee pods, because we were really surprised to have to pay for replacements and it was easy to go out for drinks.  Have not given this attractive 5 star hotel 5 stars because the glass bathroom door was so heavy and difficult to use - and we got stuck in the lift.  You use your room card to get the lift to go up - but someone in the hotel had not programmed our cards for the number of days we were staying (4).  Once the lift door shut on me, I was in total darkness, and I had to find the torch on my phone to find the emergency button - which was not lit, nor would the door open.  At that point my…",3

1550,Arrived around 6pm - hotel feels dated and room similar - got to pool around 6.40 to be told pool and beach are closing also bars so couldn’t get a cocktail - ridiculous...  Very over priced - you better have your bank manager on speed dial!  Back at beach next day - sane thing - kicked off sunbeds at 6.30 - bar beach pool closing...most people not happy that we spoke to  Finally paid the bill however they took about $400 too much and still waiting to get money back - read similar review so makes you wonder if they prey on people that don’t check their bank....  Would I go back:  No!,1
1551,"I've stayed here numerous times and always a good experience.  The rooms are comfortable, clean and well designed. The sound-proofing is excellent so no noise from adjoining rooms.  Reception staff are excellent. They actually bother to read special requests on a booking form and do their best to satisfy them. So rare these days - most hotels just ignore them. The cafe/bar/lounge is convenient and prices reasonable. It's quite a relaxing place to sit and chat.  Only slight negatives are the rooms would benefit from tea/coffee facilities and the buffet breakfast is a bit basic but adequate.  Overall, I really like this hotel. Thanks to their staff for being such good hosts and making my new year trip memorable ",5

1553,"First of all, it’s in the middle of nowhere.  But we knew that, and we were okay with it, as we weren’t planning on going anywhere, but our plan was to do a staycation.  The summary of this hotel is “short of staff”.  We made a reservation on the club floor, but there weren’t enough staff to check in, clean the tables, or replenish drinks.  The check out process took 45minutes, and they also made a mistake in the bill.  There were people behind me, who got really pissed off from waiting as there was only one person manning the check out counter, and they all went down to the 1st floor to do the process.  But of course, the main front desk on the 1st floor also had a ton of people waiting in line. The pool and gym are nice, but again, not enough staff to maintain the number of…",2

The internet was not free, so I just used my mobile o2 roaming data. The mini kitchenette is very small not ideal if there are more than 2 of you eating in most of the time.  The room was a good size (2 adults and 1 child) nice view from balcony which had sun most of the day as it was south facing, but it did get very warm in the room as there is no A/C. At night was quiet most of the time, beds a little hard but I was so tired from walking I slept like a log. Not much really modern about the rooms really.  The pool was not really child friendly and was smaller than it looked on the pictures, but…",3

The first day at the breakfast area we asked an employee if our room includes breakfast too! She kindly said yes, and after we finished having our breakfast, they brought us the receipt to sign. We asked why we needed to sign, since breakfast was included and they replied that we need to sign, in order for them to deduct the amount from our final bill at the check out. Therefore we took our breakfast there everyday.  Our stay was very pleasant, service was good, hotel grounds were beautiful.  Until the time of check out that we got extremely disappointed.  In the analytic bill the last three nights…",1

Impossible to explain anything.  There was no hot water in the shower,  and every time I had to call them,  it took about half an hour to fix...  Not good value for money ",2

Staff were unhelpful and not really interested in us throughout our stay.First night there was building works with a pneumatic drill above our room or close by complained several times to be told they are working to get issue stopped . But midnight and still like living in building site eventually got moved having to pack up and move 2 young children at 12am is not exactly what you want .But good old hotel staff offered me £50 off my bill and that's all they thought I was entitled to !! Hotel is dated but to be fair clean .Staff not helpful or maybe prefer to help Chinese guests . One night asked to get taxi arranged and after sitting 20 mins been told they could not !!! ",2

There is no elevator, so if you have a hard time with stairs, be sure to tell them when you book.  Breakfast is a traditional French breakfast of juice, coffee, and croissants.  However if you want a bigger breakfast (or in my case pain au chocolate) there are many cafes in the area that can accomodate you😊 We would definitely stay here again.",5

This Holiday Inn is a new property, sitting right next to the best preserved bit of wall on the East side. It is situated in an area of redevelopment next to the Mercedes Benz Arena. The rail network is a five minute walk away. As this is a brand new property everything is very modern and efficient. Parking on site is 15 euro a day in a secure well lit underground car park which is accessed directly from reception. I had a dinner and a breakfast both of which were excellent. The…",4
1561,Room was very quiet and we had a nice balcony with a great view.  This hotel is well located to many different sights and is located in a wonderful district with lots of restaurants.

1563,Stayed at the Vintage Hotel & Spa for four nights in April. We booked this five star hotel on three main criteria: Spa facilities; roof top bar; location. We were therefore disappointed on arrival to discover that we only had access to the Spa between 8-10am and 2-4pm. Access at other times was €20 per person per day. This was not clear on their website or via the booking company process. The hotel management should reconsider this policy as normally guests have access to the Spa facilities with only treatments etc. at additional cost. We were also disappointed to discover that the roof top bar was being refurbished when we were there. The central location was though good (walkable distance to main areas and the bairro alto district). The room (superior) was extremely basic and…,3
1564,"Ok, so when you first enter the hotel there is so much potential. The reception and restaurant all looking fresh and modern. The peeps behind reception really friendly. Elevators give the rest of the hotel away... old and dated is what I would use. The rooms still use a key and the interior is old and dated. They are clean tho so that's a bonus. Food here is very bland and not much of a selection to be honest. I went all inclusive and was expecting to be able to get food when I wanted but they stop at certain times and then start again. This is rather annoying especially if you've been out for the day and want something a bit earlier than dinner that starts at 7. Rooms provide a kettle and cups but no tea or coffee. Strange... but true... there is a safe in the room but you have…",3

The TV did not have even ONE single english channel out of 60. Room,while clean ,was rather shabbily maintained with paint peeling off in the corners and hot water taking about 10 min to start flowing.

The staff was very helpful and friendly.  The windows include encased black out shades controlled from bedside and they completely block out any noise from the train across the street.  Just around the corner on Rue Lecourbe are markets and restaurants, there is an ATM at the corner near the hotel.  We didn't have breakfast at the hotel.  We originally only booked one night, but stayed 2 more because we liked it so much!  We would've stayed for the whole trip, but they were booked.  Our next hotel was nice, but didn't compare to Hotel Vic Eiffel.",5

Upon check in our room was available early and they upgraded us to a deluxe suite. This was essentially an apartment with two bathrooms a master bedroom and living room. Everything was automated using an IPad device from the lights, curtains, TVs, and even the awning outside. The staff was incredible and was available for every possible need to ensure you had a fantastic stay. We even had a tour of the Eiffel tour canceled but Max the concierge was able to quickly book us new tickets.

If you're a big g person or have some problems with stairs then definitely stay out of this hotel. Why wasn't my experience there pleasant? My room's location was awful room 214 it's located underground with a backstreet view, things get noisy really early in the morning even if you apply the shutters and since the room is overlooking some sort of a back ally you get some drunken people talking loudly on a Saturday night you feel like they're in your room my wife woke up several times because of that. Staff was nice.  ",3
1569,"We chose the hotel as we were touring northern portugal and the availability of parking, parking was good and a fair rate. The hotel itself is a little way from the center and the ribeira, but then we knew when we booked. The area the hotel is in is mixed, I think it was a business/ office complex with the hotel, but the office looked largely empty and this sadly does let the hotel down.  The staff were very friendly and helpful at checkin, No complaints over breakfast - a good wide selection. The communal areas of the hotel are very nice, the bedrooms are perfectly adequate, not luxurious, but clean if a little tired.   The pool area was nice and the hotel offers good reviews from the rooms. I would score this hotel as better than average - good - but not very good.",3
1570,I will start this review with all the good things and say that this could have been a five star experience for us and that the hotel has great potential.   The location is great about 2 km from the city center wich is a 20 min walk or a 10 min bicycle ride. For Thos who wants to take the tram its located about 150 m from the hotel and will take you to the city in about 6 minutes.  Next to the hotel is a wonderful food hall with lots and lots of great places to eat and drink. You also have a movie theater next door if you feel like watching a movie. Parking on the street is very expensive at 3 € per hour and even though the nice new garage under the hotel is expensive at 30 € per 24 h its still your best option if you arrive by car. Just remember that the machine when you drive…,3

The location is the best, 2 minute walking distance from Fira center, with plenty of parking spaces if you consider to rent a car.

It was very quiet, we were the only users of the steam room and jacuzzi when we were there and only one person used the gym at the same time as me.  Negatives:  the sauna wasn't working at all and the room was small.  There was a bar on the top floor but it was deserted.

Also the reviews showed mostly great ones, which I now suspect were not true. Lots of the comments on the bad reviews were not available, and I strongly think they were deleted by booking.com.

The Ugly: We arrived on March 12th to find the road closed in front of the hotel due to a parade. As a result we ended up dragging our luggage 3 blocks through a huge crowd to get to the hotel.

1582,"We spent 3 nights at the vic eiffel. The rooms were clean and equipped with all the necessities. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  We don't speak French, but we're able to communicate as most of the staff spoke English.  They allowed us to store our luggage prior to check in as well as when we checked out. They all worked so well together  (a real team effort ) We will stay here on our next visit.",5
1583,"The staff all smiles and tried to help throughout, the service is poor not for lack of trying but because of a lack of leadership and management.... As simple as that. This place needs care and attention... So many things went wrong, from day one, on our late arrival on a dark rainy evening, the door man stood by with umbrella in hand as we struggled to get out of the car in sweeping rain-he Spring to attention when I told him to get his umbrella and do his job! The restaurant brasserie desperately needs a chef. Be very careful of the room, our first room had low ceilings, the next beams which I'd bump into at night and during the day! When we finally saw a room we like they have it to us and charged us 50% more, we were too tired to argue. They booked us to have lunch at a…",3
1584,"The hotel was clean, the bathroom and shower were in separate rooms, the staff was polite and helpful. The breakfast is worthy of a separate mentioning, a good spread of traditional hotel breakfast regulars, with a german-touch. The room was properly cleaned every day, the only small note was that the drinking glasses were not cleaned properly. Also worth mentioning is that the water from the hotel's tap was not good for drinking, it had a strong earthy taste. ",4
1585,After 4 years of staying over 60 nights. Never had an upgrade or early/late checkout. This would have to be the worst loyality programme ever. Absolutely no recognition for being loyal. Time to reconsider where to stay,2
1586,I stayed here because of the location.  The front desk woman was VERY rude but I tolerated her because I was excited for my trip.  The super pleasant man in the restaurant made up for her attitude.  He was very welcoming and his smile was contagious.  The room had a funny smell but was seemingly clean. The bathroom was newly remodeled but the room itself was not. The breakfast was 5/10. Fresh fruit and pastries... nothing special.  The location makes up for the averageness of the hotel.  Walking distance to restaurants and an incredible view from the roof.,3
1587,"6/10  Good location, quite comfortable beds but very small for singles, but overall a nice room with high ceilings.  Could have scored higher (7) if they offered better late checkouts, which was needed for the disturbance (very loud banging in the room above)  but also helps with late flights etc.   Did not get the breakfast  For a score of 8/10 I was expecting better as stayed at many 6 rated and 7 rated that was just as good if not better, but this hotel is still a good hotel.",3

However the toilet got weird smell coming out from the DRain and the room is too hot till I need to open window.... just location is B not bad . Paying for Rmb 1099 per night ,can't sleep well really feel not worthy..... the hotel is veryold....strongly not recommend this hotel. ",2
1589,Senior Citizens/Care providers  beware of the unfriendly treatment of seniors with Alzheimer’s disease.  My parents were scheduled to attend the sales tour of Wyndham Grand Collection however on that morning my father who suffers from Alzheimer’s wasn’t feeling his self on that day. My mother went & I stayed back to care for my father. She was unable to attend the presentation without  him. I had to get him dress & when we got to the presentation they said he was too late to attend. The manager on site would not accommodate our request to attend the sales tour. We were rescheduled to another day. If you have aging parents this may not be an option for the caregiver to consider for them to attend due to illness. I couldn’t believe they were not accommodating. They did not add…,1
1590,"We had a terrific time at this adorable boutique hotel just across from the Jardin du Luxembourg!  The front desk was so very helpful to travelers, the teeny elevator was adorable, the lobby most welcoming in a very French way.  Our three nights were part of a Delta Vacation package our travel agent put together, otherwise we'd have never known about the place.  The hotel is a half hour RER train ride from Charles de Gaulle airport, easy to get to.  Breakfast buffet had it all in spades, and the restaurant had great burgers.  Really, we had such a wonderful time staying here!",5
1591,On arriving here we were greeted with Cava a nice starter. The roof top bar was delightful with a great view. The only hing was that gin was super expensive €15 with tonic but other spirits €8_9 didn’t make sense. Our rooms were comfortable clean and functional.The bathroom looked great but the shower leaked all over the floor no matter what we did to prevent it. The rooms are nice and quiet too.the breakfast was good with a cooked menu which food from it was beautifully presented.,4
1592,"The hotel staff was very helpful and pleasant. The bar restaurant had very nice food and the sushi was excellent. The room itself, was incredibly dated and the bathroom felt like it belonged in a hospital or other institution. This is DEFINITELY not what I expect from Four Seasons and I've stayed at Four Seasons all over the world. The rooms need a MAJOR overhaul. The rates are quite high and definitely not in line with the room quality. That said, the location is nice and, as I said, the staff is pleasant.",3
1593,"Where do I even start?  I honestly don't know how they are still in business, with their lack of professionalism and their awful service!  They gave us a room, and there was construction at 7-8am literally right outside of our window, not a far distant construction noise, but they were literally tearing the walls down from our window (as shown in the pic)  When I called to complain, the concierge told me they would send someone up to check on the issue, that never happened!  Called back several times and they did absolutely nothing, eventually they told me, well constructions are allowed between the hours of 8am-6pm!

An hour later they gave me the key. Staff members then proceeded to interrupt me three times in the next hour (refilling the fridge, checking if the room had been cleaned properly, and I did not answer the third time). The room itself was not very sound proof. Whenever the hotel staff came by, I would hear their service door slam shut. And every night the people next door ordered room service at 11:00 pm. When they rang their doorbell, it was just as loud as the bell in my room. Loved the view and steak from the hotel on the 45th floor. The other restaurant on the first floor was okay. The special rate for breakfast…",2

So I don't know whether to believe the bark or the tail here, in terms of this reflecting on the brand or just being a couple of bad apples that evening whose attitudes, nevertheless,  permanently pre-empted further consideration of that specific hotel.",1
1596,"Great hotel with clean modern décor & friendly helpful staff. WiFi in foyer only but very quick & free so did the job. Close to all main city sights , average 10 mins stroll to mall or shopping street , as well as hop on/off tourist bus. Breakfast had a huge variety but at 18 euro fairly costly as Berlin was reasonably inexpensive ( 2 coffee & 2 croissants in nearby bakery 4.50 euro total). Would highly recommend this hotel",5
1597,"All staff throughout the hotel were very friendly and helpful whether with in-house requests or directions around town. We were able to check in early, but I think the view we requested upon reserving suffered in that we were not as high up as we thought we would be. You need to be above the 4th floor to get a really good view of La Sagrada Familia. Bed and room were comfortable and bathroom was ample. ",4

LOVED the breakfast -be sure to get this as part of your package.  Staff were excellent and knew us by name after a few days.  They recommended great little restaurants.   ,4
1601,"Simply a beautiful hotel in the heart of Paris in a lovely quiet yet in a most convenient location. If one wants to experience the serenity in a beautiful room and location - choose this one. I had a most lovely room and bathroom that were spotless and modern with everything I needed. The lovely big French window, the voile curtains, the calming colours, the lovely framed pictures, mirrors and the most comfortable white bed with the calming runner made my stay the perfect one ever - I did not want to leave the hotel and just stay in the room. I sat next to the big French window and see the Parisienne lives go by! The staff (Fariba) was most welcoming. The location of the hotel was just perfect. Very easily accessible from the train stations and CDG by RER, metro, bus, and within…",5
1602,"Comfortable, clean and good service. The Hotel is a little outdated and the breakfast could be more natural / healthy. It is close the Avenida da Liberdade and well communicated though not at the historic center. ",3
1603,"Clean, friendly, good location and decent internet, but it doesn't feel like 4 stars. Especially the breakfast was a bit underwhelming (e.g. no fruit salad - just around 3 different fruits; no local specialties such as Pastéis de Nata; space was always tight)",3
1604,A good reception in a beautiful and very pleasant place. We were here for business but we will come back with pleasure in holidays to visit Berlin with our children. The bedrooms are comfortable and quite. The breakfast is very good with a lot of fresh products.,4
1605,Do NOT stay here. Waiting in a line for over 3 HOURS to check in. Systems down. 3 people are checking guests there is no urgency whatsoever. Guests are lined up outside the building. We have never experienced anything like this. It is mutiny in the lobby. $600 w night suite. NOT worth it. Will never stay here again. We still do not have a room.they are turning people away and telling us to eat at the restaurants. No comps. Unbelievable.,1
1606,We really wanted to love this place. It’s a great location and we were excited to book the Heritage Suite given its ties to an UNESCO designation. The room and property were impressive. Unfortunately the AC in our room didn’t work at all during our two day stay. The staff seemed confused about how to handle the situation. They thought it was fixed shorty after our first report on the first day. Then again on day two. Unfortunately it never was fixed as we constantly had a room that was warmer than the outside temps. We maintained a near constant 27.2 (approx 81 degree F) the entire stay. Our sole consolation? A paltry offer of a 15% discount only after we asked for some type of compensation for our discomfort. This may fly for a budget friendly place but when you pay for a top…,3
1607,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for 3 nights while in Berlin. The airport shuttle picked us up from the hotel and after about 10-14 minutes we arrived just outside the door.   The first impressions were great, the reception seemed very sociable and the seating area looked like somewhere we could come and chill for a bit. Checking in was easy to, the receptionist gave us some info about the hotel and sent us up to our room. Getting into the room, everything was lovely and tidy with everything you'd expect (cleans sheets, towels in bathroom and information booklets on the desk). TV doesn't include any English channels so don't expect to watch tv if you don't speak German. The beds were comfy and the duvet perfectly fine. The heating control in the room is easy to use and can get…",4
1608,"The hotel staff in the lobby should be retrained on how to speak with customers. We were greeted with an apathetic/rude ""do you have a reservation"". The main issue was the presence of ""bouncers"" throughout the lobby during evening hours due to the ""exclusive"" night club on the 4th floor, which by the way, needed to be cleaned and renovated. The bouncers were guarding all entrances in the lobby and often rudely yelled at PAYING hotel guests. That's a hard pill to swallow after paying over $300 per night to be treated like one of the random clubbing guests off the street. I left feeling like I paid WAY too much to stay at this hotel. I would not recommend unless you plan on being in your room by 9 pm to avoid the nightclub situation. ",1
1609,"We booked a weeks holiday to Eden Mar with Thomas Cook after a lot of comparisons and research. We took our 4 year old son with us and when we arrived at 10.30am our room was not ready and would not be ready until 1pm earliest as check in is not until 2pm. We didn't know this as we booked a package we didn't even think of check in times etc. The women at tthe check out was helpful but quite brusk, she put my husband's nose out of joint by saying 'look, don't be annoyed you are getting a good room, take it up with Thomas Cook!' before he had said anything. Anyhow, whilst waiting for our room we took a walk around the grounds and the pools and gardens definately live up the pictures. In an area that is nose to nose with hotels, you really have no idea of it when you are outside at…",3

During our stay, the fire alarm gone crazy on 2 occasions - it's a non-smoking hotel! Please don't smoke here, they'll charge you 250e for that. ",4
1611,"We just arrived at the hotel. You can feel it is new but some things we already don't like: no any plates, or other kitchen ware provided although there is a proper electric oven. They said guests are expected to bring all their own, really??? Sockets location is extremely inconvenient, you can't plug Kettle where it stays. The floor is a bit dirty but after another request to clean that doesn't change much. The worst so far is neighbors behind the door connecting two rooms. I ordered VIP room and why would I have to listen them talking and maybe not sleeping all night?????? Pool is small and shallow. We will check breakfast but something tells me it won't impress us. ",2
1612,This is what you can expect to see in the in-room bathroom. Needs serious renovation. Not at the level of what one would expect from Starwood Hotels. The hotel is old and the rooms are not well mainianed. I recommend you look at your room before accepting to check in.,2
1613,We stayed at the Kim long hotel because we wanted to do the 7 hour tour to the floating markets. The location was good and the room clean but the hotel owner charged us triple the price for the tour guide and the boat driver. He should have been charged us 550000 and instead he charged us for 1500000. We had no idea about the prices because we went just for one night and we found out the next day from other travelers that they paid far less. We wouldn't mind to give this money but to the tour guide and the driver .... instead we gave it to the hotel owner who kept it as a commission! ,2
1614,"The shower is so unbelievably small....and I'm not fat!   I was there 21 hours and they charged me 2 nights!  Said I got there too early to check-in.  Checked in at 10 AM and checked out the next morning at 7 AM.   I can't help it that my 11 hour flight from the USA got me there at that time.  They charged me for 2 breakfasts (to go with the '2' nights) even though I didn't eat them.  Not sure what is up with that but that would never float in the USA where customer is King!  PS;  check-in was a long, arduous process then I got to my room and they called and needed me to come back down because they forgot to swipe my card.",2
1615,"Fantastic location close to Cathedral ,Museum island and other attractions and next to u-bahn stop. Room was small very clean and the breakfast was good.  I agree with all the other reviewers. Great value for money in Berlin.",5
1616,This is a great little hotel in a very handy location. My husband an I stayed with our 3 kids and we had very handy adjoining rooms which were spotlessly clean. The gents at reception were really helpful particularly Ben who gave us some great advice for our trip (particularly to go up the cupola at Montmatre which was fantastic) oh and he's also recommended some awesome places to eat. The hotel is very handy to the metro and their is a bus across the street which stops right outside the Louvre. All in all a great little Hotel. ,5
1617,"This is a very modern and beautiful hotel.  The pros would be:  Great views from the rooms.  Rooms are very comfortable and sound proofed.  The gym and spa are well-equipped.  Staff is very friendly and attentive.  Cons:  This is not located in what I would call the best area of town.  Unless you want cod for every meal, the restaurants are not that great.  They also do not match the quality of what  you would expect around a hotel of this type.  You may take a cab or metro to the part of the city where the sightseeing and shopping is located.  That will run you about 10 euros each way.  The restaurant in the hotel leaves a lot to be desired.  Since you are basically captive unless you want to take a cab, they make sure to take full advantage on their prices.  1 bottle of…",3
1618,Good location. Not far away from the train station and other methods of transportation. The hotel was very clean and the beds very comfortable. The staff were nice and tried very hard to have us checked in earlier since we had a meeting at 2pm.,4

The staff at this place go through the motions and are not engaged!  Noisey corridors, poor lighting, small rooms, unpleasant staff, no chairs on balconies, poor ventilation, no clothes airer, very little hanging space and storage.  This place doesn't represent good value for money considering location.",2
1622,This place is nothing short of horrific.  I would classify as a dump.  If I could get a refund I'd run straight to a holiday inn as I'm sure it would be an upgrade.  Filthy bathrooms. Filthy rugs. Decaying walls and rooms overall.  Literally a 1 star hostel level place.  It's a shame as the staff are all pleasant and helpful but the rooms are disgusting.  My kids who normally don't notice anything are asking to leave.   DO NOT RISK THIS PLACE. IT'S DIRTY AND DETERIORATED.,1
1623,"Rooms are incredibly tiny at this property.  I would estimate the room size (including the bathroom) at under 150 square feet.  The rooms are so small that there is not a real closet - more like a small hole in the wall.  The desk - 12 inches deep - is located directly under the tv.  As a result, if you could sit at the desk, your face would be 2 inches from the tv.  You cannot sit at the desk because it is not possible to fit the desk chair between the bed and the desk.  I don't mean that if you did so that you could not walk through, you literally cannot fit the desk chair in front of the desk.  The bathroom is equally small.  No fridge, no minibar, no closet, no space.  It is a good location, but it is false advertising for websites (ahem, Priceline) to show this as a 4 star…",1
1624,Visited with friends and stayed in a dorm. The staff are friendly the bar is well stocked and they have a reasonable food menu. The accommodation was below average if you plan on staying don't count on a lot of sleep! We stayed over a weekend and there was a DJ in the bar playing exceptionallly loud music until 3am which not only could be heard through the ear plugs provided but could also be felt.  The shower in the en-suite was very poor. The aircon was so loud that we had to ask for it to be turned off by the staff. Fortunately it wasn't very hot or it would have been another noise to contend with.  Overall I could not recommended Durty Nelly's for their accommodation. On a week day it might be different and another room might have a better shower. However I have to base my…,3
1625,I was really impressed with my stay here. The hotel was better than I anticipated from the pictures and the artwork really makes it one of a kind. Our room is small but I knew it would be...it's Paris!  It had quirky decor and a cute little Juliet balcony plus a comfy bed and one duvet (as opposed to 2 on a double bed - is it German style?!). I also liked the location and it was easy to get around to other parts of Paris with a short walk to the Metro. I will recommend!,5

We then went into our room and was pleasantly surprised there was a table with about four stools so it was perfect for pre drinks! We stayed in 6 bed dorm so it consisted of 3 bunk beds, I found the beds to be extremely comfortable think they used memory foam mattresses! However, you did have to put your own bedding on, which wasn't much of a problem. The toilet facilities were good, there was always enough hot water to go around, and also towels were free at reception! We also were on the first floor so we still got decent WiFi connection…",5
1628,Booked transfers to/from airport as holiday site we booked with said it was 45 min transfer. Wrong !! 5 mins. And as other people have said this puts you right in the flight path with planes every 20 mins literally right over your head !!   The websites also say each room has a balcony....when we arrived we were told we had to pay extra €70 if we wanted a balcony. Which we did. However reception did not tell us the lift was broken and it was on the 3rd floor. We were told the lift would be fixed next day. It was fixed 5 days later.   The view from our room was a derelict empty old house in front of the hotel overgrown with weeds.   I'm glad we moved up to higher floors as guests on floors 1 & 2 had ants in their rooms.

The bad: The paint is peeling or scratched in many places-our room (209) and spa (by the pool) . The shower is not well designed-the water drips on the wall and mould is visible by the door. There was missing grout around the bathroom sink as well. There is not enough light in the bathroom by the mirror. The air con humming from outside (room 209 for sure) is bearable but not good for light sleepers like me (and I asked for back facing room based on the other reviews noting bin trucks on the front of the hotel in the early hours).

It's easy to grab a taxi to the ones that are a bit further. Taxi's are quite cheap in Lissabon and most trips we did were between €7 (Castle on the hill) and €10 (Belem and Oceanaria).   The hotel room was comfortable albeit a bit noisy - we stayed on the 4th floor. We put the air condition unit on at night to balance out any street noise. The beds are firm and comfortable.

When we arrived around 1200 we were told that no rooms were ready and reminded that check in was actually 1600 and no rooms were available before then. We were advised that we could store our luggage. We were taken to another building alongside the hotel (beside a car park) and advised that was where the luggage would be held.

The staff were brilliant - incredibly flexible and offered us some great advice on places to go and visit.

They have frozen pizzas and sandwiches, but it would be so amazing, to have an awesome menu after a long trip. - Thin walls.",4
1642,"This is a relatively new hotel.  It's in a very central location with easy access to public transportation and the main Berlin train station.  It's also near museums and some other tourist attractions.  There are certainly hipper, cooler, and more interesting neighborhoods in which to stay when visiting Berlin.  But depending on the reason for your visit, this hotel could be right for you.  If you stay here, it's important to understand that this is a conference hotel.  As a result, it is often quite full.  The elevators are in frequent demand.  The breakfast facility is large and visited by a large number of people.  That said, they manage to make it work well, although it seemed clear to me that the staff was relatively young and could sometimes give the impression that they…",4
1643,"Good hotel, clearly for a short trip or business trip. The toilet is very spacious and clean. The bed is quite small compared to other hotels I have stayed at. Keeps you close to your husband which works in your favour too ! TV doesn't have anything in English other than CNN or BBC. Would like more options. The breakfast buffet is horrible. Only bread butter jam and plain croissants. No eggs available nor any fruits. The least you could offer is salad or some chocolate croissant or Churros. Overall, good stay with average location, but plan your breakfast outside. ",4
1644,My wife and I were desperate to escape from Disneyland Paris and experience something real! So a last minute email to the Recamier found us on the Left Bank - thanks to the helpful advice of Cecilia. Could not have been more different from the NewPort Bay Hotel at Disney. Rooms were fantastically tasteful. Brilliant location - excellent for the Louvre - about a 12 minute walk away. V near St Sulpice. Small details like afternoon tea a real delight. We were even able to scoot up the Eiffel Tower without booking. So all in all a really wonderful 24 hours en Paris!,5
1645,"Stayed at this hotel for 7 days in May 2007,for the price we paid it was first rate value,staff are very hepful and friendly the place is well located and is  extremely clean.Ask for a room at the rear overlooking the pool its a lot quieter than the front where a main road runs.Air con is great the only drawback at the moment and it is a real downer is that there is a massive building development next door with constant noise from 8am to 8pm every day exept Sunday.We only managed one day around the pool and that was on Sunday.There ar about 4 massive cranes constantly swihging over the pool area and concrete is delivered by the ton every day.This is not the hotels fault of course but it is very annoying,work is due to be completed in spring 2008 and after that i would think…",3
1646,"-Location: the hotel is a little bit beyond the real tourist area even though it is on Santa Catarina St. At night the area may be a little bit dodgy and the staff advised me to stay on travelled streets. If you are a good walker and can handle slopes it is still well located with most of the major tourist sites within 30 minutes walk. We found that we could probably walk somewhere faster than a cab during peak traffic hours. -Parking is at a nearby parking lot and easily accessible. -Check in: quick, easy, very friendly and helpful desk staff. -Accommodation: the rooms are small by US standards but very reasonable for Europe. There is no drawer space and very limited hanging space but there is room to lay out your suitcases and leave them open out of the way. There is no room…",3
1647,"Very small room, the door hit the desk on entry/exit and you risked knocking over the tv when walking around the bed. Air Con vent was noisy and would vibrate the floor whether you were using the Air Con or not. You are paying for location only.",1
1648,The appearance of the Hotel and the room are really beautiful.  As a black female I experienced some racism upon checking-in as a elite member.  The room service (food) was pretty bad.  The hotel is away from everything and the cost to everything is somewhat expensive.  If I go again I will want to leave in the downtown area where the shops etc are walking distance.,2
1649,My husband and I had a great stay in the Axel. The staff at the reception was super-friendly and helpful. Rooms were nice (we had a suite) and clean. Surprisingly if you think how much glass there is that the housekeeper was able to keep it that clean. We will be back next summer!,5
1650,"This hotel is perfect location for travelling and located right off the champs elysees - the rooms were clean and we were offered an upgrade on arrival which was great! The staff were friendly and security is good as you have to buzz to get in (but your buzzed straight in, no waiting around!)  Only problem was we could hear our next door neighbors quite clearly (which tended to keep us awake sometimes) but this may be because they kept slamming the door and talking loudly more than a problem with the room itself. The room was ready early when we arrived at 10.30am which gave us chance to have a quick freshen up before exploring having been up since 3am.  Definitely recommend this hotel for people wishing to see the best that Paris has to offer and not have to walk too far to see…",5
1651,"The Hotel location is good, decoration is more or less ok, i could give it 3-4 stars but for sure not 5.  I stayed here because i got no choise, all hotels was overbooked. So  dry conclusion : “5 stars” is not really 5, I could not sleep at all cause of incoming loud  windy noise  over the window, breakfast not included (hotel rate was 1k USD for night), Buffet menu for breakfust  40 USD / you serv the table yourself but when you sign for the bill no one forget to ask for tips - really , tips for doing nothing. Overall experience - This is my worst ever stay in my life, i could not sleep 3 nights.",1
1652,"We stayed here for two days. Reached super early in the morning (7 am), obviously the room wasn’t ready, and we weren’t expecting it to be, although I had emailed them earlier about the timings. When we reached the hotel, we were received by two females at the reception. One of them was friendly and understanding, and very helpful in the end. The other (the younger one) was so arrogant. We told her in a friendly manner that usually 3 pm is a little late for check in, to which she very curtly replied that you should check out earlier if you want an earlier check in. I was left flabbergasted by the tone in which she spoke. It seemed like she didn’t want us there, despite us taking deluxe rooms. In fact I didn’t dare to go to the reception till the time she was around.   Other than…",4
1653,"the rooms are OK in this hotel, but the service attitude of the entire hotel staff is substandard. the worst service performance was delivered in the lobby bar. there are better hotels with much better service performance available in Shanghai.                ",2
1654,"I’ll give the pro first:  The location is good.  You are two doors down from The Fontainebleau and right on the ocean in Miami.  And that the end of the pro list.  On the con side: I was on the 11th floor which is the penthouse floor (PH in the elevator).  Well the penthouse floor smells.  Also the carpet was extremely dirty.  The hotel is very dated, including the room decor.  Hotel staff not helpful.  I tried breaking a $20 in the gift shop so I could tip the valet, that employee sent me to the front desk.  Gal at the front desk sent me to (you guessed it) the gift shop.  I would have tried the bar but it was closed.",1
1655,"Hotel is a short walk from Alexanderplatz station with a good selection of bars, restaurants/coffee shops and high street shops close by. Underground station right at the end of the block so really easy to get round the city from close by. Staff were really helpful when I needed some documents printed, scanned and emailed swiftly. Done straight away with a smile. Thankfully the front desk team also speak very good English as my German is woeful. The room price was reasonable and I liked their room service policy - they don't disturb you and only service your room if you hang the tag on the door before midday. Great when you need a lie in.  The only minor thing to watch for is the honesty bar. Great idea, but someone did put our room number on their form by mistake (or maybe…",5
1656,We were in Amsterdam for a couple of days and we were looking for a cheap night before getting our train to Paris. My girlfriend and I slept in a 8 bed dorm for the first time (I think it's a bit uncomfortable for a couple to stay in a mixed dorm room) but given the price (in the West) it was okay. Not really much you can say more about accommodation like this... ,3
1657,"The hotel is located nicely within 3 to 4 minutes walking distance to the nearest metro station. The rooms are modern, quiet, big enough and beautifully furnished. The rain shower was also a big plus and the bed was very big and comfortable! WIFI was available throughout the hotel and worked great. The personnel at the reception was very friendly and helpful and they spoke really good English (which is a big plus for me since I don't speak any French). The spa was also great, they even opened it up again especially for us.  Overall a great expierience and I'd book again in a second.",5
1658,It's an airport hotel. Everyone staying here is either just landed or going on somewhere else. The airport starts operating at 4am. Doesn't matter. You cannot check in til 2pm no matter what. There were dozens of tired people and hundreds of suitcases in reception lobby (very hot and no drinks available) and three receptionists standing there to refuse any one to check in until 2pm.  In an airport hotel this is unforgivable. We vacated our room at 4am to get our next flight but nobody will have been allowed to occupy it again til the next afternoon. They need to organise this much better.  The hotel is a short walk from terminal one so you dont need to queue for a taxi. However be aware if your outbound flight is from terminal TWO (its a departures only terminal) you WILL need a…,3
1659,"So my partner and I stayed here he was there for work and I joined him for the weekend, the apartment was great , great location, well equipped, my only issue was the mezzanine bed it was not very clean in the furthest corners, I slightly lifted the mattress up and we saw lots and lots of long black hair, we did not want too ruin the weekend so I cleaned it up as best as I could ! it was pretty gross though.   We enjoyed the upstairs bar bit with balconies and glass atrium we were their during very sunny hot weather so all in all it was okay; if management read this they need too make sure they clean under the mattresses in the furthest hardest places too reach it being a mezzanine.",3
1660,"My boyfriend and I stayed in this hotel this past weekend and it was one of the worst places I have ever stayed. The room and hallways are very uninviting and the carpeting is very old. The curtains on the windows as well as the shower curtain is disgusting and old, need to be replaced. For some reason we had no hot water, we let the water run for a while but it still did not exceed lukewarm temps, made showering miserable. The door to our room didn't close unless you pulled/pushed it very hard. Right before we checked out my boyfriend used the bathroom for the last time and the handle fell off of the faucet in the bathroom sink. Only positive review I have is the sheets were clean and the bed was pretty comfortable.",1
1661,"It was quite a nice weather when I went to the roofbar. The view was breathtaking as always, we could see the skyscrapers clearly. The price was a little bit too pricey, but it's fine since it's a five star hotel. The drink itself just so-so, I would recommend you to go to another bar in Shanghai where you can have a better cocktail with a cheaper price. The staff can't speak proper English, it was so hard communicating with them when I asked for suggestions. I saw the manager always plays with the phone and did nothing, just joking around with the bartender. The table was also not clean when I came. Definitely a poor service, won't be coming back because there are a lot of rooftop bars with similar view.",2
1662,"The location is quite far away from the central station. I booked a 4 people guest room, but the room is relatively small. Also, the breakfast there is quite expensive, while the choice to eat is little.",3

1664,Everything a typical city slicker is looking for you will find in Berlin. To start with a tip where to stay when in Berlin I highly recommend Rent24 Coliving apartments. Don't let the outside of the building fool you because once you arrive at the reception on the 4th floor you feel a funky energy floating around. The staff is very helpful and polite and the walk to your room is a discovery on its own. The colorful paintings from different Berlin street artist are a joy to watch. The 40m2 apartment was above expectations and the beds comfortable. The city center is stretched but if you don't like to walk to much public transport is the easiest way to move around. It's cheap and punctual. Transit from the airport to the city center was only 3.40 euro's. For food lovers you can…,5
1665,"I LOVED this hotel. It was modern, and beautifully decorated, but also felt comfortable and cosy. The interior design of this hotel is just fabulous. The staff were so warm and helpful. The breakfast was the best I've found in Paris, a hot buffet with delicious scrambled eggs, and fresh avocado :) Only 2 issues I found with the place (and this is at a stretch) was that the coffee was pretty awful and undrinkable, and the fitness centre left a lot to be desired, but literally everything else was wonderful and I would definitely stay here again whether on business or a weekend away",5
1666,"The apartment was absolutely lovely. It was small, but perfect for my husband and I and our toddler for the weekend. it was generally well equipped and Dailyflats provided a cot and high chair. The air con unit was very welcome and we absolutely adored the two terraces where we had most of our meals. The only minus points were that the terraces have divisions that block off the satellites equipment on the roof. Unfortunately, the gap on the bottom is quite large - my toddler was able to wriggle under the gap and it was through sheer luck that we managed to grab her quick enough before we lost her... It might be worth making the gap smaller so children cannot wriggle under. We would return.",4

So I call the hotel early to let them know, I'm on my way and the person I spoke with told me they do not allow early checks in and all the rooms are sold out.

1668,"Problem #1: The elevator was broken for 75% of our stay. Three small girls had to lug suitcases up 5 flights of stairs with zero help from the two men half asleep at the front desk. I understand that these things happen, but the staff did not have to be rude about it. I also witnessed the man working the front desk (at night on May 18) raise his voice at 3 other travelers when they complained about having to carry their suitcases up the small staircase to the top floor. Problem #2: The man checking us in (around 11pm on May 18) claimed that we had only booked for 3 nights. He proceeded to argue with us for about 5 minutes over the issue, despite the fact that we showed him the confirmation on our email AND the fact that the page that HE HAD PRINTED OUT said that we booked for 4…",1

1670,"We stayed for a week.  The room was large and well appointed, and perfectly cleaned and serviced.; breakfasts are excellent.  Two caveats:   1.  Our room overlooked Auguststrasse, and it was noisy at times, so we had a conflict between keeping the window open for temperature control, and being wakened by people late at night and wagons in the morning. Like, as I understand it, most Berlin hotels, there isn't air conditioning.  Other rooms overlooked the internal couryard, and are probably much quieter.  You should ask! 2. There is no public area / bar, so nowhere for evening relaxation.  The area has lots of cafes and bars within a very short walk, but this might be a limitation, depending on your circumstances.",4
1671,"This sprawling 1980s complex, comprising three connected hotels, still looks good but has perhaps been a victim of its own success in many ways. They evidently took more bookings than they could sensibly manage when we visited, thus the need to open up the emergency 'room of doom' with its scenic view of the car park, malfunctioning bathroom, poorly maintained kitchenette and unsecured security windows. However, to be fair the staff were very charming and did attempt to resolve these issues one by one; they couldn't actually move us to another room as those available only had a bath and no shower (which is no use when you get back from hiking around the island), but most of the other technical glitches were eventually fixed. One of the potential attractions of this hotel is that…",3
1672,"We stayed for three nights in a double room on the ground floor. The room was very small with the bed pushed up against a wall with no bedside tables. We did however expect this due to the type of building, area of town and price. It was quite difficult to have water on hand through the night and do without nearby charging points. The lighting switches were also at various points around the room which made it frustrating to turn lights on and off. The decor was pleasant and interesting with the rustic/urban theme continuing through the hotel. Breakfast was pretty basic with only one hot item but overall sufficient enough.   The hotel is located near several major museums, luxury/high end retail stores and a choice of restaurants. We walked everywhere we needed to, though a…",3

No included brunch like every other Hilton product we have stayed at.,1

Mould..lots of it, on the shower curtain. 4. Flying ant nest in light above bed, was made to feel like we were asking too much for the manager (ignacio) to remove them. 5.

For example, after arriving pretty late in the night I went down to breakfast and asked for a black tea - this arrived cold, not lukewarm, but stone cold. I was not impressed! So for the next two days I ordered breakfast via the overnight menu on the door. Second day was OK but the third day my ""sunny side up"" eggs arrived half raw!. The lifts were old and as I was staying on the 14th floor I discovered that some 14th floor buttons did not work (depending upon which one of the 6 lifts you got into) - that was somewhat annoying.

1702,"We stay in Room 82 for 6 nights.  Room is big & clean.  The only drawback is no kettle was provided.  The location is perfect to us.  It located nearby train station ""Sants"".    I can easily arrived by train from airport and have a day trip to Figueres.",4
1703,"this hotel has no AC or safe available in room. No parking, just valet service from public structure next block. Rooms are small and old.  Staff was very rude and uncooperative  when we complained. No manager on site and did not make herself available at time of complaint.  We decided not to stay because it didn't provide what we were looking for. Not to mention Booking.com does not alert customers of no AC or no safe in the room, and they won't be held accountable.",1
1704,"Close to Postdamer Platz, the hotel is well located near the main city landmarks.  The staff was very energetic and prompt to answer all questions  The Room was very bright and helped making it look more spacious, the was not AC but you could open the windows. The room feel was contemporary and clean. Remember to lock your door when you leave!  There's fruit and infused water at the front desk and I never got my welcome drink, but overall the place was really good to explore the city and the have a good rest!",4
1705,"We stayed there on a recommendation. The location was great. We were a short walk to the Port Cellars and right around the corner from the waterfront cafés, restaurant shops and boat launches. For a 4 star hotel who advertised WiFi we did not have it in our room. We stayed in room 315 for 2 nights After check in we complained to the front desk about not being able to get wifi. The front desk said some rooms were better than others and shrugged their shoulders. They also pointed out that our view of the river should compensate for any lack of wifi. They suggested we use wifi in the lobby. When we commented again upon check out about the wifi they said we should have complained before. We told them we did. The clerk also admitted that they knew there was problems in some rooms. So…",3
1706,"When we arrived we were pleasantly surprised, lovely staircase and hallway into reception. Check in was very fast and easy.  Rooms were adequate and clean, free water and beer in the mini bar which is a bonus, lovely view of the river spree.  Hotel is walking distance to alexanderplatz or ubahn is next to the hotel. Negs: wifi is terrible, connection is poor. Rooms arent soundproof we could hear EVERYTHING from next door which was a bit uncomfortable. Other than that the hotel is lovely! ",4
1707,"From the moment we arrived, the staff were so lovely and helpful. We travelled with our toddler and arrived at around 9pm - the receptionist greeted us (by name) on arrival and advised that they had kept the restaurant open for us as they knew we were arriving late and would be travelling with a child. We were so impressed by this. More than once in our first few days, staff asked if there was anything more they could do for us or our child (21 months). The hotel was also impeccably clean, always people around cleaning and the maid service was great every day. The restaurant staff were friendly and helpful and food was replenished quickly. My little boy was in his element getting doted on by everyone! Rooms: rooms are dated. Being totally honest, they need to get rid of the…",3
1708,I booked a room at this location waiting for my apartment to be ready for move in. I am a regular Marriott guest and former employee so I know the ins and outs of Marriott hospitality. That being said the property is lovely the staff is horrible. No one in the hotel is very helpful and they are all extremely rude and standoffish. The front desk staff botched my reservation several times and kicked my family out because of a mistake they made and didn't even apologize for the inconvenience. It was a very poor choice in staff even the management is rude and unhelpful. If you care going for location and not for experience then this is the place to be but if you are going for a Marriott experience you will not find it at this hotel,1
1709,"After spending 2 nights here,I am not sure if my experience is what I was expecting from a 5*hotel. The hotel is in a very good location about 30 min walk from the center of Firta..There is a shuttle bus from hotel to town every 4 hours. The view from this hotel is something that we could never imagine.But our room was a bit disappointing. There was no coffee machine or a kettle in the room.Every afternoon we had to order hot water for tea from the restaurant and then wait for the waiter to come.  Furnishing was not for a 5*hotel maybe 3*or less.  Wifi was horrible.We could not connect at all and nobody tried to fix our connection in the room. For all these issues I would not return in this hotel. I am sure there are better options in the same price range.",3

Very foggy coudnt see the ocean also the view was cement and a dumping ground.I needed help with the wifi. No one in reception,called out a few times and walked around reception area,heard voices and the owner came out and helped,lovely lady. second time I needed assistance again no-one around,waited around and called out a few times ,then left as no assistance available.good position,bus stop outside door ,Around 15 min walk to Fira town,near restraunts,bakerys,supermarket.

We booked a junior suite many months before our trip and being a HHonors Diamond member, one is normally entitled to an upgrade or at least the best room amongst the category booked. Our suite had no view at all. There was an office building literally 10 meters away so we had to keep the curtains closed not to be bothered by complete strangers. There was no view, none. My kind question about the why was not taken too seriously so we ended up with a feeling of disappointment. No doubt it is a beautiful place but I have experienced better service from some of the members of staff. Just some friendly words…",4

We visited Spain, Italy, and France. When we got to Le Robinet, it was like coming home. By the time we made it to France, I was sick (i.e., horrible cough and looked like the walking dead. LOL). It was nice to have the large Executive Suite to relax and try to get better, before the long flight back home. The staff here is wonderful, the bakery down the street has the BEST baguettes, and the location is close to Chateau Landon (train station). The hotel restaurant is wonderful! The food is very well made. Terrance (at the restaurant) is so kind, attentive, and it…",5

If opportunistic weekend event pricing, a dingy environment, advertised amenities and features which were not available , and pounding music from a ""private party"" that rattled the windows all the way up to the seventh floor until 2 AM in the morning is your thing, then this might be just the place for you. Toss in a front desk staff that doesn't answer the phone, management which is nowhere to be found, thin pathetic mattresses, slow elevators, a ""fitness center"" that is little more than a glorified closet with a couple pieces of equipment, tacky hostel wannabe decor, and a cafe that can't make a cup of coffee in less than 15 minutes...you get the picture.

1718,Mixed feelings about this Hotel.We stayed here once before and it was great . They took great care of us . This time not so much. We came down so we would be close to airport and little Italy/San Diego Bay Front on are last night in California. The hotel let us check in supper early which was great. Unfortunately that meant we got an adjoining room and the walls /door you here everything and the person left tv on when they left. When they got back at 1:30 am I had to call front desk. They came right up and quit them down but you could still hear them. On top of that the A/C kept turning back to old setting making it very hot. Terrible night sleep . Expected better for 200 plus a night. Its to bad this is a lovely hotel. The hotel didn't seem to care if we had a poor experience.…,2
1719,Dated hotel with mediocre staff that’s just not up to today’s standards. I booked a suite and it did not even come with a free bottle of water. They charged me $8 for it. And at checkout they misplaced my bill. Just not up to scratch.,1
1720,"We spent two uncomfortable nights here. When we arrived about 4 p.m. the room the clerk gave us keys to wasn't ready. The room is very tiny, had a strange slope to the floor and there wasn't even a chair let alone table. The tiny area where there is a fridge (the smallest I have ever seen, very shallow, and it wanted to tip over when I opened it) and a coffee maker (only decaf pods supplied which was odd) had no light overhead. The walls are paper thin and we heard every thing from the next room including whole conversations and someone blow drying their hair at midnight. I have never been in such a noisy hotel before.You expect to hear sounds from other rooms from time to time but not to feel like you are actually in the other room! But the worst problem, however, was that the room was very hot on a cold winter's day. We slept very badly. The air conditioner is very loud but you shouldn't have to use it in the middle of winter. There are two windows but they open onto a tiny enclosed space with windows of other rooms very close by. The bathroom fan didn't work. The sheets had some stains in one place that looked like mold that didn't wash out. Not sure why bleach wouldn't have gotten rid of that. The only plus is that it's a good location and there is parking on site. The bathroom lighting was good but there was no shelf to put items on. The hotel is expensive as is much of San Francisco. A much better option would be an airbnb where the owner cares about offering good service.…",1
1721,"The location’s perfect, literally 20 secs to the beach. The food in Poseidon taverna is excellent, too!  However, our experience was not good. My family and I usually go to huge resorts with all inclusive and big pools. Poseidon beach was at the same prize level as a resort that we usually stay in. When we got the rooms (we had booked two rooms with king size beds, and asked for one extra bed to be placed in one of the rooms). First of all, the standard is not better than OK. Small rooms, but clean and neat. Most of the rooms come with a balcony that is hard to open. However, the extra bed was not placed in neither of the rooms, so we had to change because the room we got was WAY too small to put an extra bed there. After that, they gave us a room that looked like many of the…",3

We booked this hotel on Hotwire and ended up paying about 80USD for the night. The ride from TXL to the hotel was about 20 Euro each way, and took about 20 minutes without traffic. There are a ton of restaurants nearby.  Front desk staff was very courteous and made an effort to help out. Our luggage was stranded and we got an extra bathrobe in the room to use as a pajamas, and some additional toiletry stuff to help us out overnight.    The rooms are prettily decorated, and there was enough space for all three of us. The beds and the bed-sheets were comfortable. Bathroom had everything we needed. The one thing I did not like about the bathroom,…",4

Their breakfasts are ample and after a day of touring their elevator is a godsend.

1724,Hotel was well priced for a two star hotel but lacked room facilities particularly a kettle.  Staff were very friendly and helpful and the rooms were clean. Minimal food availability was unsatisfactory but  there were good variety of restaurants within 20 mins walk of hotel. Location was quite a bit from centre of town although subway was close.,4
1725,"Went to Berlin with two friends, totally unprepared. Our first night we went for cheap at this hostel. We didn’t want to go totally cheap on a dorm so took a whole room for ourselves, which with towels etc. Included was still cheaper than a hotel. Room was clean, shared toilets and showers down the hall were quite clean as well, every time I went there day and night. Helpful friendly staff.  I’m more a hotel person myself, I like to have my own bathroom and a bit more luxury, but if you like to spend your money in the city instead of in your room, and don’t mind making your own bed with the stuff you collect downstairs, than this is a nice place.",4

Two bellman were standing next to me, i had a large luggage, none offered help, none even noticed someone was actually checking in:-) had a business meeting at 9am, asked for 8am wake up call, phone rang at 7am....thanks for making my sleep one hour shorter than it already was! Asked to call back at the correct-8am-time, phone rang at 8.30 this time! Anyway, the whole stay was just not pleasant! The area- the whole city actually id so dirty, full of homeless people and graffiti. Will not come back if i dont have to!  ",2

We had a door to the balcony which we thought would be nice in the evening to sit and enjoy the view. This was not the case, on opening the door on the first night there was a very loud generator noise from the Hotel next door. We never got to use the balcony which was very disappointing. The pool area was very clean and the drinks brought round by the waiter was very welcoming. The area around the pool is very slippy and I witness 2 ladies fall.The food was plentiful and good, we never used the other restaurants.

(We had to sit with the window open for an entire day and a huge fan in the middle of the room as they refused to change it.)  However it is not the smallest of the ones they offer surprisingly. What gives this place a 1 star is the manager David, his lack of any problem solving skills, lack of hospitality, his tactless language towards guests, and the fact that he lied multiple times to the IHG customer service number when they were trying to rectify our issues.   I would like to add we are Spire members and were ambassadors though we cancelled it prior to this stay because of lack of any…",1

The staff were super friendly and very helpful throughout the time we spent there.  The room was very, very small but cute and just enough space for the two of us. We knew we weren't spending much time in the room so it didn;t really matter.  The beds were comfortable very clean and the window opened up onto a quiet back area of the neighborhood.

I asked if we could change rooms and they said they were fully committed for the duration of our stay, even though I checked online and they were still selling suites.

We asked four times for the AC to be lowered and the staff said they'd do something, to which they never did. Really ruined my stay as I struggled to sleep so badly. Tip: don't drink on the terrace.

We ate at Shikoku, the sushi restaurant across the street, twice, and it was one of the cheapest meals we had, which included a half bottle of wine. We found a little grocery a couple of blocks down where we were able to buy bottles of wine and snacks. The hotel is super clean and new.",5

Staff were mostly friendly and helpful, a light bulb that wasn’t working in our room was replaced quickly. On two occasions during our four night stay, both of our key cards stopped working despite being kept separately from other magnetized cards and cell phones.

Additionally after a long day traveling, presenting at the conference and having a late celebratory dinner I come back to the Hotel and realize that I remember the room number but not the floor so instead of walking around the hotel potentially waking other guests i ask at the reception. Hovever, the one…",1
1760,"Excellent hotel, great service, outstanding breakfast, clean and comfortable rooms. Bonus, just minutes from a small grocery story and pharmacy. We stayed in the hotel for the German championship in swimming and it could not have been a better place. 5 min from the venue. 2 min from the light rail to go downtown. Beds were very comfortable.",5
1761,"I was very disappointed in my stay at this hotel. The building is so old and not well kept. It's currently under construction and can hardly operate during this time. The $52.00 valet service is a joke. Took almost 45 minutes to get my car in the am, while no one else was waiting. The elevators are scary. I would never go back to this hotel. Waste of money. ",1
1762,"We have been there for 7 nights, the hotel is located in the center of berlin, and it has a u-ban station next to it's door, directly to Alexanderplatz (1 stop). The hotel has a high standard of cleaning. The room is modern designed and the bed was comfortable. Breakfast is also included and its a great one! Highly recommended.",5
1763,"This hotel is not worth the price.  The musty stench from corridor hits you the minute the lift doors open.  Rooms are dark, gloomy and dingy.  Toilet walls and bath tubs feels slimy. All-in, an awful experience. Only pro is that it is centrally located, with bus stop on its doorsteps.  It also means traffic noise throughout the night.",2

No Wi-Fi in the guest rooms; only a short LAN line, forcing you to stay at desk all the time. Forget using iPad. They lend Wi-Fi routers, but they don't work. Checked out after 1 night; went to Intercontinental.",2

Housekeeping is a little sloppy, my trash can was on the table, and a few other things I can't remember. Only that there were minor housekeeping issues. The reception staff is very helpful as well as friendly. ",4
1769,"This hotel was a really great find. The rooms are large and new-looking. Hotel is a short walk away from nice cafes/restaurants/supermarkets, and bus stops (also directly to the airport). Amenities are sparse, but you can call the front desk to request additional things like bedroom slippers.",5
1770,Do not stay here.  There are plenty of hotels you can stay at that are better than this.  I am currently staying here but will be checking out tomorrow in the AM as soon as I can.  I am the 2nd room they gave me as the first was disgusting.  It smelled and just felt dingy and gross.  Second room is not much better and I am almost scared to lay in the bed as it appears small and dirty.  The lobby has seen better days and the rooms are just gross with a funky smell.  I will be checking out as soon as I can and heading to another hotel.  Front Desk staff was rude upon check in and they gave me two double beds when I specifically reserved and paid for a king.    STAY HERE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  CHOOSE ANOTHER HOTEL THIS PLACE IS A DUMP!!!,1

Bedroom has a coffee machine, use both pods and bottle of water on first morning and they were not replaced and on calling reception told that first day was comp and if I wanted them replaced I had to pay!  Hotel advertises Tea and Coffee making facilities but you have to pay if you stay for more that 1 day.......  As per other reviews, sound proofing internally and externally is poor and not to IHG standards and some rooms even offer ear plugs!!!!!!

1772,We were at Marina club several days in July. The pool area is never cleaned from what we saw. Sun beds are dirty. The staff who work in the bar are great - George and Anna in particular but very overworked with little time to see to the detail of tables/umbrellas/cleaning - although not their fault! We ordered lunch but after chasing several times for sandwiches waited one and a half hours! We didn't order again and went elsewhere! The place is looking tired and needs keeping up to but little chance with so few staff! Been here 3 years running - this will be our last!,3
1773,"I generally write reviews when there is something I would want to know as a traveler making decisions.  This weekend we stayed at the W Chicago at Navy Pier and were disappointed.  Customer service was below my expectations, particularly for this type of hotel.  This was not enough to write a negative review until experiencing effects of a banquet directly above our heads on Saturday night with music decibels loud enough to hear every word and cause vibrations in the ceiling.  I called down to the desk as the noise was well beyond excessive especially during late hours and was told the following: yes, there is a banquet on the 32cd floor and it will continue until midnight.  This is a very important banquet and no requests will be made to reduce the noise.    We have children…",1
1774,"Judged on US Hiltons this is about average,  run of the mill.   But judged on its own claims as a luxury property, it fails.   The rooms,  even the executive ones are dull,  tired and worn.  Stained carpet and grubby-looking furniture in ours.   Perhaps we were unlucky.     But equipping executive rooms with take-away cardboard cups is just another example of this hotel's version of ""luxury"" - and appears to be hotel policy.   Looking through reviews i see the hotel thanks critics for their reviews,  and pledges to improve.   That looks like an empty promise.",2
1775,"Stayed for 3 nights with partner.  Lovely modern hotel with access to spa. Central and easy to navigate around the city with a train station 3 mins walk away and 5mins to the nearest tram.   We loved our room and as a couple away, we loved the glass wall that separates the bedroom and bathroom, although can understand why this wouldn't be suited to everyones needs.  Had breakfast at the hotel one morning, there was alot to choose from but would say that it is quite pricey. You can find cheaper and nicer breakfast options at nearby cafes if you take a walk and explore.   Spa and gym on the small side with only 4 loungers, but these were usually occupied by the couple that run the spa, their kids or their visiting friends. This was the only downfall we can fault the hotel for. …",4

Upon registering for $400 a night I was reminded at the front desk that they would charge me for  a second pod of coffee at the coffee machine in my room.  The room was cold and impersonal-- a far cry from the gracious original Campton Place before it became the property of the Taj chain.   The luxuries expected were not available in the room. Over all, I felt nickled and dimed and overcharged for what I got.",1

I spoke to the owner about the problem and he never even considered that perhaps one of his staff could have made a mistake he just said, "" I think you are are lying"". And I was paying $1200 to stay there! I'll never stay there again.   My recommendation, San Francisco has a lot of great places to stay, keep looking.",1
1778,"We stayed here for 4 nights over new year and mainly agree with the other reviews. The location is fantastic with great views. Very central for the Metro etc. There were places to eat but they were limited unless you went further afield and sometimes hard to find. We arrived and were greeted and shown the apartment. We were then invited to take a seat at the table and essentially given the lots and lots and lots and lots of information. It was all a little bit too much to take in. None of us could remember half of what was said and actually got a bit of a muddle with which bus to take, which Metro to take where and which restaurant was best recommended. I now understand why we where given the information all in one go! We arrived on 30 December And apart from seeing someone…",4

Just  minutes from the beach and the route for the tourist bus.  The staff behind the desks were smiley and friendly especially Mark who was very helpful.  One person was not at all helpful behind the desk.  He had no name tag so I presume he was the GM.  When asked about printing our boarding passes he just barked over there, you do it yourself and pointed to computer desk.   If you are dealing with tourists (especially 2 well travelled OAP's)  I would expect you be extra helpful, explicit and kind.  This man's attitude  was totally unacceptable.",4
1781,"The rooms were not clean,  this hotel is not a four star hotel and please don't expect too much from them. However I enjoyed their food and the people at the front desk were helpful. Surely I will not stay in this hotel again.",2
1782,"Expensive, in my opinion (normal price €99 but I paid €75, which is plenty enough for just a night in a hotel for one person!), but it's Amsterdam in summer so not really surprising... I booked for a single room but got a double bedroom (they are at the same price anyway), which was nice. Quite large bathroom with good pressure in the shower, but be careful with kids, the water can get way too hot! Little storage, you wouldn't want to stay for a week. No tea or coffee or water for when you arrive, which I find a bit shocking for the price. Safe and desk in the room. Bus to the city close by (takes about 10min once you're in the bus to get dropped at the central station) and free parking in the hotel building, so that's a plus. Breakfast €11 online or €16 if bought directly at…",3

As I landed late I arrived in hotel after midnight. Checked in and was placed in dark, smelly smoking room even-though my reservation was for non-smoking. After calling reception and complaining to reception desk all the did is let me know that they don't have non-smoking rooms available for that night and that they cannot move me before next morning. I was moved next morning, but my whole clothes smelled of tobacco which was not pleasant when you have meetings next 2 days. New room was OK, even though seemed bit weary and reading so many great feedback I expected so much more.  Buffet breakfast is nice as…",2

It's a well appointed room with a great view but... @%#€ Come on Hyatt, this is not Grand standard.",2
1785,"Accommodation is v clean and spacious. Bathroom modern and strong shower. We were upgraded to a one bed from a deluxe suite which was a nice surprise. Fantastic views of the city. Location is OK although it's a walk to all attractions via train. Some good restaurants nearby.   Before we arrived I emailed to ask if they had gf options and if they could provide gf bread. I was surprised when I got a reply saying they didn't have anything and made clear they wouldn't get anything either.   I took my own bread and cereal as a result. Not a huge deal but most places these days are prepared to offer at least bread. They had yoghurt, cheese and ham etc so that helped.   ",4
1786,"Just returned from a 2 night stay at The Meyerhold Hotel, lovely hotel in the heart of the theatre land. Rooms are beautifully decorated and the bathrooms are a delight. Staff are all very welcoming and genuinely warm towards you and nothing it too much trouble. The hotel is ideally located for all local attractions and the metro us very close by.  One of the many nice things about the location is that it is very Parisian and not too many tourists in the area..which was lovely for us to feel involved in the Parisian way of life.  Everywhere we went, people in the bars restaurants etc were very friendly and welcoming. Would highly recommend this hotel.",5

My husband and I stayed for eight nights and found the entire experience awesome. The staff is professional, kind, courteous, and speaks English very well. The hotel is centrally located to the metro stations and is within walking distance of many of the attractions and cafes.   I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone that likes quaint and charming places with a European flavor.",5

My partner and I walked from the hotel, each day, to wherever we had planned to spend our morning. Hygiene was impeccable throughout the hotel (although we only ventured from the reception to our room) but still. I was disheartened to find the bar terrace on the roof was closed due to it being winter. Invest in some heaters and a canopy/gazebo/parasol! Would've loved to have seen the views. Also, there's no kettle or sachets of coffee/tea in the room, which isn't the end of the world when you're only on a short visit, but as a coffee addict it would've been nice not to pay 3 euro 5 times a day or so to get my fix. Another thing was the bed. Or…",4

Front desk will also help with taxis if needed but you can also download the G7 taxi app. Hotel staff were very nice and overall the hotel itself including the rooms were nice and clean. Only small thing was complimentary water bottle was only on the first night and there was no iron available one night for my work shirts the next day. However, they did get an iron and board back in the room as soon as they could! Thank you.",5

BUT   I am in a room that is without doubt the SMALLEST hotel room I have ever seen ( and I travel a lot). there are many joke phrases like ""couldn't swing a dead cat .... etc"" but how about this   I can't stand between the pan and the sink in a way that allows me to either shave or wash my face - seriously this is ridiculous. I dragged the manager up to show him ""that's the design"" was the response   Now the truth is the hotel is in a great venue, but it is simply not a hotel, or at least not one that should charge by the hour - no bar, no room service, no alarm call, no room to shave  My advice - park benches are cheaper do not stay here",1

The room, furnishing, linen etc were all tired and worn out. The bathroom was small, dark and didnt have much scope for ventilation. There living room had a balcony but all you can see is a wall just 100 metres away from you.  The staff and service was not just disappointing but one of the staff members also cheated us. We requested the reception to help us book the samba show. In my experience, most hotels do it as a service for the guests but the guy at the reception pocketed his commission from our booking!

Moved a third time to a room which had the shower clogged. The staff was most unpleasant in the interactions throughput. Some responses were: Oh there are lots of bugs all across the bed - we do not have any open rooms.  Housekeeping - They are termites and do not bite, you need to stay in the room and there is no other option.  Guest services - just seeing me approach on morning of check out - there is no late check-out available. Executive lounge attendent - Don't bother me with things that are over. Eat what is there. ",2

Sorry is: we put a note under your door.  Sorry is:  we post a sign in the elevator lobby.  Not doing any of those is inept, not sorry.  Left a message for the general manager.

So, no food or snacks at the pool. No drinks at the pool after 5pm. No restaurant food in the casual or outdoor areas (""because chef will get upset"" and ""because chef insists on food being served piping hot""). And - if you want to sit outside - four tables and mainly occupied by someone wanting a cigarette, beer and phone call. So - do as you're told and sit in a big, cold, indoor restaurant.

Room, in our opinion, is not very cozy. The bed in the suite, not very big for a king size bed, low and fall hard. We in advance a month earlier, booked a massage at the hotel spa.

However we decided to talk to the staff once again which had not only attitude problem but was also so unfriendly and didn't help us which he said he would. Next day we met the manager of the hotel who accommodated us to another room. All in…",2
1823,"Had heard great things about Aloft in general but this one in Chicago failed to deliver. Arrived in the evening and even though I had a reservation, they did not have a room for me. The young man at the desk seemed perplexed as to why this would be disappointing. Fail.",1
1824,"The pictures on the hotel site are very deceptive.  Rooms are nice, wide and clean, but have no décoration at all, its almost a dormitory.  Bathroom is poorly located within the room, claustrophobic and poorly lit and equipped.  Location is nice, but they do not let you know your car cannot get to their door.  Breakfast is nice, but... two days there listening to excruciating Portuguese hard rock, destroying the great view experience...  Front desk staff is extremely nice and helpful.",3
1825,"Very good location , friendly receptionist , nice decoration in room, many different restaurants and bars closeby . Comfortable free spa. Just a little bit noise in the early morning but it is in the city difficult to be avoided ",5
1826,"This hotel had everything to receive a 5* rating, as it is full of charming features and an original concept; also most of the staff is very polite, helpful and welcoming. BUT: - No way this hotel is in the Recoleta area. If anything, it's close to Downtown. - From day 1, the automatic front door was broken, and 5 days later, when we left, it hadn't yet been repaired. - Housekeeping was very careless, never taking out the trash from the bin of 1 of the rooms - Our non smoking rooms/floors had a constant strong smell of cigarettes. The glass enclosue of both rooms weren't properly sealed, so everyday after taking a shower, the bathroom floors got completely flooded. - Both rooms were in need of a ""face lift"", with faded headboards, narrow sheets that barely covered the king size…",2
1827,"Objective the rooms are very small, the bathroom is not so hot, I felt like I was at an alberg, nothing to do with a boutique hotel at all. I needed a room for four hours durring 6 and 10 am for another business partner flying all night,  I was charged fo a full day, besides getting an attitude for questioning. No question I will not say there again, for the prie and quality. ",2
1828,"Hotel easy to get to from the airport using the red line. Found it easy using Saldanha metro station. The area is easy for access to different areas of the city and there are eating places all around. The hotel is small, we had to change rooms but the staff where helpful. The room and bathroom were clean though the fridge was dirty . The beds were horrible two singles beds pushed together and mattresses where hard as a rock. Room had no coffee facilities apparently they are only provided in the suites. There was no iron too. Things you always expect in a 4 star hotel room. Tried the breakfast Buffett on the last day and the selection was good though coffee was awful. The WiFi was very good and fast. The Free massage was nice too.",3
1829,"I stayed at the Hotel Recamier for two nights in mid-December. I stayed in room 664 which has a very lovely terrace in which you can see the tip of the St. Sulpice church and some Parisian rooftops.  The room was tiny but very well appointed. The bathroom was large, with fluffy towels and robes. Breakfast was delicious--high quality pastries and juices. I didn't have a chance to try to the afternoon tea, as I was at work. The lobby and breakfast area were small but very elegant and charming.The location on the church plaza is quiet and pretty, yet walking distance to lots of shops and restaurants. My only quibble is that the reception gave me a recommendation for a creperie that was closed Sunday night, but luckily I found another place to eat nearby. The hotel is quite pricey,…",5
1830,"The staff at the reception desk  is very kind.His explanation is detailed and helpful.The breakfast buffet is the best ever which I have had.My daughters and wife really liked it.However, the sofa bed is a little inconvenient. Its center is a little  sunken.I forgot to say that: The location of the hotel cannot be better!",4
1831,"Wonderful hotel. Hotel staff were truly helpful. One of them, I think her name was Keiko Ota was instrumental to our amazing stay here at this hotel. She welcomed us with open arms and even showed us what local spots to hit. Will visit again next time I'm back in Paris!",5
1832,"Beware of this hotel if you are bringing a dog. Despite the hotel advertising itself as being pet-friendly through its ""Pets Are Welcome"" program, it is not.  Want to stay one night with your dog? That will be an extra $125 (yes, one hundred twenty-five dollars in addition to the room charge). We have driven cross country with our dog quite a bit, and their additional $100 fee (for ""deep cleaning"") is absolute BS. No other hotel that I've stayed at, to include other W Hotels, does this.  Also, do you see all of the amenities listed on the page for your pet? Yeah, they provided none of them. None. Not a single one. And when I raised this with management, they couldn't have cared less.",1

1835,"I stayed in this Hotel with my fiancee during the Easter break 2015 for 4 days. it was a very good stay mainly due to the comfort of the hotel, the friendliness of the staff. The Hotel is very well located 10mn wlak from the festival palace and ""la croisette"". There is plenty of restaurants around the Hotel, very affordable and good. The chambermaid was very friendly as well as the girls at the reception. Just one unfortunate point: we were on the same fllor than a noisy group of people and one night one of them (maybe mistakenly) knocked with insistance to our door. I think the hotel should look at this aspect carefully. Else than that, it was a perfect stay.",5
1836,"I loved this place! When I walked through the quaint garden courtyard where many were enjoying the atmosphere, I knew this was a good spot! We arrived before noon, but the owner was so friendly and gave us a room right away. Our room was small, but very clean, quiet, and cozy. We had a fridge with soft drinks provided, chocolates on our pillows, slippers, and a large bottle of water. These little things made me feel as if I was staying with friends! Oh and the bed was divine! Plus the location was perfect! Close to the promenade and to lots of shops and restaurants. Would definitely recommend this place! ",5
1837,"Service in the hotel (reception, bar and restaurant) was all ok - the location is good (metro, railways, shopping,..).- unfortunately, the facilities (rooms, gym, ...) are not at all on a decent Novotel level. We got a family room on the third floor - dirty carpet, broken shower head, smelly and windows can only be opened by housekeeping. In addition, pretty noisy as street in front and airplanes flying over the hotel for landing 2-3 minutes ahead of the airport. As a Accor Gold Member, I did not feel at home ... I am sure with a proper overall renovation, this hotel could become a very decent Novotel in the future.",3
1838,"We had a group of 28 missionaries stay at the Hotel Ipanema Inn in March 2014.  We stayed there for two days of excursion in Rio after our mission trip.  The hotel itself is very nice and located in a GREAT area of Ipanema and is less than one block from Ipanema beach and very close to restaurants and other food.  I spent months working with the reservation staff for our stay and to make sure everything worked correctly in advance.  Unfortunately, it all fell apart as soon as we arrived.    - we had sent all of our information in advance as to who was staying in what rooms AND how many beds we needed per room.  I confirmed this the day before as well and was assured all was in order.  However, five out of our 14 rooms only had one bed when we had specifically requested two beds…",2
1839,"Good location but as long as you don't need to sleep your good. We had double beds and they were like sleeping on the floor, our daughter slept on the pullout and said said it felt like daggers all night. Otherwise great place but due to the beds we will not return again.",1
1840,"Like many things; you get what you pay for - and so paying run of the mill prices means run of the mill rooms.   The check-in was painless and the reception was clean and friendly.  The rooms themselves were basic, but once again clean and modern and had no issues here.   Location wise, it's a few minutes walk to anything more than apartments or a corner shop - but within 10 minutes you are in the heart of the city so there's no real problem there at all. ",4
1841,"My friend and I stayed for two nights in this quaint hotel and it really was a great experience. The staff were fantastic and helpful . The room was clean, well appointed and very quiet. The bathrooms appear to have been recently renovated and is surprisingly spacious. The location is so great...we walked to Eiffel Tower, Champs-Elysees , the War/Military Museum, the Sienne River, and it is about 15 minutes walk to the Louvre. The continental breakfast was lovely- yogurt, croissants, pastries, bread and jams, fresh orange juice , coffee/tea/hot chocolate. They will deliver it to your room or you can have it in the small lobby area.  I would recommend this hotel ....it really is a great place to stay.",5
1842,"I have been there for 3 nights. Hotel got perfect location, in terms of close proximity to public transportation and modern areas as well. Our 3 bed room was spacious enough and the bathroom and beds were neat, but unfortunately we have always every day asked them to put shampoo and other sanitary materials, such as surprising issue in a 4 star hotel!!  Hotel was rebuilt, so interior parts are ok but coridors are old, lifts are tight and also you have to luck the room by key!! Not card!! In year 2019 in berlin in a 4star hotel!!  Reception and housekeeping members were so kind. They have always helped us to find locations on map and also answered our requests, especialy for shampoo, tissue and soaps, OMG!!  Hotel has a small lobby with 2 chairs and also you can find FANTASTIC…",4
1843,"Situated a very short walk from the marina, bars and restaurants and not too far from Las Ramblas. Room was very clean, spacious but the shower was a fiddly little bugger to use. Staff were very good and the breakfast very nice. Even though the area was quite bustling it's a quiet place.",4
1844,"There is nothing really to say about this hotel...The hotel is dirty, the elevator was dirty but the worst thing was the food. They include buffet breakfast which consitited of cold and tiny selection of disgusting slop. Worst food i have ever eaten!!!!!!!!!  To top this all off there was revovations going on all morning and were woken up by house keeping barging into our room at 7am while we were still asleep in bed!!!  Would not recommend staying there especially for the price. Highly recommend The Palace Hotel in Rach Gia, $20 a night, amazing food and great staff.",1
1845,"As much as I wanted to like this hotel, everything from how the rooms are misrepresented on the website to the rancid service just made it impossible to find any ounce of redeeming qualities about the place. For starters, prior to the trip, I sent an email to their contact listed on the website several times but received no response. When we got there, and checked into our supposedly 'upgraded suite', we were highly disappointed that it looked nothing like what we have seen on the website. The television set did not work, and the window had a thick film of dirt on it.   What particularly annoyed us was that even the phone did not make sense. At any normal hotels you would assume that dialing '0' would take you to the operator, but at Waterhouse, it is some long digit extension,…",2
1846,"Let me begin by saying the buildings and facilities at the property are lovely. This was marred however by the fact that my husband and I are 95% sure that we got food poisoning from a seafood tower at the properties restaurant. I am aware food borne illness can take up to 36 hours to develop but during this period of time this was the only meal that my husband and I shared (Greatly increasing the probability that it occured during this particular meal). I could actually forgive the poisoning if we were treated well after I reported it but we were not. When I informed the manager that we were up all night sick and I said that I was pretty sure it was the food from Azure he actually laughed at me and wanted a food history from my last 2 days, (when it is just as likely to happen…",2
1847,"I stayed last year in this hotel but didn’t like it. I was put in a very odd room, narrow and long. After many trips keeping going to my usual hotel (Sofitel, formerly The Brick) I decided to give Panamericano another chance. Never again. There isn’t something really wrong with this place, it’s just that there is a whole bunch of better options out there. Service is OK, breakfast also, but the rooms are dated, not clean, mold on the wall in the bathroom’s wallpaper, etc. They put a couple of water bottles the first day but there were never replaced afterwards. Toiletries are of a very low quality. In sum, this is more like a good 3 stars hotel rather than a 4 or 5 stars. So adjust your expectations, and don’t be fooled by the nice lobby.",2

Nice large rooms, air conditioning, large openable windows, electric blinds, black-out blind in the bedroom. Kitchen area with cooker hob, fridge, freezer, coffee maker. Bathroom with fantastic shower and washing machine.  Loads of storage space - wardrobes and drawers in the bedroom, plenty in the bathroom and in the main sitting room.  Small swimmming pool on the top floor, with small gym and spa.  Good, friendly bar. All in all a great stay.",4
1849,"My “double room for single use” was on the 6th floor. It was big, very clean and very modern. Wood floor, plenty of storage space for clothes and other stuff, mini bar, and a bathroom with everything you might need - from a tooth brush to a bath robe. You can literally leave your toiletry bag at home.  There was no street noise at night at all (I always sleep with a window open).  The breakfast buffer is very impressive, very rich and top quality. Fresh juice, Nespresso coffee machines, daily changing items. All you want.  Only complaint is the in room tv only has 2 English speaking channels and they’re both news channels (bbc world and bloomberg).  Service was nice, everyone was courteous and smiling. This was my 2nd visit to the hotel and I am looking forward to visiting it…",5
1850,Hotel is looks good on paper but thats all. The rooms have farm doors so absolutely NO privacy at all. The windows were taped with black plastic. We were not informed that the building was being painted so ot was very uncomfortable waking up to men outside the windows. You can hear everything in the hallways. No sound sleep at all  The only nice thing was the decor and game room.,1
1851,"It would be easy to write a bad review about this hotel, because it truly deserves it. But here's the dilemma: The staff that work here and look after guests are absolutely the best I've ever experienced. But to share useful information with potential guests I have to be honest about the facility overall.  First of all, the hidden 'resort' fee that nobody likes to talk about until you try and check out. It runs to about $36 a day. As you can see from the hotel's responses on other reviews they claim this is for ""multitude of amenity and discount offers"", ""in-room Starbucks Coffee"" and free wifi. The reality - in my opinion, this is an unpleasant scam to dip the guest for more money. It provides zero real value to the guest when compared to other hotels.  Drilling down a bit -…",1

I had been extending my stay each day and one day they said there was a group coming and they didnt have a place for me. I was immediately suspicious of this because some of the staff had been treating me in an unwelcoming way for a few days - starting from when I complained, very gently I thought, about something.   I suspect they were also getting scared because I was asking for the name of the owner.   In any case they sent me to another one of their hostels, refusing to call first for me --- they assured me there would be space there. But guess what - they also had a ""group"" coming. I asked…",2
1853,This place was disgusting. It looks nothing like the pictures! My husband and I had a room with stained sheets and people were screaming outside of our room all night. It's in a sketchy part of town and we had to scrub the toilet before we sat down on it😰 SPEND THE MONEY ON A NICER PLACE. ,1

Also u will hear the elevator bell every few minutes during the night. If u put the please do not disturb sign at the door, they still will knock on the door and ask you! The toilet was leaking as well!  So if you want a good rest, then do Not stay here! ",2

I took exception to this rule, stating that everywhere else we have stayed, under the same conditions, we have never been presented with this rule- since our animals are serve animals, not pets.  The hotel was correct, our animals should always be under our control, this was not entirely the issue- it was how the situation escalated and the manner in which we were treated. It went from receptionist, to shift supervisor, to hotel manager, to hotel director, Torrance, who had zero sensitivity.  I understand there are a lot of people that abuse the ADA standards of service animals, we were not that…",1

Also I booked apartment more than 1 month in advance, and I was thinking deposit  would happen 3 days before check-in, but it happened 1 month before check-in.  This was also a big trouble to me because I couldn't expense it until I check-in the apartment. Facilities and staff are not bad, but customer service is also not good. They didn't clean up the floor(there are small rubbish on the floor), shampoo/soap were not charged often so I needed to save these, etc.",2

We were taken up to our room - the shower door did not open; the TV did not work; and only 1 chair in a double room.We informed reception; shower could not be repaired; TV could not be repaired; a 2 nd chair was brought from another room. We were then offered an alternate room the floor above, but were given no assistance to move.

1859,On a 10 day so so Insight tour they saved the best for last. We stayed an extra night and it was cheap as...  Been really angry that all six hotels apart from two have turned the heating off. These are four and five star hotels for heaven's sake and they’re too mean to leave the heating on even when it’s seven degrees outside.  Dom Pedro is no exception which is why they get three stars. Should be five but that’s their own fault. A quite angry Australian/Scotsman went down to reception and demanded heating. This time it worked and a small space heater was brought in... bliss!   Breakfast was the best yet with top class waiters. The room was beautiful with a huge king size bed. Ooh that heating is kicking in again!   The spa/pool looks brilliant with colour changes in the pool.…,3

Upon arrival I was informed that the spa was out of service... I had only booked a few days earlier so this info should have def been on the website ! And if they can’t do that, they can at least contact all customers who are due to arrive and inform them that one of the services they are paying for is not available and give them the option to go elsewhere, which I would have done as this was a very important factor for me.  The rooms were modern, clean and well designed. On the small side and pillows very uncomfortable (for me anyway) but I appreciate how well thought out the design process was in every room.

Reading , reading , reading and finally our choice for our 10th anniversary was Hotel Corinthia - a five stars hotel described by the others  FABULOUS. Well there is nothing fabulous about this place apart the nice lounge which gives you the feeling of a nice hotel. We booked a Deluxe Queen room which was so small and plain. The same brown old furniture , a smell of mould coming from the wardrobe, lots of pieces of paper on the table but not even a flower ( probably a plastic one will do).

Our room was a decent size, with a TV, desk, good sized bathroom, and my favour part, an Espresso coffee machine! All seemed 10/10; better than we could have imagined.  However, our view from the room was a bit disappointing as we looked onto nearby buildings and the metro track. Although, at least that meant that we could walk to the metro with ease.

It is also some 100 metres from the restaurant, in a separate building. The bedrooms are above the restaurant hence guests tended to go straight up to their rooms after finishing the evening buffet.

You can hear the people in the next room very clearly when they are just talking. You can here neighbors in the bathroom almost like they are in the same room. Management copped out when I brought to attention claiming I should have said something when I checked in and refused to make the situation right. I don't know how they got all these great reviews. There was no way I was going to disturb or cause a scene in front of my 7 year old daughter.

Too bad I did not have time to talk with general manager about the history of the hotel. Location is approximately 500 meters from the nearest station  Pillows could be better.

All of the staff were so friendly, welcoming and helpful when advising us on places to eat or the best travel routes to get to where we wanted to go. The hotel was in a great location and was just a 10 minute walk to Gare du Nord and a few minutes walk to a metro station. Our room and its facilities were great, spacious and also very clean.

The receptionist's first question was, if it was raining, not very sensitive. She followed up, trying to sell us an upgrade, because she thought the bed may be too small for us (we are both average to athletic size).

The furniture is modern with glass dining table with four chairs and a small living room with TV with a cool balcony over looking the street and Gaudi house.

I wouldn’t recommend sharing a room with strangers however unless you’re not too particular about your privacy and have no trouble sleeping through annoying people coming and going at all hours making lots of noise. Location was great amenities were great. The constant club music was annoying especially in the morning. It Would have been nice if there were a more chill playlist at that hour. Music is important and can set a mood and effect a clear message about your establishment. It was a missed opportunity generator. It made this young hip place seem stale and out of touch.,4

The last time I was here, 6 years ago, I stayed with another hotel and found it warm, welcoming and very ""Hawaiian"". Unfortunately this time I felt like I was anywhere else in the world. The Hilton are a large chain and unfortunately, while ""nice"", it's generic and doesn't really have the Hawaiian ""feel"". Upon check in I was told while we had breakfast included during the booking process, this did not include our 2 year old baby. I was not happy and expressed this at the front desk and the lady then refused to talk to me and made conversation with my wife. She did supposedly upgrade us but our baby still ate off our plate each morning. Oh well, I gave them an opportunity to fix…",2
1881,"I stayed here for three nights with my son, I booked a package deal with BA  We arrived late but staff were very accommodating   We had a basic room which was not ideal as only had a small double bed , I tried to change to a twin room but this would have incurred a £30 per night surcharge   The room was small but clean with all amenities, only thing I didn't like was the glass door to the bathroom which was rather disconcerting!  Breakfast was libel and the pool area although v small was fine  We were allowed a late check out on the day if our departure which was helpful   It was a 5 min taxi ride to the port but walking distance to many other attractions  I would definately stay here again thank you ",4

1883,"We stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel is close to the port, a short walk to the beach and to the metro station and there is a bus stop outside the hotel. The room and bathroom were large and very clean although could do with updating. It would have been nice to have tea and coffee making facilities in the room. The staff were very friendly and helpful in informing us the best way to get around the city.",4
1884,"Great suburban location beside the Birkenstrasse U-bahn for easy transfer into city centre attractions. Lots of bars and cafes closer by which provide good breakfast and drinks options to the hotel. Hotel is located inside a shopping complex so doesn’t look like much from the outside. Inside it is modern, clean and well appointed. Rooms are fairly spacious with good WiFi.  Bathrooms are very small (hard to close the door if using the toilet) and the AC is a bit weak which might be an issue in the height of summer. Note: the bathrooms only have shower and no tub although the shower is very good. We had a good 2 night stay in 2 rooms until we encountered an extremely rude lady on he front desk when we checked out. Such a shame - even her colleague was embarrassed by her attitude.…",4
1885,"Terrible experience as LHW member. No doorman upon arrival Lady in reception VERY unfriendly and cold and really not giving us ANY extra for status. Name of Girl Alina. No room upgrade (ok MAYBE Hotel in middle of week in MAY is SO full). No name on envelope letter from Manager, as ""welcome gift"" just one strawberry, one tiny macaron, and one chocolate (see picture). No complimentary water (water came with afternoon service at 6PM! not on arrival). When back to Hotel after only one hour receptionist Alina (her again)  asked us room number (shouldn't be excellent LHW know guests name by heart?. No parking (our car has been parked in the street downstairs. Actually the housekeeping people were nicer and friendlier than RECEPTIONIST ALINA.",2

1887,"The Richmond is a rundown hotel where no one answers the phone.  Are room was one of the worst rooms I have ever stated in.  The phone did not work, the windows would not stay up (had to use a magazine), and the blinds would not stay up (had to rap the cord around the left side).  the baseboard was about an inch off the floor on the right side of the room as if the floor was settling.  The room was old and dirt as well as the hotel.  Worst of all, the waitress forged a $15.47 tip for the crappy free breakfast.  I left a message for the manager, but he will not return my call.  Save your money and stay at a nice hotel.",1
1888,This hotel is conveniently located near the bus and train station. Comfy beds and very clean. Staff very friendly. The space for breakfast is inadequate and it gets crowded and you feel you are sitting on top of one another. Get there early or no breakfast! There is a reasonable selection for breakfast and they top up regularly.,4
1889,We very much enjoyed the central location of the Hotel Bikini and we were given a warm welcome by the receptionist. Our room which we were told had a Zoo view just looked across some large roofs with some trees in the background which was hardly a Zoo view. The room had a good double bed on the floor and a fair sized bathroom and shower. But a few niggles like a bedside lamp that was not working - nor was the illuminated globe that would not light up. The big bath with build in music speakers was a great success. We felt that breakfast for about €20 each was a little expensive and actually it was ok but not really worth that much. I think the concept of Hotel Bikini is good but it needs a  refurbishment as it is looking a little tired at the edges. Finally the guy a the…,4

The parking lot is a headache it' is old ND confusing ( to get to the parking lot next 3 rights on ellis st) OK? No one was there greeting. Then when I finally took my car over the lot they said its 77 dollars for valet 77$ per night!! And 67 for self parking. It's ridiculous and you cannot park your car on a different parking lot because the area is ghetto dirty and a bunch of homeless walking around there's trash everywhere so bad o wouldn't recommend this hotel.

I was in San Francisco on a business trip and my first morning when I headed out I borrowed an umbrella in case it rained but, after checking the forecast, returned the umbrella to the front desk. Flash forward to 3:30 PM and the hotel has left me a voicemail asking me when I will be back to pick up my luggage and check out of my room! I rushed back to the hotel to find that the housekeeper has started preparing my room for the next guest and the hotel has checked me out of my room a day early. When I followed up at the front desk, they said that my request for an umbrella was somehow interpreted as me checking out of the hotel! When I…",1

We were disappointed that we paid for a lake view only to find the room ( room 207 ) window filthy and inhabited by spiders. Our second issue related to free parking. There is a covered parking garage which is too small for the volume of cars and parking is difficult due to the presence of numerous large pillars. The next problem involved bugs, though neither of us received any bites. On the second day of our stay we noticed numerous small flying insects in the bathroom. We reported this to the front desk and were assured that it would be taken care of while we were out of the hotel that morning. When we returned the insects were still…",1

I have stayed at different hotels in Copacabana and Ipanema and I love making comparison between hotels which are in the same price and star range. Location of Grand Mercure is perfect, just meters away from Copacabana beach. The check-in process was long with lots of information requested and long queues of guests waiting. I have received a room in Bloco B which is clearly not the right place to be. The room is really huge but from the moment I entered the room until I left it the next day a strong smell of mold made my stay very unpleasable. The furniture seen better times and the safe was in a very poor condition. I was very dissapointed with the room received but…",2

This place has excellent transport links to city centre,staff were very friendly, room was very clean, bed was comfy, the air conditioning was a godsend during the 30 degree heat and breakfast was lovely.

1896,"So much going on with this hotel, literally.  When you first arrive, you are taken aback by the decor - which is not for everyone.  I'm not really sure who it is for - the design is ultra modern but it's still a hotel.  The chairs are not comfortable in the lobby or the bar and the general atmosphere is more ""in your face"" then design.  As for the service, we are Hyatt Members, which they don't seem to care about - so that didn't go far.  We arrived at 2:30 and told our room wouldn't be ready until 3:00.  One person in our party was ill, but no additional accommodation could be made.  I've stayed at 5 star hotels all over the world and this seem absurd, we had to wait 30 minutes?  How much cleaning could be done in 30 minutes?  When I room still wasn't ready at 3:00 - we said we…",3

When I spoke with the person on the phone and explained my need for a room with double beds there was never any mention of construction on your facility nor did your employee tell me that neither your restaurant, bar and or gym were functional.   From the minute we pulled up in front of your hotel the special weekend trip for me and my 15 year old son quickly disintegrated.  The front of your hotel was blocked with construction crews and trucks.  I did laps around the block in the car while my son called the front desk asking for valet.  No one ever answered his call and so I was forced to park in traffic and walk our bags in, all the while blocking the cable cars.  My sons comment…",1

We got lovely red velvet cup cake plate as welcome surprise and a kind note from general manager. Next day with breakfast delivery we got lovely birthday cake. These details, souvenirs and mementos are exactly why I want to stay loyal to Waldorf Astoria brand. They make you feel pampered and well taken care of. Why only 4 stars this time? It took almost an hour and a phone call to get our luggage delivered to our room.",4
1902,"Discreet, stylish, bright. In a classic Parisian building with the original details but with a contemporary feel, Hotel Arvor is a special independent hotel with a great eye for design and art. It is in the lovely location of Saint Georges, close to the foodie rue des martyrs, nightlife of pigalle and a short walk up to the Sacre Coeur. ",5

Smoking rooms available.",2

Meeting accommodation is very good, although a bit warm. Having lunch and diner is what you expect from a business hotel. The location is really nice on the border of the charming river Spree. There are a couple of boat restaurants near by! You should ask for a room with a view on the river.",4

When he realized hi didn’t apologized for his mistake. My senior uncle didn’t find the AC button and the room was freezing, he called to the front desk to ask for help and he was rude with him. After I called to and he was rude with me telling me that the button was there. I told him that senior people where in there and that they couldn’t find it and he didn’t care. He didn’t send someone. My uncle just woke up with a flu because of this.  For sure I will sue the hotel and this guy.",1

We stayed in apartment 6 which had a balcony away from the street. The apartment was spacious, spotless and very comfortable.  Nice furniture on the balcony to enjoy the warm weather. Kitchen furnished with everything you could want.  The only negative was the noise from inside the building.

Metro system is super easy and the girls at the front desk were extremely helpful, as a 26 yr old female travelling alone I felt very comfortable!   I had room 607 - shower was nice and hot and there is temperature control in the room. Room is small but hello this is Paris we're talking about!  Room was a bit dark (dark green paint), so my only suggestion would be to perhaps brighten up the room with a lighter shade :-) My windows opened to the courtyard (no view but it was nice and quiet for sleep)!  Oh, the final floor (fl.6) is only accessible by stairs, so if you can't do stairs for whatever reason…",5
1914,We had a very bad experience at the Marriott Marquis during a recent business trip which included my wife accompanying me.  There were some positives...the grounds by the pool are very nice and of course the marina location is beautiful.    The hotel is very large but lacks any type of central lobby - the north tower has a small lobby area while the south tower has only the restaurant.  The executive lounge is in the south tower which is VERY inconvenient for those in the North tower as we were.  I visited the executive lounge twice - once late and once early.  I was very unimpressed both times.  The food was mediocre at best and the lounge is severely undersized for the hotel.    We tried the food three times - all of them were unimpressive.  The restaurant's expensive food was…,2

After traveling for 14 hours, had to wait for 3 women at front desk to help one man-- talking, joking, kept me waiting to check in. Then 2 of them went on lunch break-- the third answered phone call, infuriating me. Finally 20 min later, with steam coming out of my ears they checked me in. Trying to find parking garage is not easy-- mostly non-marked one way streets (oh, we forgot to tell you u have to drive into another hotel to turn!!)  Forget eating in the IHOP in the hotel-- its the biggest rip-off on Oahu-- over $20 per meal (yes, for pancakes only!!) Our room was facing ocean, but alas we couldnt see it because the high rises and parking garage in front of us. I imagine even the highest…",2

They told us best way to get to places, tram, subway train etc. Breakfast was continental and there was plenty to choose from, the breakfast area can be very busy. Rooms were fine, large bed and great shower. The rooms are open plan.  The main road outside the hotel is very busy and very noisy. Please bear this in mind when booking. I don't want to see any negative reports on here about the noise....ask for a room on a high floor......",4

I stayed for an event in the area and it is a events or business type hotel.     Our rooms were clean and the beds comfortable.  But I  really missed being able to make a cup of tea (there were no tea making facilities at all) and there was no drinking water provided in the rooms.  There was no iron in the room and the hairdryer wasn't brilliant.  There was the usual toiletries you would expect, but nothing to give it an edge,  Breakfast was a nice mix and there was some thing for everyone.     It was a good hotel but it didn't have the wow factor for £138 per night.",3
1918,Hotel was under construction during our stay which was never communicated.  They had us on the same floor the work was being done. Not sure why they wouldn't have communicated that when we checked in at 1:30 am after flight delays.  I called FD and requested another room which they accommodated.  Unfortunately they placed us above the construction instead of on other side of hotel.  Doesn't take much to find a solution aka a room a bit further away from the noise!,1

1921,"A small hotel with loads of style and character. Modern touches mixed with antiques, wide wooden floors, Oriental carpets, dark textured wallpaper...you get the picture. We stayed in Room 18, which was large, had an antique iron bed, tons of drawer space, a big modern bathroom with a stall shower and windows that opened. It did face the street and with the windows opened you got some early morning noise. There was no heated towel bar in the bathroom...other than that, perfect. Good walkable neighborhood with several very good restaurants nearby. We liked the Rutz wine bar and Petrarca for excellent authentic Italian. Helpful young women at the front desk, good breakfast spread at the adjoining restaurant and a great housekeeping team. We felt very much at home at the Honigmond.",4

The website for this hotel says only one child under the age of twelve with existing bedding.  We have a three year old and an infant, neither of whom need existing bedding - we travel with what we need.  The person answering the phone stated that we cannot reserve the Parlor Suite regardless of bedding needs.  He claims it is a ""safety issue.""  Only one child is allowed.  Unfortunate. Just odd that this hotel is highly rated for families.",1

I asked for a manager who came out and didn't look much concerned and found someone to assist me.  After checking in, there was no one interested in assistance with my bags (nor could they be bothered when I can through the doors).

I had some really inconsiderate and creepy roommates (which doesn't have a lot to do with the hostel). The location is good, 5 minutes to the beach, supermarket, shops.  The bathroom could have been cleaner and the shower drains were slightly blocked so the water didn't drain properly.

Looks like the staff is not any more caring  about cleaning the gym machines after people sweat on it and the changing room + sauna + jacuzzi is definitely lacking of hygiene and maintenance (hairs in showers, sauna broken floor and dirty jacuzzi).

However, we tried to book a table for the Kukbuk restaurant and were informed that the restaurant was fully booked for the whole week! My wife and I are both disabled and because we could not eat in the hotel we had to walk in the rain to the closest eating house. This Hotel should not advertise the facility of a restaurant.

Our luggage was taken to our rooms, whist we ate lunch in the relaxing bar area.

Leading on from the bathroom, we entered a study area which included two arm chairs and a desk , and a television. There was a dividing wall leading to a large bedroom with twin beds and another television.  both bedroom and living room area - had large window with patio/seated area outside.

It is newer and more modern as compared to the Pudong Shangri-La which I've stayed a few times.  But the service here is pretty disappointing. First, I was given a wrong room while checking in. This to me is pretty serious. I walked into an occupied room. I don't suppose anyone would like being intruded like this. It also raises security issues with regards to our belongings. It could have been an honest mistake, but its a serious one. Second, I was given different check out timings by different staff, which was confusing. Third, I had problems with the internet and none of the technical staff…",2

The hotel and everyone we dealt with were efficient and courteous, celebrating a special birthday on arrival reception immediately informed us of upgrading both rooms to superior, thank you again. Rooms were situated to the side of the hotel on the 6th floor with ample space and the added bonus of an expansive terrace. Cleanliness was excellent and cannot be faulted, not only in bedrooms but throughout the hotel. The choice of self service breakfast caters for all with everything you could wish for. Restaurant staff were efficient and obviously highly trained to cater for their clients. We enjoyed drinks and cocktails served at the hotel bar, again very good service. The hotel is quietly…",4
1945,"We chose this Hotel because of it's location close to shops, restaurants and the metro. This was very good, however the staff on the front desk were not good. No information or advice with regards to trips/eating places/ or accessing interesting places. They did not take bookings for visitor trips or even have leaflets telling us about what was on offer in Lisbon. The room was OK but the toilet door would have been much nicer if it had closed properly and not had a gap top and bottom. There wasn't anywhere to hang wet towels and you had to leave the toilet area walk round the bedroom to the washbasin to wash your hands. Hygienic??",3
1946,"We visited in non-peak season so it could be different in peak but the hotel was very quite and relaxing. Prices were very reasonable.  They recognized my marriot status with a sea view upgrade as well as free breakfast and wifi.    The pool area has an excellent menu and direct access to the beach, though it is down a steep set of stairs. there is also a nice field for playing futbol. Proximity to Obidos makes for a great day trip and its just an hour and a half drive to Lisbon. ",3

No price sheet, indication it wasn't included in the room (along with soap, towels and the like) well it wasn't and not only that but they charged $8.70 for the bottle of water and $4 for the bar.   See bill. I protested that there were no prices or anything to indicate that it wasn't part of the room.   Implacable front desk personnel didn't care.   ",1

The walls in our room had blood smeared on it, the sink backed up the shower backed up (we had to turn on the water, turn it off soap up, and then turn it back on to wash off or else we were in stagnent water), and the beds were squeaky, hot, and itchy. The whole place smelled AWFUL, and I could hear everyone through the doors walls etc , it was ridiculous. I got WHAT i paid for, at 60 dollars a night I will never make that mustake again. And what is up with all the Ghetto trash hanging around there, maybe it was the local or maybe it was south beach, it was TERRIBLE.",1

After the stay the smell penetrated into all my clothes and belongings. Wrinkled bed sheets and a thin blanket (requires heating at nights). Walls are extremely thing - you can hear your neighbours coughing and talking.  Breakfast is more of a joke, but perhaps it makes some people happy, so I won't comment on it. Neighbourhood is awful - moving towards the Union Square you have to walk through 4-5 blocks full of homeless, junkies, drug dealers etc.  Very unfriendly and arrogant young male receptionist (others were nice though).

Then when wanting to use the bath tub, the plug didn't hold the water in, so therefore couldn't take a bath.  2nd evening we were welcomed back to our 8th floor room to a strong smell of sewage coming from the bathroom drain.

We received absolutely no customer service, not even a greeting upon entering the hotel with our arms full of suitcases and bags. Receptionist ignored us until we said that we were here to check in.

Fix the menu. Price increase? Change the menu. But when a customer sees his bill and asks the bartender why he was charged $12 for an item that is clearly marked $7 on the menu, absolutely do not shrug it off and say ""Yeh, that's wrong, they all really $12.""

We had to waste more time checking back in (the second time) and then said the complimentary upgrade the room we were confirmed having was since booked.

I'm usually understanding of mistakes, and this Novotel makes plenty of them, but it's their poor handling of problems that makes this hotel terrible. Everyone in our group had their own horror stories to tell of the place. (eg, spending hours, arguing over a messed up reservation.) We thought that the price premium, 2-3x more expensive than a comparable 4-star hotel room, would include the quality of service you'd expect from an Accor Novotel but despite the higher price, the service is noticeably worse than the (4-star) norm for Vietnam.",2

The location is great, a 10 minute walk to Potsdamer Platz and 20 minutes to Brandenburg Gate at a leisurely pace. S Bahn stop right across the street.

The hostel experience was good. It was clean and tidy. The beds were good. The best part is that you have 2 USB ports as well as reading light for everyone's bed. The  toilets and shower rooms were good. However, it is pretty expensive. No additional amenities like free tea and coffee. Not even free water for the guests.

2000,"Good structure, average price for the structure, still not cheap. Far from most touristic spots, but very close to Camp Nou, and University Zone. Breakfast not included. Small building, but good acomodations and good size bathroom.",4
2001,"Me and my girlfriend stayed here for 4 nights. The hotel was very good; large and clean rooms, good breakfast, frendly and helpfull staff and a really good location close to public transport (100 m) and a large supermarket (150 m).",5
2002,"I pre-paid my reservation at this hotel several weeks before I was planning to travel.  Approximately ten days before my trip, I received an email that the hotel had oversold rooms and that my reservation was being cancelled.  I was offered no compensation and there is no longer any availability at a reasonable price range within San Francisco for these dates.  My flights were purchased several weeks ago, so I cannot cancel or move my trip at this point without incurring great expense.  I am extremely angry with both the Laurel Inn and the booking site (amoma.com), which I located through TripAdvisor.  I will be filing complaints with the Better Business Bureau against all three of these entities.  Book here at your peril!",1
2003,Very good location - decorative - rooms very pleasant  - beds  - very comfortable  Breakfast should be included -  staff excellent - order your own taxi - It would be helpful to have a barman - I will be returning - ,5
2004,"Hardware is good but software sucks. This hotel has nice amenities and room facilities but still don’t expect to get expected good service. During checkin, they could not find out booking as they have communication breakdown with our travel agents. We waited for 45 min to get our rooms. Our plan included free mini bar but we found out it was empty inside room. We asked staff to refill the mini-bar, but they answered they have to check with our agents first. They later found out we were right but they did nothing till we insisted and they give 2 cans of coke (lol) for day one.  We found it was hot inside room but the air conditioner send out hot air even you set ‘cold’ at temperatures 16C .  All windows are fixed and we could not open. We complained but their answer were it was…",2

2006,"Good location, can walk to many of the interesting sites of the city and a metro stop right outside.  Professional, friendly front desk. Well equipped room but getting tired. Old fashion decor and shabby around the edges.   Small bar. Didn't try the restaurant, prefer local independents. ",3
2007,"I went to Shanghai with my family during this chinese new year and at the time of booking the hotel, I thought its time we try a local chinese chain of hotels, so i booked this SSAW hotel in a Executive City View Room. Firstly, when we arrived at the hotel with my wife and 4 month old baby, we had to wait for someone to open the door, put our luggage on the trolley, to take it inside the hotel. The hotels entrance looked desolate. When we went to the room, there was no bath tub as described in the picture, so i spoke with them to clarify. Then they changed our room to another one on 3rd floor. Furthermore, all was okay until we decided to sleep. Firstly, the room was stuffy with no ventilation, we tried to switch on the AC as it was getting hot inside the room. When we turned on…",2
2008,"I have stayed at this property since 1995.  Used to be owned and managed by a Sinapore company and was terific.   Ownership is now Chinese and it shows.  The weather hot and humid but no (or very little) air con in the room.  Typical Chinese cheapa cheapa management.  The lobhy and lounge air con was every cool (actually cold) but to save money they reduce air con in the rooms.  When you complain ""oh we will change your room"" typical Chinese BS as changing the room does nothing.  They finally sent an ""engineer"" who adjusted the expanion valve and suddenly it worked better - not great but better.    WIFI was basicaly useless- had to use my SIM card for mobile internet access.  Their system is terrible.  The staff overall is good and the cafe food very good service by staff always…",2
2009,"The hotel is located in a quiet street, not to far from main avenues like Rambla de Catalunya. Service is good, room is not really what you'd expect from a 5 stars, which is more like modern minimalist.",4
2010,"The lady helping us at the reception was particularly helpful and friendly (big thumbs up to her!! don't know her name, but she had black hair haha). The hotel was clean, cozy and super close to Champs Elysees. We had a room with a terrace, beautiful view. The room was big, clean and had everything you'd need. I particularly enjoyed the Maison Margiela Jazz Club toiletries, which makes me want to get the Eu de Toilette! :)",5
2011,"A clean, comfortable hotel at a perfect location for a Weekend-in-Berlin tourist. Just a few minutes walk from Alexanderplatz where you have a hub of subway, and train lines. Really good breakfast but crowded when we were there. So crowded that there was a long line (several minutes) for the coffee machine. It made really good coffee but perhaps it would have been a good idea to also have a pot of regular black coffee to save people from getting a nervous breakdown first thing in the morning.",4
2012,"Metro accessible, walkable to Eiffel Tower (and a GREAT view of it from our window, which opens)! Prince at the front desk was a gem, making our trip so much better by making helpful thoughtful suggestions.",5
2013,"A great place: very friendly staff, fabulous rooms that are quiet, spacious and clean and excellent food!Suggestions for improvement are: please equip the rooms with a Minibar (can be put in by request!), a safe and please offer some alternatives for milk products at breakfast plus I missed a smoothie there. All in all, I really enjoyed my stay and will love to come back. 👍🏻",4
2014,"We truly enjoyed our stay at this lovely small hotel. The staff was exceptional, thinking of every detail to make our stay enjoyable - including great restaurant recommendations and arranging for a stress free room change.The breakfast and afternoon refreshments were a perfect way to start and end the day. We had the pleasure of staying in a room with terrace and enjoyed the magnificent sunsets over Paris rooftops. Fantastic location.",5
2015,"First of all, the map for this is wrong. The address is right, but this is in West Berlin almost next door to the Zoo Berlin and the Aquarium. The location is absolutely perfect for getting around, sightseeing, restaurants, trains to the airport, etc.  The apartments are very nice and modern with plenty of room. We also used the laundry facilities which were good, but maybe a little expensive. The reception staff were always very friendly and helpful and even printed out the train times and details for us for our early morning train to the airport.  The only thing that really let this place down was that we had ordered a cot with our booking and even rang and double checked three days before arriving that it would definitely be in the room as we were due to arrive on a day when…",4
2016,"Location is very convenient, close to Congonhas Airport and some good restaurants. Unfortunately that is the only thing I can say was good during the night I spent there. The hotel is in a desperately need for a renovation. But what really gets me was the reception: 45 minutes waiting for a room! The room I got was spacious, but extremely impersonal and faceless (even for a hotel) and the rug was utterly old and also a little bit dirty. I have no words to exactly describe the bathroom.  Sanitary metal fittings were at least not in good shape, as well as towels. Finally, bathing myself with cold water early in the morning was definitely not a happy ending for my stay. PS:  With the exception of the orange cake (in fact it was a passion fruit cake), breakfast, which is served in a…",2
2017,"We somehow had not come back to Paris in more than a decade...and we could not have found a better hotel to stay for three nights in late June.  The location is lights out.  The actual hotel is rather small but had all needed  services, including a great porter. The two wonderful women who were on the front desk could not have been nicer or more thoughtful.  The breakfast was great.  I am running out of superlatives.  And we are planning our return — here— soon.",5
2018,"There were no sheets on the bed when we arrived. Bad communication. No parking. Then they charge us $35 to park. No where to change. Can't go to the toilet if you have long legs. No room in bath room. No blankets. Did I mention bad communication. Super inconsiderate guests who speak on phone at 3am, turn lights on, play music. Bellhop begrudgingly helped us with our bags.

2019,Good location but put in disabled room for some reason and the smell is very average. Musty dirty smell and very noisy. Won’t return.. car park secure and convenient but I can’t find any more positives than that.,2
2020,Dirty room. Bad service. Bad management. valet parking is $65/day. Self parking is far from hotel. They don't care about you at all. the breakfast line is long and you lucky to get clean table. Stay away from this hotel.,1
2021,"Hotel is ideally located. You can go to Sorbonne university or Notre Dame etc. by foot. Breakfast is good, though it might be a little expensive (16€). The rooms are quite small but very tidy and clean. When you are tall, the bed length might be a challenge. You have to sleep diagonally. ",5
2022,"I stayed at the Porto Santa Maria Hotel for two nights in June.  The hotel itself is very nice and modern and in a great location in Funchal.  However, the shower/tub in the very nice bathroom was extremely slippery and i fell in the tub. The combination bathtub/shower had no bathmat or any kind of non-slip surface.  I travel a lot and have never experienced such a slippery surface and have also never fallen in the shower in a hotel before.  While i injured myself I was also lucky that i didn't break my neck.  I'm fairly young but a lot of older guests stay in the hotel and i think this could be a real hazard for some guests.    I filed a report with the hotel and spoke with the manager about this, but she didn't seem overly concerned.  Additionally, i have since wrote the hotel…",3
2023,Highly recommended. Great staff and the room met our expectations in every respect. We upgraded to a deluxe room with a balcony which was a nice touch Decor is very tasteful throughout the hotel and the room was very clean and comfortable. Located on a quiet little dead end alley within a short distance to all this wonderful  neighborhood has to offer. No disappoints. ,5
2024,"All employees are polite, hotel is clean, breakfast is good. Only drawback - rooms are small. Location is also good - metro and bus stations are located in few minutes walk distance. Combined with relatively short distance from the airport (20-30 min with taxi depending on traffic) - it's a good place for a short stay. ",4
2025,"It's an OK hotel with a good location but the service is poor and they are unbelievably cheap. After 2 nights I stopped getting new shower gel and shampoo, and then my favorite was when I ordered something to the hotel and Le Meridien charged me $5 to receive it - can you imagine that? They just want to make money out of everything and the feeling is horrible.  Unsurprisingly they appear to have a union issue and you'll probably be woken up one morning by the protesters.  Unless Le Meridien's location is essential, I recommend you avoid it.",1
2026,"I think the hotel is a bit dated in every aspect.  I knew I was only going to arrive very late and leave early SHI did not stay in the hotel I usually stay, which is a 5 star in most measurable areas. On the other hand starting prices are typically around 350$ with a high ceiling for the best rooms.  The Regent did not disappoint at all if you can get the room at a low rate. The location is good, my room faced a side street, therefore it was quiet, and that was all I needed for a <8 hour stay in a tier one international city.   Service polite and professional, no BS chitchat, also no real friendliness.",4
2027,"Lobby was slippery also wet . No psrking spots even when we paid for parking . Very dissapointed. If parking would have been free i would have maybe understand...room was average, nice view , tv radio stations were not working properly , bad instant coffee..clean bathroom. Average bed and sleeoing quality.",2
2028,"So happy that we stumbled across this hotel when planning our Parisian vacation!  A tiny little boutique hotel, it has tons of charm and is conveniently located near the Eiffel Tower.  The staff was friendly and very helpful, calling taxis, providing directions and also recommendations on local restaurants.  The breakfast was delightful!  Of course, croissant and baguette (made fresh at the local market that morning), jams, fresh and dried fruit, yogurt, granola, plus your choice of coffee, tea, hot chocolate and fresh squeezed juices from the local market.  I would recommend the Hotel Londres du Eiffel to everyone and would most definitely stay there again!",5

2031,"New building across the Tiergarten S-bahn station, two stops from the Hauptbahof, walking distance to ZOO metro stops. Rooms spacious and comfortable, stayed on the sixth floor. Staff efficient and friendly. The only glitch in my room was a separate toillet with no facility to wash hands, otherwise a very comfortable stay.",4
2032,"Rooms are small and not all too well kept (though clean), and there was noise from the pipes in the bathroom through the night. Staff was friendly but not overly efficient. Nothing disastrous but just slightly below what you would expect. The biggest issue was the noise from the pipes; I was happy to have my earplugs. This might not be true for all rooms, but the slightly below average impression remains.",2
2033,"This place is a complete dump. Low End hotel. Stayed two nights, never got room service. The smoke alarm beeped at night and needed to get replaced. There is no hot water. The A/C thermostat doesn’t function correctly. The windows of my room were filthy. Nobody answers the phone at the front desk. The outdoor couches are dirty. Most of the functions on the TV don’t work like the “guest services” option. I complained about my room being cleaned at night and they said no one was available to clean it and they didn’t offer me anything for the inconvenience. I could’ve stayed at a motel 6 and got better service. Never again, don’t stay here. Can’t wait to get out of this place.",1
2034,"Old, tired room, desperately needs a revamp and some life breathing into the place. Pointless internet. Staff are less than helpful inexperienced and aloof. Air con doesn’t function. Waste of time asking for anything zero interest. Checking in takes forever.",2
2035,Hotel is in Poblenou area of Barcelona which is a 10 minute ride on the metro from the centre of Barcelona.  It is then a 5 minute walk from the metro station.  Extremely convenient for visiting everything Barcelona has to offer but in a peaceful location.  Room was smaller than I expected and perhaps needed a little attention (bathroom door broken) but very large comfortable bed with fabulous views out to the sea. Breakfast was good and relatively quiet for the size of the hotel.  Hotel has 28 floors and 4 lifts but for the duration  of our stay only 2 lifts were working so spent a lot of time waiting.  Have stayed in other 5* Melia hotels in Spain and found this one lacking in comparison.  That said staff were extremely friendly and helpful.,4
2036,"Stayed here for my birthday in August, such a fabulous, quirky hotel, just what I love!  The room was just the right size, the bed was amazingly comfortable and huge and loved that it had a little kitchenette to make hot drinks after a long day of sightseeing.  Despite the fact that there is a 6 lane road right next to it, you couldn't hear the traffic at all, it's so well soundproofed.  Don't let it put you off, you really can't hear anything (apart from sirens, but who can't?)   Loved the reception area with the archaeological area, so well thought out to show it off to its full potential.  Can't recommend this hotel highly enough.",5
2037,"This place was cheaper than others along China Beach and was recommended to us as a place to relax for a few days. I took the bait thinking we had been traveling for two weeks and could use some down time.   This is not a place to relax. The entire resort is old and outdated. We stayed in an ocean view room in the main building. You can hear the comings and goings of your neighbors remarkably well. No balcony, view is the construction, and the bed is more of a cot with a 4-inch mattress. There is construction throughout the day, including by the pool area.  They should probably just renovate the existing buildings before building new ones.   The resort is a good 10 min drive from Da Nang city and 20 min from Hoi An. There is really nothing in the area- no other restaurants,…",2
2038,"The Peninsula made an excellent impression from the second we arrived. The hotel manager was in the lobby to greet us which was a very nice and personal touch.  After the warm welcome, we had Flora Bozec in Guest Relations check us in and show us to our rooms.  Flora is one of the most helpful and lovely staff members we have ever met on our travels.  She made sure we were well taken care of throughout our stay.  The staff in the gym/spa also made a fantastic impression.  Very helpful and lovely.  Our rooms were very nice and spacious.  Housekeeping did a beautiful job.  The breakfast was absolutely delicious and very fresh.  The staff at breakfast was another example of the superior service at the hotel.  I must also mention the fantastic concierge team.  They were so helpful…",5
2039,There are always many people there...it's nice place to visit Rooms are quite clean and you have decent breakfast by the way  It's also close to underground and the other transport  So I reccomend this place,4
2040,"Our overall satisfaction with the hotel is high. The quality and equipments of the room was great as well as the comfort and cleanliness. Despite of it, what we appreciated the most was the localisation that is simply perfect. Breakfast and the bar are good enough",5

2042,"Good location in Lido. Pleanty of good(!) restaurants near by for lunch and dinner.  Near bus stops so its easy to visit other places.   Friendly staff. Good breakfast. But not quite the 4 star hotel according to my expectations. Could do with a renovation/ some upgrades.   But since i prefer a good location i found the hotel to be just fine. We  spent our days doing activities outside the hotel area.   It is situated on a hill, as pleanty of other places are as well, so expect to do some ”hill climbing”. Its a very steep road to the lobby from the ”above” street. Easier to walk down to the ”below” street through the pool area. ",3

They put me into the most farthest away, literally, the most farthest! I would mention the room number so you could avoid but totally forget which room was in. However, they refuse to pick me up with their available golf carts because it's a hotel rule. Breakfast is average. Room is decent size. The most disappointed thing is staff performance: inattentive, low performance. There are many of them but standing around and don't know what to do. Rubbish was laying at the lawn and on the beach but they don't bother to clean up. Food was finished during breakfast but without top up unless you ask twice. I think the hotel is run by a…",2

2047,We needed rooms for family for a funeral so needless to say it was disappointing that we needed to keep calling for items .also that bathroom and kitchen are an wasn't cleaned and disinfected. For the price of rooms service didn't match the prices.,2
2048,This hostel is centrally located and just a quick boat ride away from Centraal station...Amsterdam is small so walking or biking is the norm so if you're willing to account for an extra 5 minutes to get to your final destination everyday the location is worth it.  The shower is literally a water closet. There's no distinction between where the shower begins and the bathroom ends the entire room fills with water. I stayed in a room for 4 and it was a tight fit. Definitely a good place for a quick stay and small packers....  Food was meh...i just grabbed fresh fruit everyday. Also the room was so cold and the temperature was difficult to adjust.,3
2049,The hotel is pretty clean and the staff was helpful. Only stayed one night so not too much detail. A little far from the city center where most the activities are. Value for money is pretty good and there is a little shopping area nearby.               ,3

Everything we needed, tea making, comfortable clean bed, Great location for the Metro, tv, good shower, toiletries. Staff very helpful & friendly. Would definitely recommend or stay again when in Paris. Thank you, we loved every minute of our stay and seeing the sights of Paris.",5
2051,"After a horrendous attempt at booking a room online, which spanned two days and a formal complaint about the dishonesty of their staff member, we received a complementary upgrade at the price agreed for a standard room. We really shouldnt have bothered...the upgraded room's design has the two arm chairs positioned so you face the bathroom wirh no room to move them towards the TV. Bath robes and linen have seen better days too. Crown...you are losing your market advantage.  And to make things worst...they OVERCHARGED for the room...I really can't be bothered complaining (or even attempting to get a refund)...AGAIN. Simply not coming back. Im glad I didn't pay full rates for the upgraded room!",2
2052,"When we had a personal difficulty in Paris, the staff went out of their way to help, even loaning us a phone for international calls. The hotel is in a location convenient to Metro. Uber service is also possible. Breakfast is available, at an additional charge of 9 Euros per person, per day. Breakfast included a boiled egg, yogurt, bread, croissant, juice, coffee or tea, cereal, fruit cup, assorted mini cakes, served individually in a small dining area. The hotel has an elevator. The room was not large by American standards, but the bed was queen size and comfortable. All areas are very clean. There is a kettle in the room. We appreciated our stay very much.",5

Club floors still just as out dated as the others... bathrooms tiny and not able to even have two people in them.. No hot water through the evening.  Hotel Is in great need of a massive renovation.  If your a regular IHG member you will not be pleased.  Other than a convenient location  this is not a great choice.  ",2

2056,I was beat over the head with a wine bottle by a drunk stranger in the hotel lobby. I immediately reported this to staff & they told me I was playing a game & lying.  They would not believe the witnesses who observed this incident either. I could have suffered devastating brain & head trauma. Be careful not to risk your life just for a cheaper hotel with reduced rates. This experience could have been fatal & I feel traumatized & unsafe due to my experience.,1
2057,Windowless room. Stained bed linens and towels. Needed to ask for toilet paper. Internet service intermittent at best. Carpet needed vacuuming. Staff was friendly but unreliable--two times cars were promised for pick up at airport but then never showed up. Narrow winding stairs up to all floors--no elevator. Front desk night and early morning staff spoke no English. Breakfast coffee was undrinkable and breakfast buffet--except for fruit and corn flakes--was not tasty. Hotel interior is definitely funky with tango murals painted on almost all walls and (rather garish) Victorian furniture scattered around.,2

I asked for my car to be presented. Thirty minutes later the car shows up. It smelled as though that the car had been driven with the emergency brake on. I asked the valet to show me how he drove my car. He agrees to and then demonstrated having a problem getting it into first gear. I asked him to stop trying and I go inside to wait for the manager.   The next day, I'm checking out and my car is returned. The smell is overwhelming again, but I expected that. My clutch no longer works. They’ve returned to me a car without a working clutch, and dropped it off in the middle of downtown Chicago. I actually…",1

The 1 star review reflects the 2 messages I left for the hotel manager to call me. Unfortunately I returned home with bed bugs from my overnight stay there. While I understand it may be common for the area, the lack of response is not acceptable. How many others have stayed in the room since our departure? I'm very disappointed in the management of this hotel.",1
2060,"My family and I stayed at the Hotel Otto in December 2015. What a fantastic experience - a great location, just a short stroll to the city centre and surrounded by fabulous restaurants. The staff were very welcoming, providing excellent service and having a wonderful knowledge of attractions and things to do. Our studio apartment easily accommodated 4 adults and had all the amenities we required for a comfortable and relaxing stay. The Hotel Otto is to be commended for their Green Practices. We would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Berlin.",4

The furniture was all damaged and it was small.  All this after a three hour wait for the room to be serviced and a promise that it was one of their ""most beautiful"" rooms.  At least the view was nice.  We don't mind paying for quality and good service, but we didn't get it at the Raleigh.  We ate in the restaurant at night, the food was over priced and of average quality; $350 for three of us!  On checking out, it took nearly thirty minutes for our car to be brought around and then the porter broke the handle on one of our suitcases - I saw him do it, but he denied all knowledge.  AVOID!!",1

Cons: we had a 3 bedroom “grande suite”. Not so grand.  Minimal furnishings, beds not so comfortable and the worst part, our sheets were not changed in 5 nights.  Slept in sandy sheets.  Housekeeping was mediocre at best.  Breakfast lines were horrendous and it was chaos every morning.  Layout of the space was poor and the flow didn’t work so you were constantly bumping into people.

Feeling very frustrated as I came from San Francisco Hilton Union Square and was also given a room with a roof view. The girl at the front desk from Hilton Chicago told me there are 1500 rooms in the hotel and they were not running full house.

Also highlighted the locality for food and shopping. As I make it a habit to do morning runs while on overseas travels, she also provided some suggested routes and ideas.

Upon checking in we booked a family room with two double beds for myself my wife and our 21-year-old daughter, the beds were so small that both my wife and I after a long exhausting flight from London had virtually no sleep. The following day we decided to speak to the front desk and complain, they were very unhelpful and in different saying all the rooms are the same, so we decided to have to pay to upgrade our room to a junior suite for an extra $60 a night plus taxes.

Room was not too big even though it is a superior one, but for 2 people pretty enough. The decoration and lights in the room were appropriate to the style of the hotel and created the atmosphere of romantic Paris. The cleaning service is very good also. The only small recomendation: what the rooms need is maintenance as there are some scratches son the carpet, walls and furniture. By the way, the breakfast in the hotel is very good and complete. The price/quality is fine comparing to the cafes around the area.  All in all, the hotel is a great option for some days in Paris with your couple. P.S. Gummy sharks on the reception…",5

2070,"This Embassy Suites is very close to the Magnificent Mile and Chicago's best downtown attractions but there is nothing good to say about the hotel. My sisters and I reserved a room 30 days prior to arrival.  During check-in we waited at least 10 minutes just to be acknowledged by the front desk.  Then we finally received the most cold and unfriendly assistance from the reservationist. We softly asked if everything was ok with our reservations and abruptly told that we didn't have reservations and we would be lucky to get a room.  We were eventually assigned to room 911. When we opened the door a very stale odor (perhaps mold) punched us in the face; the furniture was dull, old and worn; closet space outdated; the view outside the window were the grills and bumpers of cars in a…",1

Breakfast was extra, but a bargain: buffet included fresh fruit, juices, croissants, pastries, ham, cheese, etc.  Beds had a single puffy layer in place of a top sheet + blanket - OK when room is AC cold, but when I got warm I did not have option of just a sheet.  But manager tried to rip us off as he checked us in.  After he checked our passports, he asked if we'd like to pay with the same credit card I made reservation with.  I said yes and gave him card.  He said numbers did not match.  I asked to see the bill, and he showed me a stapled stack of small credit card machine receipts and 8 x 11 print outs,…",3

From our first night we had problems, We arrived on my birthday (22nd Aug) tired and decided to order room service. 2 meals came, one was the wrong order. Hungry, my girlfriend ate and I had to wait for mine so we ate at separate times. I accepted as genuine mistake. The following day I was in the room and noticed a trail of ants around our toilet, going back into our room. When I pulled out our desk there was a colony of ants and it was extremely dirty (in pics). It took 3 calls to reception to get somebody up. It got cleaned I complained downstairs and we were offered a room on a lower floor after paying extra money for a room on a…",2
2074,"Ba na hills - Cable car ride up was amazing, close to 30 mins long and offered spectacular views! But the hills on its own were only average in my opinion. I came on a Monday and left on Wednesday but the place was hoarded with tourists throughout. Very limited attractions to visit, only one French village and French gardens with a pagoda. The French village were made up of faux buildings which took us less than 30 mins to finish exploring. In all, I would say half a day to be more than sufficient for the trip to ba na hills. We spent 2 days and 2 nights and were extremely bored on the second day. There were many stairs between places, which made it extremely painful for my elderly grandma whom I was traveling with.

I wish I hadn't. The location may be ok but as are a lot of other hotels. My room was old, tiny and noisy. On reporting this the Guy on reception Kirby was the rudest person working within a hotel I have ever dealt with and I stay in a lot of hotels. He was arrogant, cheeky and sarcastic. He should not be on this type of customer facing role. Coming from the Marriott where I stayed the previous few days and arriving here was like another world. I ended up checking out as Kirby could no accommodate a room move. He said there was no one to clean the room I had already checked into. Despite me…",1

2077,My bride of 40 years and I had the best experience at Hotel Passy Eiffel. The staff was very welcoming and friendly. Their English was much better than our French which was a real blessing. The room was overlooking Rue de Passy and we could see the Eiffel Tower from our windows. Once the windows were closed the noise from the street disappeared. The room was very quiet at night. A small fridge in the room was very helpful in keeping some munchies cold. The size of the room was very comfortable. Thank you staff for making our 40th anniversary a great one. ,5
2078,"Mystique Hotel in Santorini was NOT up to the standard of the other hotels and I would NOT recommend it for the following reasons:  1. The front office staff is unfriendly and incompetent.  On several occasions they said a taxi was waiting up on the street and we should go meet it.  When we got to the top of the many steps, we had to either wait 20 min for it to arrive or hail our own taxi. I also asked them to check us in for our upcoming flight, with 1 luggage for each person, and print our boarding passes.  At the airport, I was told we had no luggage checked and would have to pay 30 Euro PER BAG ( instead of 17 Euro per bag) as a penalty.  2.

Our room was large and quite but the shower was very poor as was the TV, we bought a travel kettle  with us as we knew they went not provided. The breakfast room is very small and a couple of times we had to have our food outside, the continental breakfast is mediocre and if you want a cooked breakfast of scrambled eggs and bacon it costs 2.5 euro extra. The location is very good as long as you don't mind walking up the steep hills  from the main road and we found the bus service into Funchal very good and we had the option of using the numbers 1, 2 and 4 plus the Aerobus.

The breakfast wasn't to my taste and the food that should have been hot was stone cold so did not eat the breakfast which was included in the price.  The room was very basic which for what we paid we couldn't expect a palace. The room was cleaned daily and fresh towels provided. The staff were very friendly and helpful I couldn't fault them in anyway.  Unfortunately the quality of sleep was very poor. The rooms were not in the least bit sound proof and could literally hear everything (including upstairs guests using the toilet) We also had a cupboard right…,3

The check-in staff were very helpful and polite and the ground floor reception area is very attractive.  My request for a thinner duvet was dealt with immediately.  The rooms are spacious, but fairly simply furnished. Bathroom is nice - toiletries are provided, but no hair conditioner.  The soundproofing is extremely efficient so if like us, you like peace and quiet, I would recommend this hotel, as it so quiet considering it is in central Berlin.  We didn't eat at the hotel as we like to go out and explore the local restaurants when we're travelling, but the menu did look nice.  We were slightly put off by the cost of the breakfasts…",4

We also requested towels. Did not receive the first night. Numerous calls on the second day finally got us towels. We had none in the room. The smell was  awful. We also. Oiled smell urine coming from the bathroom. Very very unpleasant experience and non responsive staff.  I definitely do not recommend.,2

There are a few negatives thou... no hand-shower in the toilet for the ladies, no room to place your luggage when you want to open it, or any other space or level where to put your things other than on to the floor. The shower/sink are is a bit of a mess, after the shower you need move the floor towel back and forth on the step if you don't want wash your hands etc on a wet floor. The overall carpet they have on the floor are very, very dirty in pretty much all the rooms.

The kitchen was integrated in the room absolutelly gracefully. All the appliances were up-to-date. I think that opportunity to hide the bed and turn your bedroom to the living room is a very smart solution.

The bed is actually connected to the shower so I would not recommend staying here with anyone other than family members who are used to seeing you without clothing. Zero privacy. It was quite difficult to maneuver around the room having two suitcases so it was a struggle. It was $95 per night so I didn’t expect much from it and I was correct in my assumption. On a positive note it is directly across from the train station so it was convenient. The burger restaurant around the corner was also quite good.",4

The Wifi access is disgraceful, even for those who pay. Staff are very nice but management seems entirely absent. Needs a complete refurbish before it is fit for purpose. Also you will probably need to get your key reprogrammed at least once if you are staying more than one night. Reception is often closed for hours at a time, with a sign saying that the staff need to rest (i.e we are too cheap to hire more staff so we will put up this obnoxious sign instead.

The wi-fi internet is free and fast. The breakfast is just OK. The personnel is very helpful. One of the cons - the temperature in the room cannot be set above 21C.

The rooms were also very small for 4 people, there was no shelf to put any things on, only small lockers at the end of the bed which wasn't ideal for us. The pillows were also long and narrow which made our sleep uncomfortable, and the thin walls made everything too easy to hear so we didn't sleep well at all during out stay. However, the hostel was very clean and the reception and bar area was lovely and modern. Perfect if you are only there for a couple of days and are budgeting. ",3
2128,"Really pleasant experience  Staff r very helpful Rooms are very clean, modern Well appointed Only negative would be is that it’s hard to control temp so nite room temps can get very cold 6th flor terrace is very pleasant  Great sangria  Small small pool but that’s to be expected Overall I would highly recommend this hotel since location is great to get around and service is wonderful ",4
2129,"I ahd high expectations, based on previous reviews, but was really disappointed.  The hotel may ahve been good some 20 years ago, but is in dire need of a refurbishment.  Even though I was upgraded to a huge corner suite, it still felt depressing.  The pool are, and its staff, was a joke - two large jacuzzis are kept only half-filled, in other words, unusable (as the jets are above the water level), the staff don't speak a word of English / French / any other foreign language (seriously), and are clueless.  Very, very disappointing.",2
2130,Stayed at the Colonial hotel for a weekend in October 2018. I will certainly stay there again when I go to Barcelona. The staff were ultra friendly and helpful. The hotel is spotless and in a wonderful location. ,4
2131,"Beware of unauthorized charges on your credit card!!!  Booked a room for my boyfriend using my card.  He paid cash when he got to the hostel.  They still charged my card multiple times and when I called them to explain and get a refund they couldn't keep their story straight about why my card was charged multiple times, let alone at all since the balance was paid in cash.  They created scenarios about what ""might have happened"" to explain the confusion on their end.  I laid out clearly what actually happened, and they conceded that they would refund the charges, BUT NEVER DID and stopped communication with me.  After a week had to contact my bank to have the charges reversed.",1
2132,"After staying here three days, the second day my head started to itch and when we got home later that week we all found out that we had gotten head lice. Awesome. :| There was also terrible terrible service especially in the downstairs breakfast restaurant. We waited 20 minutes or more to get our orders taken. Waiter even confronted us about our ""complaint"". It was stupid. ",1

2134,"This is my second time in this hotel and I loved it.. just like I did last time.  I have special requirements for my hotel in Berlin because we stay for a long time with the kids. I need a place with a kitchenette, washing machine and dryer, and a swimming pool. Also central with good access to transportation. SANA Berlin is - I think- the one of the only 2 hotels in Berlin that offer that and the only one in west Berlin.  Our room was really nice, but of course small like in all Europe. The appliances are Seimens/Bosch great brands. Coffee machine and kettle in every room, with some pots and pans..etc.  The hotel is chic, modern, very clean and 3 minutes from the underground and a good supermarket. The neighborhood is very good and very safe. There is a also a private entrance…",4
2135,"The Mandala Suites were a nice surprise and retreat from the hustle of the City.  While located in the core of Berlin, the suites took you away from the feeling of being in the middle of a City.  The Balcony offered a place to view the city from.  The kitchenette was a perfect size and well appointed.  ",4
2136,"Dated hotel that smelt funky and had poor security.  It's one street up from the beach.  Many of the competitors on the strip offer better quality for a similar price.   Felt unsafe the whole time, avoid this hotel, there are better options.",2
2137,"This is a 4 star hotel and that should be the minimum you should expect for everything. We like this hotel and in general it is 4 star, but in some areas it fails and due to an unexpected problem we found out that you get different levels of service too. Last year we stayed over Xmas and New Year in a standard room, badic but clean and acceptable with kitchenette including microwave. This year we stayed end of January and asked for a similar room which we got in fact next door to the last one. After a long trip we decided to have a snooze and glass of juice. Waking up a couple of hours later I reached for my glass of juice on the bedside table without switching the light on and had a drink,  the light then when on. To my horror I then saw that the glass was covered in ants and I…",3

Check in/ check out both quick and trouble free. Very friendly, helpful staff on reception. Rooms very clean and spacious.  We had a couple of drinks in the hotel bar every night before bed.  A good range of drinks available served by the amazing barman Danilo. Nothing was too much trouble for him. Each evening, he welcomed us with  friendly conversation and a smile, what a great guy! Everyone should try the 'Sweet and Salty' cocktail, delicious!  Can't comment on the hotel food as we didn't eat in there but we walked past the buffet style breakfast on a couple of occasions and it looked…",4

After our daily breakfast (included in the price for our room) we stepped out right in the heart of this historic area. A short walk to Notre Dame, the Marais and numerous art galleries and museums. Set in a quiet street & with facility for self catering and laundry. We had a wonderful stay. Merci, Roland!",5
2141,"Nice facility - but 1) the rooms are VERY dark - Very poor lighting and 2) the there is  no exercise facility, and 3) the desk staff is VERY inflexible, transaction-oriented, indifferent, bordering between rude and uninterested/apathetic and discourteous. So, they are a nicest facility in Bishop, with the worst staff. The exception is the staff that prepare and serve the breakfast.They are fantastic.",2
2142,I stayed at this hotel per a reservation through my company and extended my stay for ease of not transitioning to another hotel. Friends who stayed at nearby hotels had far better experiences at a lower price. Each room at the Wyndham seemed discombobulated and we even had to switch rooms because I was so dissatisfied with my first. ,1
2143,"Big surprise with this hotel. Expected something different for a brand new hotel.   Totally minimalistic, room was small. Bat was considerable but, even though the window was tinted, no blinds on it so was a wired sensation watching the neighbors while showering. Bath had some of the comforts but no soap. Room was lacking an alarm clock or something to tell the hour. The bed was wide but short. I'm 5'-11"" and my feet where uncomfortably hanging out of the bed, so I slept sideways, way I fit.  BFast was on a Starbucks in the facility so not a good BFast at all.  They tried to do a signature hotel but missed the mark. Front desk service not at par. Mor than a hotel is a room and you figure out the rest.  Not pleased with the sedición of going there. Will not come back.  ",2

When checking in at 10am I was told the room was ready but check in was only at 14h. I was offered a early check in but they would charge an additional $R200!! Seaview rooms also cost an additional R$200... As this was not clear on their website, it feels like a rip off.",2
2147,I do agree with past reviews this hotel is 4 star in parts but the classic rooms are 3 star. Perfectly comfortable but not the luxury I was hoping to find.  I do hope they are going to eventually upgrade the rooms as its such a great location. Its quite far to walk through corridors to the rooms using several lifts and a flight of stairs so make sure you choose your room carefully if your not very mobile. There is also no kettle in the classic rooms so I took my own. I would also suggest replace the plastic balcony furniture with more modern. Plus some big plants would really make a huge difference to the balcony. Such a waste of great space. But on a positive note the Breakfast had a wide choice of food to suit everyone. The bar lounge area was very nice and the dinning room.…,3

I called and was put on hold for over 20 minutes, told to call back (I called durning normal busness hours and was not helped when the desk was supposed to be open), and priovided horrible cusotmer service. Make sure to book online and not need their customer service departments assistance. THEY ARE NO HELP AT ALL!",2

However it is just along the tramline in the middle of two stations. Each can be reached in under 10 minutes depending how fast one walks.  The hotel itself is new and modern. The rooms are spacious and equipped with convenient features. Next to the standard TV, minibar and land-line phone. At the bedside of each bed are two USB outlets to charge mobile phones tablets laptops etc. In case you forgot your charger. Also all the lights can be controlled from an array of switches next to each bed. The room can be entered through two doors.

2151,Very nice hotel within walking distance of a train station. Very quiet neighborhood. They have a really good free breakfast every morning. The building is not air conditioned but has windows that open and provided fans for our room. It appeared to me that very few buildings in Berlin are air conditioned. Staff are friendly as well.,5
2152,"First and foremost the hotel is beautiful and the public areas exhibit a true old world charm. However, we experienced incidents on our stay which really detracted from a 5* experience and the 2* rating reflects a comparison against other five star properties we've stayed at.  We booked a standard room and were allocated a traditional room on second floor (the fourth floor houses more modern rooms). The room was fine, albeit nothing special, but we could clearly hear conversations/the tv from the room above which seemed to come through the open air vents. It was really distracting and not something we wanted to listen to all evening so requested a room change and were given the choice of the same room on another floor or a modern fourth floor room.   We opted for the top floor…",2

Not having any parking is not a thing we were happy with, my son is in the Navy and was transferring stations to Key West and all his important paper work and belongings were in his vehicle and had no idea where it was being taken to with no access to his vehicle!! Then we could barely fit in the elevator with our luggage then could barely get into door to the room, door barely got past bed!! The room smelled terrible like old moldy fabric! Then upon inspecting the bed well let's just say the bedskirt was stained and the blankets weren't even blankets they seemed to be sheets sewn together to make a blanket! Granted…",1
2154,"It is walking distance from a lot of great areas to visit, not far from the castle. But rooms are small and not well thought through. Difficult to store your things and bathtub in the middle of the room was not convenient. Hot water was really slow to get, we had noise from the bathroom due to water or heating, not sure, and the smell was horrible from the bathroom in the morning. Some friends had also some issues in their room with the smell. Bar was great, as well as breakfast, and the service was okeyish ... Spa have to be booked way in advance as it is open to outside the hotel. So better to think booking a long time before arriving.",3

The view overlooking the pool, however, was off-putting: the surrounding apartment buildings were shabby and dirty, laundry hanging out, unkempt junk piled as storage, dogs barking and even a rooster that crowed at all hours of the day and night. But the pool area in the middle of all this was lovely and calm, small with only a few chairs and tables. Our doors that opened up as a Juliet balcony were poorly designed – the chairs had to be moved out of the way to get the doors open and then moved back. In the afternoons, the staff provide small tapas at the reception. There is only 1 bottle of water provided,…",4

It also as a lot of eclectic items to excite you and is nicely decorated. The room we had was well laid out with views of the local area. It's position makes it a good choice for those wanting to explore on foot, by bus or by bike.

I stayed at the Hyatt Regency McCormick Place as a quick in-town getaway as I attended an event at the Arie Crown Theater. The customer service was phenomenal and beyond my expectations, but the relaxing and comfortable accommodations NEEDED and expected were absolutely terrible. Ended up checking out in the middle of the night. All staff was extremely professional and top notch, but the stay was absolutely horrible. Very disappointed!",1

No one ever came to take our order. everyone one else was being served but us, after waiting 25 minutes we decided to leave. It was pretty embarrassing. I won't return for that reason.",1

Good selection of English TV channels to relax with after a busy day in the city.

Breakfast was varied and served by friendly staff.  Not cheap but then again it's Berlin!",4

I spent fives nights at this hotel and would happily return any time.  My room was at the front and had a lovely balcony overlooking the garden - very relaxing.  I only had one breakfast - the continental breakfast.imore than adequate.  My stay was made even more pleasant as my birthday fell during my stay and the hotel gave me a lovely gift of their own brand toileteries.  I can say little more except that you could not find a more pleasant place to stay in Cannes, even at a much higher price.",5

Fortunately, the loo was separate, and private! Perhaps the design would appeal more to the younger generation - but we, and the friends we travelled with, are past our first flush of youth, and would have enjoyed having a little more privacy when bathing!

We also rented bikes and enjoyed that a lot.  the bad: charging $15/day for parking without telling us or having a sign in the parking lot or even asking for our car licence plate (what if we hadn't driven?! we had friends who did not drive - wonder if they were charged for parking as an assumption too?) though I have to say after I complained when returning home they…",2

In the mornings I would head to St Oberholz cafe just down the road for a sandwich and a coffee.

The restaurant had a good breakfast with great staff.  The front desk staff were ok.  Our room was 101 and it was possibly the worst room as it was directly above the main entrance. At nights there is a loud banging noise from the metal doors underneath the window. I did report this to the front desk and the next night they did gently close the door which help.

Just remember to tip the guide at the end as the tours are tip based only! The bar downstairs was also fantastic, the hostel has its own brewery and all of the bartenders were really friendly. Pub quizzes were also held there which were fun too. The breakfast in the cafe was also really good and the coffee was fantastic. Would highly recommend!",4

2189,"We are surprised that no one has commented on the fact that the 'new wing' described in the hotel website (""From the 9 existing rooms, Pousada de Óbidos now has 8 new rooms, integrated into a new wing, with a total of 17 rooms."") is in fact entirely separate from the castle.  It is cobbled together from a couple of unremarkable residential structures, and while the accommodations are adequate they are in no way special and offer nothing of a 'castle experience'.  The website does not provide any exterior images of the 'new wing', which makes it impossible to understand this arrangement when booking.  People staying in these rooms walk uphill to the castle for breakfast, along with many tourists doing the same for sightseeing  For the price (we paid 170 euros for 2, including…",3

Tiny balcony was a nice touch as was the proximity of the bathroom door to said balcony.  Very comfy bed. Pool area was nice to hang out in for a little whike in the AM before starting our day.",4

Hotel's neighborhood not nice. Hotel is located on a hill so you have to climb on steep streets. To Marina about 20 min by foot;to the Old Town- 30 min. The only thing I didn't like is orange light at the reception all day long. There is no natural light here. In summary- average hotel, rather for people who don't look for relax in nature.",3

As most people have already mentioned, the location is in the middle of the jungle, which is nice and peaceful, but a real pain the backside to get anywhere. This is the only positive, if you could call it that!  Reception staff were not that friendly.   My room was on the ground floor and the ceilings are very thin, so I could hear the children running around all evening and first thing in the morning - so not very relaxing at all.

Poor breakfast choice. Slow wifi. ",2

2199,"I was here recently on a business trip.   When my secretary first made the booking for a non-smoking room. When I arrived, I was told by reception that my room is a smoking room but they have cleaned up and aired the room. As I have a sensitive nose, I requested to have my room changed. The receptionist then told me that most of the non-smoking rooms were taken up and that I would also need to pay extra for the non-smoking rooms. In the end, she managed to find a non-smoking room for me.  As I landed in Shanghai rather late, I was looking for food around this hotel area. You will literally not find any restaurants or eating places. There is a small convenient store near the hotel though.  The roads near the hotel are not brightly lit and I do not feel safe when travelling there.…",2
2200,"The only good thing about this hotel is the location. Staff is rude and not willing to help. Every morning we had to ask for towels and the front desk always said they were on the way, but never came. They also charge a $100 a day for a deposit. Parking is 42 a night and there is no other parking available for the guest. After all our trouble we could even get a later check out the next morning. Once again staff was not willing to help. Will never stay here again.",1
2201,The interior decoration of the hotel was minimal and chick. The location is great. It is very close to the river bank.The breakfast is not bad and the coffee was quite good. The wifi connection was good. The room was quite small. It faced the main street and was quite noisy at nights. There are only a few toiletries and no kettle or complimentary water in the room. There are no signs showing where the stairs are and that could be problematic in case of an emergency.,3
2202,"Be wary of the price. The total price when I booked included resort fees, but what I didn't realize is that they only have valet parking ($45 per night) and they charge a $37 per night hospitality fee that you don't find out about until the end. An extra $350 at checkout after i had already paid for the stay up front. Other than that everything else is pretty bland. nothing great and also nothing horribly wrong.",2
2203,"We spent a few days in this hostel and, in general, it was not a good stay. It is ideal for youngsters who are looking for tourism and bash in Rio, not worrying with the hostel they are staying but only looking for a place to spend the night talking and drinking. Strongly do not recommend for solo trips, business or study.  Good points: great breakfast, infrastructure, nice location, lots of plugs in each bed (easy to charge your phone)  Bad points: staff are not polite and friendly, wifi doesn’t work on bedrooms, cleanings happening with people in the badroom, without previous warning, some staff members looks to literally live in the shared bedroom we spent (nonsense!), can’t control air conditioning (it worses because Rio is a very hot city), can’t bring or consume any food or beverages inside hostel, must buy all of them in here or consume outside (totally unnecessary...).  I give 2.5 stars. Sorry. 😣…",2

The mattress in the sofa bed was so worn out that my sisters decided to just throw a sheet on the torn coach and sleep on top of it. The toilet ran all night.. Ice is only available on the fourth floor. The closet was torn off the hinges and almost fell on top of me when I tried to open it. The whirlpool was dirty and out of order. Make sure you view your bill before checking out- they charged me $20 forparking per day and I did not have a car. ",1

When we saw the photos for this hotel my partner and I were so excited, thinking we were treating our selves, we very were wrong!!!  - The rooms were so small you could hardly fit the two of us plus our luggage in there and the place is beyond dated. - the beds were horrible and old and every time room service made them the bottom sheet never covered the entire mattress leaving it exposed to our skin. - the balcony door would not lock and looked to had been tampered with, the staff didn't care once complaining a few times they cut a rod and placed it behind the sliding door to lock it. - the city view is literally looking into someone else's apartment, we saw people getting changed, exercising, cooking, cleaning, you name it!…",2

The Zoo and Aquarium are close by, as is the Kaiser-Wilhelm Memorial  'broken church'  and Bikini Berlin. The service in the hotel was good, the concierge a bit surly and the bed a bit firm for my liking....but I still recommend this international hotel. The spa experience (no extra charge) was a wonderful extra at the end of a long day of touring. This was the best breakfast buffet ever! Selections for all travelers included full American, Asian and classic European options. ",4

I felt I was paying too high of a rate for a hotel in such a outdated condition, where there are other choices closer to the city center and at a better value for money. The room has several old wall sockets, while the iron provided in the room is not compatible with them. The butler was nice enough to provide an adaptor after I asked for it.",2

First of all, the staff was so rude and should NOT be working in any type of customer service what-so-ever! Second of all, the rooms were filthy and looked very unsanitary. Our rooms reeked of smoke, the bathroom was so disgusting, dirty toilets, sink, floor and shower! The bedding made us all itch and we had a rash from it the next day. There is nothing clean, comfortable or accomadating about this place. Save your money and go somewhere else!!",1

Also, it is noisy: you could hear everything on the room next door, especially the bathroom. Breakfast was very busy during low season and the selections were disappointing for a hotel this style. Very basic and plain buffet.  The views are great (ocean view rooms) and it really is not that far from the city center (app. 5 min drive) plus there is a beach across the street. It seems like a hotel very suitable for families and the pools were nice too.  The staff was a major pro: everyone was friendly and attentive. It just wasn't our style of hotel.",3

Subway is within 3 minute waking distance. ",4

2218,well. we have stayed at many Intercontinental hotels and this one stunk. we stayed here 2 times in thr past and were put in a beautiful room with a separate bath and shower...this time we were on the 15th floor with so many problems we cut our trip short! The beds are a nightmare...VERY lumpy and lopsided they were visably crooked :/ The bathroom was very tiny compared to the other room we had in the past. The $90 room service meal was so awful that we would have been better ordering a pizza! the valet parking attendant was so rude that i honestly worried about our car...for $62 dollars a day charge for parking would service with a smile be too much to ask? There are so many other choices of worthy hotels in san francisco...do not waste your money here,1

I had to go to the desk downstairs several times to ask for hand soap, body soap and shampoo. 4) The glass in the bathroom had rust and a lot of black stains.  5) The air conditioner was extremely loud and woke me up every night.  6) There were several stains on the bed sheets.",1

It's a great hotel, lovely clean and comfortable rooms, the pool is great; warm and clean, the staff are wonderful and approachable however.. The pool bar was closed down, so there was no option of food all afternoon apart from the snack bar and I just had the worst hotel meal I've ever had. There's no room service at the hotel, so I went down and ordered a meal, had to juggle the tray, drink and cutlery myself up to the room (what kind of hotel doesn't have room service?!) and I just ate what I can only describe as a findus lasagne and Mcain microwaveable chips, remember the ones in the box from the 90's.. yep I suspect ive just eaten those and they've possibly…",2

Very nice hotel, excellent views, centric to gothic area and nice staff. Would stay again but the beds made stay tiring.  ",4
2224,On the website it’s written the hotel offer parking which was main reason we chose that hotel but when we arrived it occurred to be actually full and we had to pay 20€ for a night on the nearest parking. 20€ is not the cheapest parking. We could have a better room for that price then.,2

I know that Double Tree is better than this because I have been in many  Double Tree hotels. My seven son asked if we can bring our carpet cleaner next time to help them. My children had their socks on and it looked muddy afterwards. My regret is that I trusted you and prepaid and so I can't get my refund and go to a different hotel. Some allergy medicine, Flonase, nasal spray, and lots of regrets-I will wait till Friday to check into the Hyatt(hopefully a better experience)",1

2227,"Great location, right on the river. Really good breakfast, lots of options. However, very disappointed with level of service, for example the booklet in the room says the rooms are cleaned twice a day. Our room was only turned down once in a 4 day stay and one day wasn’t cleaned at all. This was raised to reception who tried to think of a reason for this and then simply apologised.",3

Location is perfect and restaurants, bars and shopping all on your doorstep. The hotel has a 24 H bar if you need it also rooms lovely and clean . The room I stayed in had underfloor heating in the bathroom and a speaker for music also beds lovely and comfy . Staff were welcoming and friendly.

The breakfast is good to the price. ",4

On the road side, it is much quieter, however, the rooms are much darker and the room lighting isn't very bright. The large window between the bathroom and the bedroom can be a pain. Even with the blind closed, a visit to the WC at night will illuminate the entire bedroom. The corridor is heavily tufted carpet- so not easy to wheel heavy luggage down-especially as the lift and stairs are at one end of a very long corridor.

I left my suitcase and laptop computer at Reception for five hours whilst I went into town.  I collected it in the evening and, when I returned home, found that it had been dropped from a height resulting in a smashed screen and bent case.  No-one mentioned this to me when I collected it.

This hotel is in the old town so we expected some noise and chatter at night. However... the hotel is opposite a bar (note, a street level bar, not a basement nightclub) that has a DJ on Fridays and Saturdays playing thumping music until 3am. In a room down the side of the hotel it's an annoyance e.g. you can't open the window. In a room at the front it's like being in a tent at a festival. While not the hotel's fault it was a big downside to our stay.",2

The debacle continued as we found that the shower and sink didn't drain properly and the shower itself was broken wasting a huge amount of water.  The AC takes 20 minutes to engage (per their engineer), the in room coffee maker was also broken.  We presented to the desk in the morning to request another room.

As others have mentioned rooms can be small--mine was--but this is all part of the charm. I had a room overlooking the street with a small balcony. I enjoyed sitting, watching and reading with the in-room coffee maker! The air conditioning was much needed and worked well. Nice to have bathrobe and great toiletries.

Similar locations and facilities in other comparable cities will cost much more.",5
2243,DISAPPOINTED!  My daughter scraped her elbow on a nail from the couch.  The upside is the hotel brought her band aids and had maintenance come and cut down the nails in the broken couch.  The view is amazing but the hotel workers are on strike.  They are shouting and loud as you walk in.  There is no room service.  The pool says closed for ‘annual maintenance’.   We booked this hotel specifically because it has a pool and it’s close to Navy Pier.  My daughter is very disappointed and so am I.   This stay cost us over $800.     I could have booked a cheaper hotel with a working pool.   This is not how I wanted to celebrate my birthday.,1

The room was large for Paris but the only negative thing I could say is that there were not any drawers to put our clothes in, we basically lived out of our suitcases. As for the Metro, the closest one was Montparnessee but that is a 14 minute walk as you are going through their commuter rail system to get to the Metro, there is another Metro fairly close as well.  Not much to see in the area but we really didn't hang out in the area so much so that was okay.",5

Advise that luggage be brought out to the front desk by yourselves during check out  as all the bell boys are engaged during the peak period.

On arrival we checked in and left our bags went straight into Amsterdam to check out the sights. We decided to go back to the hotel for around 7 to see our rooms and get some food. The quality of the food in the bar was very poor the bar man was even more miserable than the bar menu..... Also no alcohol served in the hotel so the hotel has some pros and cons  The tram stop is right outside  The bathroom was amazing in the room shower was bliss after a long day walking all around the sights and attractions. Coffee machine in the room was great to have that then head off in search of breakfast. I would not stay here again because the no alcohol there is no…,3
2257,"This hotel was prominently featured on the cover page of the 2018 IHG annual report - I believe the IHG management was really proud of this hotel, but I hope that they would stay in this hotel to experience the subpar service. I will share three stories during my 4-night stay in April 2019:  1) On my day of arrival, I went to a restaurant called Mr. Fisher to make a dinner reservation. Before I got into the restaurant entrance, a staff member stopped me and asked if I had a reservation. He said that the restaurant was fully booked for that night. I asked if there's any opening for the following night - no again. How about the 3rd night? He said I had to go in to speak to the staff.  When I went inside to talk to the staff, they said they had a table for me on that night at 8pm.…",2
2258,"Me and my Mum stayed at this hotel for 2 nights on holiday. On arrival we left our bags as we were before the room was ready and on return our bags were put into our room and coats hung up in the wardrobe which was great. The hotel room was a great size, bathroom where toilet is a little small but great room and the beds so comfy. We were able to add breakfast on the morning if we wanted when we woke up and the staff were really friendly. As we didn't know Paris very well the reception member got the map and identified all the main tourist attractions, the two metro stations which the hotel is between and also gave us some great restaurants to visit which helped up a lot throughout the few days we stayed. Would highly recommend staying here!",5
2259,"The location is important when you spend a weekend in a major city. This hotel has perfect connections with Tegel airport, just a quick bustour. It is located next to the fine shopping on Kurfurstendamm and has major U-ban etc close by. The hotel might not have the charm but it is clean and everything works fine. The breakfast isn't cheap, but it is very nice.",4
2260,"Just checked out of here this morning after a 3 night stay. I was excited by the photos of the hotel. Front desk and valet were excellent, however upon arriving at our room I was so disappointed! The paint work especially was desperately needing redone and woodwork replaced. The corners of the window sills were filthy as were the windows on the outside. The fridge was full of mound as my photo shows. The furniture was a mix match of pieces which were permanently marked. We never used them at all. The bathroom floor and tiles were black in some areas. The sink taps were awful with green mould and black scum. On the first day I had to ask for a new blanket as the one on the bed was previously marked, this was changed no problem. The hotel staff from the restaurant below…",1
2261,"Worst stay ever. No bathroom in the room, the hallway smelled so bad, toilet is even smaller than public toilet, and far from our room. Noisy environment. Can hear ladies screaming and door banging on weekday all the way till 3-4am. But the worst part is, we felt itch all over our body. I bet the sheets ain't clean at all. Definitely not worth your stay. I rather be sleeping in the car. ",1
2262,New and modern hotel. I got an upgrade to a suit for free.  U-bahn is on 100m.  perfect breakfast with many specific food. The hotel thought on everything that a traveler would need and could forget. The fitness room was very modern with a modern tools.,5

I was only right about the latter....it's a LONG public bus ride to down, about 40 minutes. At least the stop is on the road just above the hotel and it costs only 3.10 euros to get to Funchal. There is no airport shuttle although the planes taking off and landing will blast over the hotel all day long, and that's unusual. The taxi will run anywhere from 8-10 euros depending on your baggage, traffic flow, etc. The good points about the hotel are the breakfast and dinner buffets, which are delicious, well-executed, and filling. Eateries near the hotel cost about the same as eating on the premises, so…",3
2265,"This is a real cracker of a hotel. The location is excellent, directly beside the u-bahn, surrounded by coffee shops and little places to eat as well as places to buy carryouts or (drink in the room) wine. It's also within walking distance of Alexanderplatz. The hotel itself is friendly and quirky. Staff are eager to help but don't intrude and it feels very laid back. There's a little rooftop terrace  and a covered courtyard. You can relax in the coffee shop/ bar bit and they have copies of The Guardian to read or lots of books. There's a lift if you need to use one. Breakfast is nine euros each if you are a resident and we highly recommend it. We ate so much each day we didn't need to eat again until dinner, except for coffee/ sticky bun stops. Breakfast is a help yourself…",5

The building fascade is uninspiring. Once you get past the several pieces of beautiful furniture in the rooms the beds are not comfortable and the breakfast is very average. The lobby is nicely appointed and for the whopping 300.00 plus per night its overpriced and expensive for what it is.  We also noticed that the rates went up to over 1k per night and had to leave the hotel after one night because nobody in their right mind would spend this amount of money per night on a place such as this.  Grossly overpriced.   This is a 3.5-4 star hotel only...it is nothing near a 5 start hotel imo. Nothing luxurious about…,3

Front desk staff, Mary, was rude, cold, and unwelcoming. However, another Front desk staff, Cesar, was very nice, polite, and understanding.   Bell service staffs, Obed (who also valeted my car) and the other slim gentleman with long beard (sorry I didn't ask for his name) were very nice and helpful.   We had to evacuate ourselves, moving to another hotel within six hours of checking-in, in the middle of the night, due to bad and intolerable paint and thinner smell from the ongoing renovation work, of which we were NOT AT ALL informed upon checking in. I was very worried about our health, especially I had my dogs with me.…",1
2272,"The hotel needs to do a lot of work.  The locations and the views on this gorgeous island are superb.  First they put us in inferior rooms in a second nearby location. That location has only about ten chaises around the pool.  Totally inadequate.  Then the hotel graciously moved us (always a hassle).  The primary place is better but something is missing.  The room decor is ordinary, not first-class at all.  They need a top interior designer.  The staff is helpful, good recommendations.  It's the physical plant that is lacking.",3
2273,"The room was nice, the staff was nice and helpful, the location is good but: 1) The shower cabin is built completely wrong and every time we took a shower the whole bathroom would flood. After asking we got an extra floor towel but working 10 minutes to dry the bathroom floor, every time, is something I don't want to do on my vacation... 2) It was an extremely hot weekend and there is no a/c or fan in the room. It was good for drying those soaking wet towels that we dried the bathroom floor with though. 3) It is allowed to smoke on your room balcony, so the smoke from other rooms balconies got straight into our room. We are not smokers so the smoke did disturb us.",4

On the plus side, the No. 91 Aerobus from the airport stops around 150 yards away, they allowed us to check in at 10am, the room was adequately equipped, the bathroom spotless and the bedding/towels changed every day. There was a wall-mounted flat screen TV, wardrobe space was sufficient, and the products in the mini-bar were reasonably priced (2 Euros for a beer). With bus stops for a number of lines close by, getting around was never a problem, though I would have preferred to be closer to Rossio off Avenue Liberdade.  Not so good were the thin walls/poor sound-proofing which meant conversations/TV in the next room could be intrusive, and the so-called panoramic restaurant in which breakfast…",3

If you do get this hotel through Hotwire, be aware that they will charge you an additional ~$38 per night for resort fees on top of what you paid on Hotwire.  There were two desks at the front but only one was usually manned so it was slow.  The elevators were under maintenance so we had to walk up and down the stairs everyday.  They are doing some construction on the building so it can be loud.  The room was small but nothing too special other than that.  The internet is free but is very slow and didn't work at times.  Some channels on our tv would also come in and out.  The location is good.",1

The food was brilliant, excellent quality and and we had our own menu, the best selection of German wine that I have ever seen. It was my birthday when there, the staff organised a big bowl of fruit and a bottle of German champagne as a treat for my room. The room was big and spacious, clean throughout as the staff came everyday to clean it. It was located on a quiet street in a quite good area, close to restaurants and some bars. Best hotel I have ever stayed in.",5

Essentially do not wear flip flops, no matter how smart you might think they are!  All in all a lovely hotel with friendly staff in a wonderful city.",4

Lots of maintenance actually...  Receptionists spoke English, nobody else did.  OK internet speed.  The breakfast buffet was ok, but the restaurant was too crowded/busy. The a la carte menu was not impressive and the food that was served even less.   If I ever go back to Brazil I will not stay on this hotel.",2

From the beginning, I was greeted with competence and service. The Marriott App ""Chat"" feature provided quick and helpful feedback on the rooms. I had a request and it was taken care of before I arrived. Awesome to see things done right the first time, every time.  Location is good, easy bus access from Tegel. It's near public transit and accessible to shopping on Friedrichstrasse.  They have interior facing, updated rooms that are incredible. There was no tea kettle, but one was brought up almost instantly.  The breakfast was expansive with lots of options for all tastes. It was a bit busy, but the staff…",5
2282,"My first visit to Madeira. Flight took off on time. Impressed by the brief transfer time, clocked at around 5 minutes. The downside to such a brief transfer is, of course, aircraft and their close proximity to the hotel. However, one gets used to this. And for those who don't know, the airport at Madeira is number 4 on the World's Scariest Runway! This is due to the crosswinds that the island experiences. As you come in to land you get a view of the runway which does look a little ""not fit for purpose""..... I guess with the island being so steep it is a little difficult as to where a runway could be built.  Now for the hotel: checked in with no problem even though we did arrive before the check-in time of 2.00pm. I think the hotel has something like 250 rooms. Reception is 1st…",3

A very disappointing experience - truly the worst value for money I have ever experienced in all my travels.  The room is big but looks nothing like it does in the website pictures!   Service is attentive and friendly in general. People at the front desk are kind and will allow for late checkout. They would also kindly leave chocolate truffles every day at our room. The location is  very good for those who like to stay at Recoleta and wifi worked properly in the room.  But that alone does not justify the price!!

The hotel is a little out of town but close to the train station so easy access to the city and main attractions (only 3 stops and the trains are fast)The rooms are a good size and have a nice new feel, very clean and comfortable.  Breakfast  buffet is good, the freshly squeezed orange juice and meatballs were a hit with my family.  Great supermarket next door and local restaurants are also good.  I would definitely recommend this hotel. ",4

The rooms are not big, but well appointed and the materials used for the room decoration are of very good quality. The bathroom is nice and clean . The little balcony overlooking the flowery courtyard is very cute and fantastic for having breakfast .

2293,I visited the hotel over the weekend. I went to Lisbon for a business trip. The hotel is a 5 star hotel with clean rooms average breakfast. They need to refresh their room towels. Also they need to upgrade their breakfast. A cook that could make omelets would really improve their breakfast. The swimming pool is average and the Hammam too.  The staff is polite and professional. They helped us in all the cases and I would like to thank them. The hotel is located in a good spot.  Finally the view for the VIP lounge at the 19th floor is amazing !!!,3

The hotel's clean, well located between Las Ramblas and the harbour area and the staff are friendly.

Granted it's no Hilton, but if you're flexible with your expectations and want a good deal this place is a great find.",4

This isn't a minimalist, contemporary hotel with staff who don't talk to their guests but a lovely, warm, comfortable hotel with staff who go the extra mile to make their guests feel welcome at every opportunity. The hotel rooms have everything you need from comfy beds to bathroom products and even the airport bus to Nice stops outside. A very enjoyable weekend, thanks to all the staff at Le Cavendish.",5

This for me is the only thing that lets this hotel down",4

I didn't touch anything in the minibar and wasn't told anything about costs that were on my card at checkout.   I only realised I had the charges on the card when I was emailed a receipt a day later... I was told that my balance was 0 at checkout - there was no transparency about costs and that really put my back up.  I have rung many times a day for a week and haven't got through to anyone to refund me. I have emailed multiple times with no reply. I have given ample time to respond. I haven't heard an ounce back. It is disgraceful.  The service has been terrible and I'm not going back. The management all need to review this and change their attitude.,1

The breakfast was good, plenty of choice and you could have as much as you wanted.  There was an underground stop just at the end of the street and a very good Italian restaurant if you didn't want to go far.

A bright street lamp was overhead all night and just past the hedge we parked against was the traffic of a four way stop sign.  It was loud, bright, awkward (when the morning staff arrived and we were trying to sleep with our heads out the tailgate - absolutely no privacy).  How they can charge money for that is beyond me.

The bedroom ceiling has black mould that has been overpainted but still visible. The TV is about 15 years old and the windows are filthy dirty. I am attaching pictures to prove what I am saying is true. An amazing historic building that is not being looked after, what a shame. There is no artwork in the rooms and a very old horrible carpet, covering a superb floor if restored. This needs investment, when a gin and tonic costs 20$ with hidden expenses and a shrimp salad is 24$ why isn't it happening, obviously greed. Unfortunately I have another 3 days here. 1 positive is the staff, very friendly and attentive. ",1

Breakfast is very good quality, this is France, so don't expect bacon and eggs but you can expect tasty continental choices.  If you're desperate, try the scrambled eggs and warm ham.   We rarely use our hotel for dinner, because we like to experiment and sightsee until late in the evening, so I can't comment on the menu.

However, on hostelworld it said that each guest would get a table and chair in their rooms which wasn't the case, and working on my laptop on the second bunk wasn't very comfortable. The hostel itself is also located pretty far from the city center, and the area doesn't feel safe after dark.

It doesn't even really pass muster as a regular Marriott, and I'm surprised the JW flag hasn't been pulled. It really mars an otherwise world-class brand. The sub-par experience started at the front desk, with an enormous wait despite no line and then an unhelpful/unfriendly clerk. Rooms are average at best. The Japanese restaurant did impress a local I took here, but was meh to me. Concierge was hard to find, and not helpful when located. Overall, poor value for the money,",2
2319,"I reserved, and was charged for, two Queen rooms to sleep 4 members of my family.  I received one Queen room and one ""Petite"" room - which sleeps 3.  That is a very critical difference and made what should have been a great night in the city a huge hassle.  Will not stay here again.",1
2320,"The hotel itself offers some lovely restaurants and meeting spaces, facilities are fantastic and conference centre was ideal. Unfortunately what let down the hotel for me was the rooms. They were clean but they could do with a bit of updating. For a hotel that hosts so many business conferences, I was the most disappointed at the fact there was no safe available in the room, which meant I had to take everything with me of value every time I left. The heating was on and off in the room leaving me sweating some of the time and freezing the other, and I felt like the bathrooms had a drainage problem as there was a slight smell at certain points throughout the day. Other than that, the hotel does offer a great breakfast, and a very fast free wifi, with taxi services always available…",4
2321,"We selected this apartment hotel for a family holiday in Amsterdam. Our group included two grandparents staying in a one bedroom for two, and a couple with one child in a larger one bedroom for four. Overall we liked the location and the style of the apartments. We thought the service was very friendly. There were, however, a few issues.  We reported a missing remote control for one of the blinds in the living room which is also a sleeping area on the pull out couch. This was never resolved. The apartments were very hot (mind you we were there during a hot period) Fans helped somewhat. The front window was a French door which could not be opened because there was no protective screen/grill. Someone could have fallen to the street if it was opened. The hotel advised us to keep…",3
2322,"I've never had a less helpful welcome to a hotel. We arrived at the hotel at mid-day and didn't expect to check in, just wanted advice on parking. A man with a clipboard was watching the huge queue of people checking out, I asked if he worked for the hotel, he confirmed that he did, I asked for advice about parking and he refused to give this and told me I had to queue simply to get parking advice. The off hand way in which this was delivered was astonishing but even more astonishing that there is no concierge service separate from checking in and out. We weren't impressed to pay £27 each for breakfast to be seated at a small bar table in the bar, I'm sure the huge queue that followed us was even less impressed to have to wait for breakfast. The cleaner was in our room post…",3
2323,"We spent four nights at the apartments and were very pleased with the cleanliness and the facilities. We had a one bedroom apartment with three single beds in the bedroom and a double sofa bed in the lounge. Check in was fine with friendly English speaking staff.  Whilst our room did have a balcony it did not overlook the Ramblas but a narrow street to the rear of the building. Not the most stunning view - just roofs and chimneys but it was very quiet.  On our arrival we had expected a room safe in which we could  keep our passports, currency etc. There was none so we asked if we could leave our passports in the office safe. They agreed to this but next day kindly brought a safe to our room for us! The apartments are well equipped to make snacks or breakfast with an induction…",4
2324,"We went to the Alma Porto hostel because friends told us about this hostel. The hostel itself has everything you need and we needed only a bed, a shower and a plce for our backpacks. Breakfast was also availeble the and so we had really a very nice stay there. We slept in a commen sleeping room but on this time there were no one else there and so we had the hole room for ourselfs. If you wanna tray a hostel in Porto, who is not so known by the travlers like some outhers, check out theseone and <i think you won´t be dissepointed.",3

The air con wasnt working, I complained about it twice only to be told the first time it was because it hadnt been that warm and they hadnt switched it on completely,the second time they said someone would look into it but no-one came back with anything. it was 29 degrees outside so somebody should have thought about that, had to turn it off and open the window and got eaten alive by mosquitoes. The staff were fantastic, very friendly and helpful. As it was only a 2 night stay wasnt too bad but if you are staying longer look somewhere else.",3

2327,"The NH Museum Quarter is ideally situated at walking distance from the main museums. The personnel at the welcome desk were very friendly and permitted to check-in before 3 PM. However, our room with a view with water view (number 215) needs urgent repairs. The curtain had several rips and the air-conditioning was only working at the highest speed. The rug needs to be replaced because of several stains. The breakfast needs to be better organised; several customers complained that items on the buffet were not refilled on time. Not worth 240 EUR at this moment.",3
2328,"There were so many hotel options in Barcelona, it was difficult to decide on one, but we are glad we chose the Midmost!  It was an easy and direct walk from Placa Catalunya where the Aerobus (direct bus from the airport) drops off.  The front desk staff is very helpful with assisting in booking tickets, advice on where to go, and directions.  The location is great - right down the street from Las Ramblas, right next to several metros, and a walk around the corner will take you into a charming maze of streets with shops and restaurants.  There are several 24 hour mini markets across the street as well.  Our room, while small by American standards, had more than sufficient amenities (including a large small mini-bar]fridge, and heavy bathrobes and slippers!) and opened up to a…",4
2329,"""Urban utility fee"" is what they charge at the end of your stay $25 a night, cost us $116 for four nights, this was not mentioned at the start of the stay, the clincher folks is that this was for wifi,coffee,gym & a pitcher of communal iced tap water in the lobby. Our trip across the U.S was pre booked through a travel agency & this was the only place we encountered this rippoff. The staff were bland, our room had maintenance issues but this ""fee"" was the one prompting my warning via this site. Will strongly recommended Escape Travel never book clients to this place again.",1
2330,We booked this hotel for tonight through Friday as part of our San Francisco vacation. We drove past and were turned away by all the homeless people living outside and wandering the streets. We booked a different hotel near Fisherman's Warf instead. Very disappointed.,1
2331,Perfect location. Rooms were little small. Master bathroom shower was very tight. The overall apartment was good and had a lovely living room with dining table. All in all a good location to stay. I recommend this. ,4
2332,"I chose an option that did not state 'Shared Bath"" and was quite expensive.  The hotel told me that CancelOn charged a large price to me but only paid them for a sub-standard room which is why I was given a tiny room with no shower or toilet.  When I called CancelOn they wold not even try to help me.  They should have made clear this was the type of room I would be given or could be given. This was a business trip so very inconvenient for me and soured my whole trip.  Next time I will call hotel directly to ensure I do not get screwed.",1
2333,"My wife and I just returned from yet another fantastic weekend in Berlin. This time we stayed at Motel One at Leipziger Platz just next door from Postdamer Platz and the new Berlin Mall.  Pros: - Fantastic location. The best we have tried. - Nice clean rooms  - Great service from staff - Free Wifi - The best food court just next door in ""Berlin Mall (2nd. floor)"".  Cons: - No hand sope dispenser in the bathroom. They only provide body-shampoo !! - Aircondtion to hot for us even on lowest setting. - No safety deposit box in the room - No closet in the room - Construction site right outside room (they did not work in the weekend)",4
2334,"We had booked Deluxe Twin Room prior to arrival. Yet, when we arrived there, we received a 30-minute foot massage voucher fir one person from a reception staff and then got the ‘unacceptably unclean’ Superior Room instead. They had not informed us at all why we got this room and that voucher until we asked them. They answered the room we had booked was under maintenance, so they gave us the voucher. I bet this was a kind of cheating, because they really should have informed us about the room maintenance before we arrived. We had to deal with the staff regarding this issue for 1 hour. As a result of this, we got another cleaner Superior Room and 2 welcome drinks vouchers. Still, we could not stay at the room type we had booked prior to the arrival.  Also, the breakfast buffet was…",2
2335,"Very pleasantly impressed with this hotel. We were able to use a 4 for 3 nights deal, but even if we'd paid all the nights we stayed this would have been well worth the price. The room was very clean, a good size, great bathroom and a small fully equipped kitchenette. Though we didn't have breakfast in the hotel, coffee was very good, and brunch here seems to be a bit of an institution (and it's halal!) I'd definitely stay here again",5
2336,"I was there for a business trip, and everything was excellent. The room was comfortable and the A/C worked properly, as it was really hot outside. The staff was very helpful and nice, they know how to treat their guesses. There is a supermarket nearby and it is also close to many restaurants, the beach and the train station - around 10 minutes walk.In sum, a very recommendable place to stay.",5

2338,"I have just came back from staying here for a city break with my partner to celebrate our anniversary. The hotel was lovely, very comfortable bed & pillows, heating & air conditioning, toilet/wet room was very nice. Everything was lovely & clean. The staff were very pleasant & helpful. Wifi password is given on check-in. We didn't use the restaurant as we are not vegan & fancied having something else, but the smells coming from it were very nice.  The s bahn/train station was only 10 mins walk from hotel, from there you can get into Alexanderplatz, great for shopping. The trains are cheap & very regular. The only small drawback was that the only English speaking channels on the tv were news channels. Overall a very lovely stay and we would definitely stay here again.",4
2339,"Charming, clean, well-run hotel.  The staff cares about the place and it shows. The hotel is located 5min walk from the metro station.  It is about 9 stops to city center but that’s a benefit, as you are away from the touristy areas after a long day of sightseeing.   Nearby there are many restaurants, grocery stores and shops, even a little park across the street.  Rooms are on the smaller side but nicely decorated.  Bathrooms are a good size and there is a small dining table and a kitchenette. Things that could be better:  lighting over the bathroom mirror and at the bedsides are inadequate for reading/doing makeup. The kitchen had no knife/cutting board.  Windows could be upgraded to block out more street noise. ",5

I have tried several (more than 7) different hotels and I always end up paying more than USD 250 per night with awful value.  This time I ended up in the Tryp Berrini, and checked in at 8 PM. At check in I let them know that I had to join a conference call at 5.30 AM for 6 hours, and that I will be dialing a 0800 toll free number, to which they tell me that THERE ARE NO WORKING PHONES IN THE WHOLE HOTEL. Yes, you got it right, a USD 250 per night, business hotel, in a business district with NO phones.

2342,"A nice quaint hotel run by friendly people. We arrived quite early but our room was already available. Situated just off Rembrandt Square makes location its biggest selling point. Although quite loud outside, the windows blocked out an impressive amount of noise. However, we think that there should have been a small amount of tea/coffee facilities provided. There is also no elevator and the stairs are very steep. One of the lamps did not work and there was some wallpaper coming off the wall. Overall a pleasant stay but a couple of little fixes would go a long way here. ",3
2343,This hotel was a perfect location enabling us to get to all the top sights very quickly by walking or using the metro. Staff were all very friendly and more than happy to give recommendations of where to eat. Room was small but clean and tidy with complimentary toiletries. Would definitely return.,5
2344,"Basically, you're getting what you pay for at the Ibis Budget. The staff are churlish, the hotel smells, the communal tea and coffee area is filthy, the elevators are dodgy and one is very small which can be problematic when many guests are arriving at once.  The rooms are clean though old and in desperate need of a refurbish. The beds are clean and comfortable and very much safe to sleep in. But their frames are old; they shake and squeak. My room did not have a window and ABC didn't work on the TV. The rooms don't have private fridges or tea and coffee facilities which makes for awkward small talk in your pjs with other frazzled guests having tea in the lounge. The housekeeping is done daily but they're rude and there don't provide you with a 'do-not disturb' sign so there's…",2

The room quality is terrible, toiletries are poor quality, bathroom is tiny, electrics are antiquated and often don’t work, breakfast was horrible. Only good thing was the location. Just a very poor experience I would never wish to repeat.",2

The water from the shower always ended on the floor causing some problems. Terrace at top floor was nice. Overall the building needed some more maintenance, I guess it was part of the porteno decadency. Expensive comparing to the service.",2

However, they would give me the night I wanted at a higher rate ($229) and I would have to stay two nights.  I asked if I could have the second night at the original rate and I was told NO.  I would have to stay for two nights at the higher rate; or not get any room.  This did not make any sense to me at all.  If the hotel is sold out how can you up sale the room.

We all moved to another property and did not receive the classic…",1
2350,The hotel was nice but the location was poor and the service could improve.  Arrived with family and stayed in two of the standard rooms. The rooms were very 'standard' and there were no decent views from the window. During our stay there were a few functions so I believe it could be a great place for business travellers but probably not so good for families and couples. The location is far from the main centre of the city and there was not too much to do in the area. The staff in the hotel were quite rude at times and we found that the younger staff were much more helpful. There was one young boy on concierge who went above and beyond to help. There are many nicer hotels in the area or closer to the city centre that I would recommend over this one.  ,3
2351,"This hotel suited me as it was close the U5 line allowing me to access the east of the city for my work but only about 10 minutes into Alexanderplatz. My room was  a good size, clean and well appointed. Breakfast was also very good with a range of hot and cold selections. The hotel had a bit of a functional feel. One not so good experience. One morning I was not so well and put up the do not disturb sign. Felt better in the afternoon and when I went out at about 2.30, I asked for my room to be made up and cleaned. The receptionist apologised and said that the staff had now left so this couldn't be done. Not what I would expect of a 4 star hotel.",4

The hotel was close to the centre of Alexanderplatz, and easily accessible by train, tram and city tour buses. The hotel staff arranged for the tour ticket as well. The breakfast was excellent. The hotel has free access to the computer and printer also which was a bonus. Its located in a quite street, we had a good nights sleep before our exploration of the green German capital. highly recommended for budget travelers.",5

The location is very good, a short walk to Place de Catalunya and the infamous Las Ramblas, ideal for exploring the city centre on foot.  Finding the hostel again might not be so easy as the only sign is on the entrance pillar and is about 6 inches square.  Make a note of the surrounding cafe names or you could spend a long time finding it.  The staff are friendly but in our case, not good at maths.  We paid 10% deposit but this wasn't taken off the final bill (paid in advance) so the cost was more than we expected.  They have been very appologetic about the mistake but not actually refunded the overcharge.  Also expect to pay a 20…",4

People would leave breakfast because the noise was so loud. At the front desk the clerk and I couldnt hear each other during check out. In fact ear protection might be needed it was so loud.  The hotel staff was displeased but 'held captive' by the reno. Clearly the senior hotel management has not thought through with their construction company the best way to renovate. For example, per the staff maybe it would be smart to jack hammer after breakfast service concludes? I would highly recommend not staying until after their hotel is complete.",1

The rooms are small but clean and comfortable and serve their purpose for a short stay. Any longer than a week and you might want to look elsewhere. The breakfast area was modern and clean with tables and breakfast bar arrangements but the choice available was somewhat limited.   Bike hire is available straight from reception, but we walked over to the nearby U-Bahn at Wittenberg Platz which gets you pretty much anywhere you want to go.   The staff were always polite and helpful.  All in all an excellent short stay base to explore Berlin I'd you're on a tight budget.",4

I had booked a family room and at the reception, we were given the bed linen and towels to arrange our room by our selves!!! The room was very hot and was not air conditioned, even the windows couldn't be fully opened. The breakfast cost 8.50 Euros per person ( very high compared to other similar hotels ) but was quite average. When I complained regarding the inability to open the window, I was given a table fan on a 20 euro deposit. It was not worth for the money I paid at all",3

What I realize now is that there is a great disparity between rooms, which alters the overall comfort of the visit, and...with so many interns now working at reception and as waitstaff....the personalized relationship with experienced staff members has also diminished.  We always knew the staff well and felt they were extremely accommodating.  This changed.  Frankly, some of the hotel rooms are in dire need of updating. I know some rooms are fabulous, as I've stayed in those previously.  However, in the room one of us had on this trip, there was a comfy bed with down pillows with a small balcony.

I know all hotels take pictures of their rooms in favourable light but this place takes the biscuit.  Construction taking place. Minor disturbance they call it.

Everything was clean and we did love the space. The kitchen area was perfect and the bed was comfortable.

The rooms are well furnished, but could have been a touch cleaner (nothing major wrong, just a bit dusty and cutlery drawer had a lot of crumbs). The kitchen wasn't particularly well equipped either.  The building is really interesting- a converted ware house and the location is excellent- close enough to walk to anything in central Amsterdam, but far enough away to avoid the stay parties. There were some really good restaurants and bars nearby too.  Would consider staying here again if we revisit Amsterdam.",3

The Staff speaks English but majority understands only the basic.  One of the major problems that it is a first time that I faced in a 5 star hotel, is to wait for a taxi for more than 30 minutes and the staff did not take any action.  In general I would not recommend this hotel for this price.   If it was in the range of low hundred then it can be acceptable.  ",2

The hotel has a very nice breakfast buffet and there a a ron of places to eat within walking distance. The staff is very helpful.  There was a table for Viking Cruises in the lobby so it looks like the cruise line uses the hotel a lot.",4

The room was comfortable, clean, and updated with automatic shades, large windows, and things like in-room coffee and a useful office desk. I would only stay at this hotel when returning to Paris.",5
2379,I chose this hotel but son realised that I have made a mistake. I was not helped with my luggage on my arrival. The domestic cleaner did not clean my room till 16:00 when I had to phone the reception. I asked for a little check out when I was arrogantly refused. I would avoid this hotel at all times.,1
2380,"This was just awful and only booked because of a positive review on trip advisor. We booked a suite because that was all that was available. It was grim. I just can't describe adequately how grim. Tired, completely outdated and in a poor area. No decent restaurants close by. Breakfast was inedible and we were so glad it was only for one night. Plenty of room in the suite but none of it space that we wanted to use. Awful!",2
2381,Fairly standard 4 star city hotel. The breakfast was generous and offered a good choice.  Beds were really very comfortable. Reception staff friendly and helpful.   20-25 minutes to downtown Lisbon (Baxia-Chiado) metro which includes a change. About 25-30 minutes to the airport.,3
2382,Very unhappy with this hotel appearance and the hotel rooms - words can't do it justice for the price paid.  The room flooring was buckling.  The kitchenette was very outdated and dirty.  The bathroom was needing a paintjob as it was flaking off in many places.  I appeared that there was water damage at one point that only was painted over vs ,1
2383,"The room was neat and clean, the location great (trust me, I lived in nearby Nogent and I know what I'm talking about). Most specifically, the people were lovely. Unfortunately, I cannot remember names, but I remember the experience. I had a small breakfast and a great talk with the young woman who was there at the time, while enjoying the cozy living room, books, and tv.",5
2384,"The hotel is located about 10 minutes by foot from Potsdamer Platz. Considering the very reasonable price, the rooms are adequate. Our room was clean, big enough for two and quiet. Breakfast was nothing special, but good and perfect to start a day of sightseeing in Berlin. The reception personnel was also very friendly and helpful.",4
2385,"The hotel itself is clean and very grand. However the service is terrible. It made our stay uncomfortable. The cleaners pay no attention to the 'do not disturb' signs. The breakfast was bland and tasteless and the wait staff (with the exception of the French lady in the suit) were rude and not helpful. When the breakfast area was busy they just let you wonder around and wait to find your own table. The concierge staff/ bell desk spent most of their time sleeping on the couches in the foyer and were not helpful when getting taxis. In regards to the location, I would recommend finding somewhere closer to the bund too. Taxi drivers were very hesitant to take us out to the hotel, however on a positive note it was near the subway.",2
2386,"I stayed here over the weekend for a long weekend for my birthday. The hotel is a 2 minute walk from the nearest tube station with links straight to the city centre, it costs just over £5 for an all day transport ticket which includes buses too. On arrival we couldn't check in until 3pm which is the latest I have ever know for a hotel, it seems very late, most hotels are around lunch time? We had a very early flight too which meant a lot of waiting around however we could leave our suitcases in a secure area behind the desk so that was good. Our room was really nice, the decor was very modern, the beds were very comfy I had a great night sleep every night. There is little to no noise in the corridor or outside which is great and unheard of in most city hotels. We made use of the bar every evening, there is a huge cocktail list, they cost around £10 each but are lovley. The bar lady was great too. The hotel is in a suitable quiet little area where there are coffee shops, takeaways, an Aldi and a gym right outside the door. It takes you away from the hustle and bustle of the city which is just 2 miles away. I will certainly recommend this hotel to family and friends, and hope to visit again on my next trip to the lovely Berlin. …",4
2387,"This is not the place to go if you are looking for a peaceful and quiet vacation. We had trouble checking in at 9:30 p.m. with so many seniors getting out of the restaurant, which is the only restaurant the hotel has, and closes at 10p.m.! We found that to be way too early! The rooms were spacious and comfortable but overall we did not enjoy our stay because all the activities were fully booked!!! Management did try to offer alternatives, but we did not feel special at all here. This is a Disneyworld Resort without Disneyworld. We found it to be terribly overpriced for what they offer. The hotel is a US$350-500 max stay, and instead we payed US$700+. Would not go back!",2
2388,"Maybe I got unlucky, but I cannot recommend this hotel.    The hotel itself was fine.  It is clean, safe, and in perhaps the best area in Sao Paulo.  I upgraded to the Executive Club level, and the afternoon tea-evening drinks were decent.  Nothing extravagant, but served the purpose as I worked in the lounge for a couple hours.  Breakfast was pretty good.  Nothing overwhelming, but lots of choice.    I think the above would warrant a solid 3.5 review.  Not outstanding, but pretty good, particularly for Brazil.  Issue #1:  on Saturday morning, I went down to use the ""24 Hour"" gym.  The gym itself looked reasonably good with lots of equipment for a hotel.  However, the staff had closed the gym from 8-10am for cleaning.  During peak morning hours??  I was very frustrated as this…",2
2389,"I was on business in Sao Paulo and stayed at the hotel for a week. At first glance is a nice hotel, but once you get inside is not. The room was big but the heater was broken so the room was freezing during the night. Moreover, every evening when I returned from work I found the windows open so it was already cooler than comfortable. The hotel lobby roof panels were off and covered with a piece of paper and tape, which was disgusting, even in the breakfast area. By the way, the breakfast was the only thing nice and complete. Also, the hotel had a policy to make you pay each time you surpassed $500 USD, which was really annoying.",2
2390,Good size rooms for Paris. Great location. Clean updated rooms and comfortable beds. Upper floor accommodation are relatively quiet with windows closed. Good air condition and modern bathroom. Friendly staffs ,5
2391,"I was one of those people who had good feelings about Vinpearl resort. However, this visit changed my mind. Staff seemed kind of friendly, but in reality they were like shepherds for their convenience and they had to abide by it. When I checked out, I promised to pick up another hotel to pick up. They asked me to take on big bus to the hotel on a narrow driving way, and they asked me to take them to the hotel. "" They said, "" I'll take them to the hotel door. "" We had to move with one of the seven children and the 18-month-old baby and six bags. In fact, if the employees said they were impossible from the outset, they would have chosen different ways. But we believed that the employees were talking and eventually they dumped us on the side of the burning sun in the scorching heat…",1
2392,"Visited for five nights in January 2017. The hotel is located close to Europa Center, KaDeWe, Tiergarten and Kurfürstendamm.  The room was tidy, well furnitured with a desk with enough space for working and the bed was comfortable. The en suite bathroom was clean, but the shower could have had higher water pressure. The breakfast is alright, but nothing out of the ordinary. ",4
2393,"Where to begin?   This centrally located hotel is a gem of a find - my second Sir hotel and boy does it maintain the standard!  From the cosy winter garden with its roaring fire and uber cool sofa swing, to the courtyard watched over by it's giant Art mistress - it's just coolness everywhere but without pretention.  Hungry? Grab a fab burger at ""The Butcher"" where the staff (just as in the reception team) make you feel so comfortable you could be staying in a friend's home.  You have funky friends! 😂  The rooms are compact but again beautifully created.  Super comfy beds, a stylish rain shower, nice toiletries and a well stocked minibar hidden in what looks like a bureau.  I can't say I found any faults with this place - check it out!",5
2394,"Well firstly, rooms and hotel are clean and well kept. Spacious and well laid out. Pool well kept and could always find a sun lounger.   Spa fantastic, had an amazing facial and could not fault the staff in there.  Location is good but very hilly, prepare to work up a sweat walking into town and back.   Beerhouse restaurant by the marina best place for lunch and best G&T we've ever had.  Food VERY hit and miss, mainly miss. Breakfast good but dinner was poor, way to much salt and oil and bread often stale. Weird choice of food and can only say I enjoyed dinner on 2 nights.  They also claim in the restaurant you can't have tap water so have to buy water, only to find out its €3.75 a bottle when we paid our bill!!!! Shocked and disgusted. Water should be free and I think it's…",3
2395,"As many guests have reflected in their reviews this St Regis isn’t as good as expected from this chain.   I travel to Shanghai a few times a year for work and the St Regis is located very close to my office in Shanghai. On previous trips I have stayed at other hotels in central Shanghai and the stay has been very pleasant. A key requirement for me on business trips is for the breakfast (included in the room) to be delivered to my room. It has never been a problem at the Shangri-La, Ritz or the Four Seasons in Beijing, Shanghai or Guangzhou respectively to deliver a small selection of the breakfast (including hot food to my room) so I was very surprised when the St Regis said they would only deliver bread and fruit to my room. They should reconsider this policy to bring them in…",2
2396,"My whole stay, the mirrors in the room all dirty, dust everywhere like it’s been there for months. Dirty towel on the floor never was picked up, tub was never scrubbed, they said the were going to clean when I was away to dinner, came back to nothing cleaned- WOW!? Never again",1
2397,"I really enjoyed this cute hotel, the staff was really friendly and available, always happy to help. The location is great - between the Eiffel tower and the Arc de Triomphe. I used to live in Paris years ago (not in this neighborhood), and this stay was a nice reminder of how nice Paris can be (for a few days... ;) The room was small (like in most independent hotels in Paris) but comfortable and clean. The pastries in the morning were delicious; I would just have liked better tea to be available, and maybe the industrial cheese and yogourt to be replaced by something else.",5
2398,AC didnt work in my room Toilet wont flush Many mosquitos in the room Power outages in the room  Good things: Room service is great Restaurant is quite fair Staff is very helpful and kind Cleaning personnel was very very kind,2
2399,I cannot fault the place! Awesome view outside my window of a lovely church. Extremely comfortable bed. Could’ve stayed in the shower for an hour was lovely! Keep doing what you’re doing!!  Don’t hesitate to book here. ,5
2400,"First impression was not too bad, but after 5 minutes with the unfriendly staff it all went downhill. They have a lot of offers, but just for Party tourists on how to drink more. For ,normal backpackers' nothing to get out of there. Breakfast was officially included but when you want your free coffee all you get is instant, for real coffee you still need to pay. Same with the food. You get a bowl of fruits for free, but have to pay for the yoghurt, and if you want muesli you have to pay the whole price as in the menu (3,20€ which is ridiculous for Vietnam) because breakfast consists only of fruits.  I definitely don't recommend this place unless all your looking for is drinking specials and fake friendly people. ",2
2401,"Stayed here for one night before our cruise and then three nights when we came back.  Staff is great and went out of their way to make us comfortable.  Breakfast was just ok, mostly just for the convenience of it.  Make sure to ask for a back room as the ones in front are very noisy at night, right on the street.  Lots to do within walking distance of this hotel and many restaurants.  Don’t think I would want a long stay however as the bed was not the most comfortable.",4
2402,"Location is the only positive thing about the hotel.  I had a very negative experience during my stay in August. I am Brazilian, currently live in the US and went back to Sao Paulo for work. At check in on a Wed, I asked if we could add an extra bed in my room (who can fit 3 people according to the reservation).  They said sure, they had plenty of beds and all rooms could fit additional ones. I confirmed that a few times including Friday morning a couple hrs before my Mom & dad arrived. Unfortunately, when she arrived they said that extra beds were no longer available (in two hrs they completely ran off beds, which is weird given that hotel was empty) and she had to get another room.   I tried to argue with them, but their response was that I only asked about the bed and did not…",2
2403,"We found the Adagio suited us perfectly. It was in walking distance of a U Bahn which took us everywhere we wanted to go. Buses were readily available as well. We were one block away from Kurfurstendamm - one of the main shopping strips in Berlin. We found the one bedroom apartment to be more than ample for 2 people. It was clean and comfortable. It was only serviced once a week but a change of towels etc is available for 3 Euro . The staff were very helpful and friendly. Lots of restaurants in the vicinity and even though we were in an area where there were lots of hotels we didn't find them too expensive. Lots of good local restaurants as well. Lots of good coffee shops around the area, too. We'd definitely stay here again.",5
2404,"A stay at one of the Ibis hotels in Europe is always a safe bet: clean and functional, with a decent breakfast assured.  This hotel is within walking distance of a lovely Christmas markets and excellent shopping areas, as well as close to some of the main sights.  It is certainly good value for money.",4
2405,"Stayed here 3 nights on Hyatt points.  Check in was pretty easy as we arrived in a rental car and parked in their free lot.  The lot is a short walk from the reception area, which is down a walkway and then down some stairs.  They held us to the check in time however, as we arrived at like 10am, and did not get into the room until around 2.  Staff were pleasant.  Location here is the one great thing.  You get phenomenal views from the room and even better from the porch area, where you can sit and have breakfast in the morning.  Honestly though, you can get these views from the public walkway up above the hotel. Imagine a walkway with shops and stuff on each side, and on the caldera side, there is a roped off area with stairs that lead down to the hotel.  You can stand above and…",3

I specifically looked for a boutique hotel with very good reviews because I had some special requirements due to a health issue.  Before arriving I asked if they could help me every day with a special diet (I am temporarily being fed through a feeding tube).  I needed boiled chicken breast, rice, 1 banana, some green beans and carrots.  Everything boiled without any condiment and they told me they could do that.    The previous day we were arriving I sent an email confirming that everything was ready as well as an extra bed I requested for my son.

On the last day after breakfast suddenly not able to go inside the room. After went to receptionist found out the card need to be extended. There's no sorry whatsoever, seem it's common 6. There's hair at the pillow when i checked in 7. The most important is no safe you can use. There's common key code to open it.

Good location by the busy street with shopping and lots of people, no problem with sleep at night but abit of ""citylife"" noise you have to accept.  Got my shirt ironed quick and service was just perfect, fast and polite. I have nothing to complain about and think It realy suits for a couple of days.",4
2410,"I came here last year, I had food delivered. They insisted that I had to go down to the lobby floor to get my food. At that time the lobby was the second floor. I complained then that why would I spend $500/night not to be able to get food delivery from uberEats/Grubhub to my door? They didn't get it.   My last trip last week and this trip this week, I had to find a hotel close to my client. I begrudgingly booked it because my other colleagues were staying there. Last week I followed their instructions and the food came to the 2nd floor and I got it. This week everything is different.   This residence inn is a joke. You're better off staying in a different brand where they care about the convenience of traveling professionals.",1

Extremely friendly and super gracious staff. They went out of their way to make our stay as memorable as possible. We had booked a garden view suite thru TripAdvisor and they even upgraded us to partial ocean view with a balcony. Will definitely return.,5

I do want to point out I’ve stayed here on three different occasions and did notice staff being rude towards one another and customers. The first time I thought it was because they were having a messy and busy day? But later when I came back I noticed it is an everyday thing.   I saw this one situation where a customer was trying to explain something in a very limited English, the girl at the counter literally said “I don’t know what you’re saying” and started serving the next person.   They act like every person that walks in bothers them. It’s like they hate being there, they hate the people they work with, they hate customers.   I would still come back to Generator because, as I said,…",3
2416,"This is a basic hostel in a good location. The main issue for us was the noise, the cleaners were very noisy in the mornings (starting early!) and the room we had was adjoining another so we could hear everything under the door. Other than that it's what you'd expect - relatively clean, breakfast was decent, the staff were very friendly and helpful. ",3
2417,"The location was great. It’s near public transportation and a supermarket and there are a lot of restaurants around the area.  The room was a little small and basic but worth it for the price. It was also clean and we despite the small area, we were still able to move around with our 3 luggages.  They have laundry area in their basement which we were able to use. They were quite strict with check-in time but it didn’t bother us that much. Would stay here again.",4

There were 4 hotel staff at the lobby and NONE of them had the courtesy to acknowledge us, to talk to us, or to offer any attempt to solve the situation.

A tiny fan that blows hot air around the room to be precise. Weather was hot so it didn't make for an enjoyable nights sleep. I suppose the thing that annoyed me the most was the shock I got when checking out. I got stung with taxes I wasn't aware of when booking the room. I was aware of the facilities fee ($15) for really poor wifi as I've mentioned. Other taxes were added to my bill totalling more than $50.

From the room size to the free mini-bar to the polite service to the rooftop pool, it was a relaxing getaway from the crowds and the sun, all while being close to shopping, restaurants and the beach. During this trip, I did stay one additional night in Cannes at the Martinez as I wanted to stay “on the beach”...this is a mistake I will not make twice as the Five Seas was a much better choice!",5

But the service we experienced at Marriot Hotel City Centre was of such bad quality that have out-balanced these upsides.   A few examples:  1) They don't have the electronic ""do not disturb"" button and on the first day we didn't notice that you need to use one of those old fashioned paper signs hanging on the doornob and so we didn't use it. The next morning, around 10am, while I was working on my laptop and my partner still in bed, the service lady opened the door WITHOUT knocking nor ringing the bell. I was stunned.

They told, that my credit card didn’t work. My card works very well by the way, it was certainly not a problem with my card. I asked the proof of the credit card refusal and of course they didn’t have it. When I called them, they told me that it was too late, and that they didn’t have any option for me.

It took us over 30 minutes to get chairs at the pool and employees simply advised us to walk around a majority of the time to look. There were two individuals offering other guests narcotics for sale while in the pool. The bed looked as though someone had already taken a nap in it, and the phone was filthy with crumbs. For a hotel at this price, I don’t think I’m asking too much to simply have a clean room, pool chair, and drama free experience. I’d stay somewhere else.",1

Location can't be beat as it is 3 minutes from the metro/RER direct from Charles DeGaulle airport. It's around the corner from Notre Dame and the Shakespeare Book store and a 20 minute stroll to the D'orsay museum. There are lovely dining spots all around and it's also an easy stroll to the Marais.  The price especially if you book direct on the hotel site is fair for everything you get.

I have some quibbles with the room that bothered me enough to elaborate. It did not surprise me that the room was smallish, but I was disappointed with its layout. The owners chose stylishness over practicality. For example, I found little shelf space for toiletries in the elegant bathroom (which, come to think of it, was disproportionately large, so space was available).

The room has a safe and a fridge.The bed and pillow were without a doubt the most comfortable I have ever slept on the pillows gave you a choice and the very soft one was ideal. I usually take my own but need not have worried, the receptionists cleaners and most of the staff were very good.

The location is great -  the main line station and metro Gare Saint- Lazare is 2 mins away, with 5 mins to Galeries Lafayette and the Paris Opera. If you take a thirty minute stroll in one direction you will be in Montmartre and Sacre Coeur, go in the other direction and you will be in Place de la Concord and at the river Seine. The area around the hotel is full of fantastic little restaurants, bistros and patisseries - just ask for advice and direction from the Reception, the Villathena staff are the friendliest, most professional and helpful people that you could wish to meet. The rooms are small, spotlessly clean, shiny little bathrooms, comfy beds, wi-fi that works! We highly…",5
2439,This place is really prettily decked out. And the flats are set in a quiet part of town. But we weren't convinced that the owners were as honourable as they made out. When we left they insisted on taking a nip out of our deposit for nothing as far as we could see. Overrated.,2
2440,"This is a budget hotel, so it is basic, additional services (wifi, hairdryer, ...) cost extra. No breakfast, there is a coffee and snack vending machine. A typical (young) tourist hotel, so some of the noisy guests enter late at night. This being said; staff is very friendly, rooms are clean. If all you need is a bed, this is a very good option.",3
2441,A room for four people that would not been comfortable for two not to mind three people!!  When is it appropriate to have a semi transparent glass panelled bathroom in a hotel room that is apparently appropriate to sleep four people!!!!  Rude staff- in fact lying rude staff- they acknowledged that the room was too small and said they would move us the next day- not what happened.  This was supposed to be a treat for my friends daughter and her friends at the end of a backpacking holiday but as it turns out they would have been better off in a hostel,2

It is well situated. The staff is super helpful and friendly. I speak French, but I know the staff speaks English and other languages. The rooms are beautiful and clean. The breakfast buffet is unbelievable.  Water, juice, coffee, soft drinks and snacks available in lounge at no charge and in all Astotel hotels to any client in any of their hotels. I just cannot say enough good things about the staff! You will definitely not be disappointed with your stay!!",5

There was a weird smell on the landings in the floor we were on, not sure what it was.  A good base for exploring Amsterdam.",3

2447,Me and my girlfriend booked the hotel for 7 nights with no breakfast. The location is perfect being 5 minutes walking of leidsepline.  The hotel has serious problems with house keeping. During the second day of our stay we received dirty towels and during 2 days they didn’t bring shampoos and gel bath. They made me go downstairs and bring it due to the explanation that the house keeping finished their day. This is unacceptable in a 3 stars hotel.  Also the hotel is very noisy at night. You can literally hear each time when someone (even underneath you) closes the door and the air conditioner made a lot of noises at night.  During one of the days at 7:00 o’clock at the morning the hotel decided its a great time to begin maintenance in front of our window: knocking on something…,3
2448,"I stayed here for two nights.    When I arrived I noticed a foul smell in the bedroom, like an open drain.  But it was late and I was tired, so I ignored it and went to sleep.  The next day I had a look in the bathroom and noticed one of the floor drains had been covered over with duct tape.  The hotel were obviously aware there was an issue with drain smells and had tried to rectify it by covering the drain.  The problem is, the drain for the bathroom floor is probably connected to the drain for the shower, so any smells were still coming out of the shower drain.  After I spoke to reception, I was put in another room which smelt noticeably fresher. They said they did not know there was a bad smell in my original room, but I find that a little bit hard to believe.  They must have known there was an issue, why else would there be duct tape over the floor drain.  The hotel should not be using that particular room until the drains are fixed properly.  It is supposed to be a four star hotel.  Even in the new room I was given, the toilet seat was disgusting.  It looked like they had tried to clean a bad stain off it and the chemicals had attacked the surface of the plastic toilet seat.  Surely at this point you replace the toilet seat, rather than expecting customers to use it.  Like I said, this is supposed to be a four star hotel!…",2

We were then woken early Saturday morning by staff on strike outside marching and banging pots and pans (who were extremely friendly regardless of the circumstances). We have reached out for a refund as our stay was in no way worth the near $400 we were charged for two nights, nor were we aware we would bare witness to a protest/strike.",1

It's not, the rooms are outdated, they charge for poor Internet access in the room, the room temperature cannot be controlled, and the desk staff acts put out if questioned.  I was here for two days and could have tolerated most items but not controlling the temperature is very annoying.  If the room gets hot you cannot cool it...very disappointing.",2

One of the breakfast staff people shooed me away and acted like I was stupid when I asked her where the butter packets were. Someone else moved a couple things around to find them for me. We had to wait for plates for over 5 minutes all 3 mornings and there was never any seating or trays to carry the food up to our room. They didn't alternate the food daily like they were supposed to and they ran out of pastries every day also. They would only bring like 6 towels at once to the pool so they ran out all the time and it took over 10 minutes to get more brought up. The corkscrew in the drawer in the…,1

The room was tiny no where for our suitcase to be stored & a tiny wardrobe, also very noisy due to thin walls. Although the bed was made the sheets were not changed the five nights we stayed which for £150 is poor. The breakfast was unappetising , cold boiled eggs, bread & ham. Three restaurants were recommended to us by the hotel which were all extremely poor but expensive, I believe recommended due to a affiliation through the hotels family. So do not ask the hotel for recommendations of where to eat!  There is a small bar which provids three…",3

Can't wait to visit again.",4

Also, my reservations were screwed up, I had t call and straighten them out a 3rd time.  This, after a young lady at the hotel told me I needed to hurry-up because sh was busy.  this was 2 days before my arrival.  Also, there was a terrible odor in the bathroom and hallway underneath some towels that were there.  it was like pulling teeth to get them to do it.  Lastly, I just came from participating in tournament play, and didn't have my ID.  It was the host hotel, and they knew what was going on.

The room was clean and tidy when we arrived. Clean towels. The room has a queen bed and then a single bunk over the top, which was perfect with a child. The blind kept the sunlight out in the morning and the windows were fab at soundproofing the traffic outside. Great location for exploring Berlin.  Check in and check out , was easy and staff were really helpful and friendly. ",4

Only time can tell if this will continue, but a very small example is the small plastic caps that are supposed to cover the screws in the shower - 3 out of 4 are already missing.

The staff is friendly and service minded.",3

The rooms are poorly built e.g. furniture is slanted, open sockets, door are not closing properly etc.. General staff seems very junior.

Upon check in I was upgraded to a room at the club (top) level with club lounge access at one floor down. Things went downhill from there.  The room felt moist and damp despite the A/C being set to 20C. The A/C itself seems to emit a smell of mold that can be distinctly detected each time entering the room. Everything else in the room worked well though and the room was generally well kept. At the later few nights, service started going down. It started on the 3rd day when the cleaning staff took away slippers and bath robe in the morning and the evening turn-down service maid did not return them. At night #4, still there was no sign of them returning. I…",2

Staff is friendly, but everything feels just as “business as usual”. The facilities and (at least) my room are very tired and shabby - dents and spots everywhere. The bathroom did not feel hygienic, as it was full of marks and spots as well, the shower angles full of mold. I will definitely avoid this place in future.",2

The rooms were good and spacious, we booked a superior room to gain access to the lounge which was good value for the snacks and breakfast (hot and cold options, better than expected). We also ate the special pasta buffet put on in the restaurant for the runners.   The downsides - beds were a little uncomfortable and rooms a little noisy especially from a big wedding being hosted in the hotel 5 floors lower one evening! Luckily the disco got turned down by 10pm.   It was also amusing / disappointing to watch the staff protect the lounge - seemed some tourists got the hang of tail gating those who had access, not what you’d expect to see but also the staff seemed to lack a good register to…",4

They are doing some renovation, so the construction equipment takes up much of the space.  The security guard told us it was ok to park in the lot of the Denny's next door, but we were not comfortable with that option, so we waited to get a space.  The room itself was clean enough, the decor old and outdated, but the bed was awful.  The pillows were as flat as pancakes and the A/C didn't cool the room well, so it was hot an uncomfortable during the night.  I'd drive farther next time and pay a little more.",2

This is a bar and should have nachos, wings, potstickers, cheese sticks.    The Mariott Burger is supposed to be the staple of the Marriott chain and consistent worldwide.

The breakfast which is included was continental but filling.

The bad unfortunately is the small ways it fails to make your trip that bit more comfortable.  The rooms are tiny. Odd decisions about the fixed wardrobe and see through bathroom actually make it seem smaller.

My room had a nice view from the sixth floor over the street below and was very quiet. The bathroom was quite large with both a marble shower stall and a bathtub. The service was also exceptional. Turn-down service, a bottle of Evian, and fruit were furnished daily. The staff couldn't have been more helpful or nicer. I also thought the rate reasonable for such a deluxe hotel.  I arrived by overnight train from Vienna on the morning of October 19. around 10:00am. Check-in time is at 3:00pm. A young, blonde…",5

Central position, 100m and 500m from two U stations (or bus stops). Sleep quality was good, due to the neighborhood being quite although central (Potsdamer Platz).  I'll be back for sure, if possible.  Thanks to all the staff.",5

2502,"Spent five nights with family of four. Beautiful resort with very friendly staff. Lobby bar is a very charming place to linger. Three major flaws unworthy of a five star place 1) buffet dinner: little variety, average quality, limited fresh food. The Italian night was a disgrace with pasta choice that could not be more boring. No freshly cooked meat or fish. Breakfast was good but offered the standard stuff only. 2) prices: one hour snooker for 15€ is not only ridiculous it also kills the atmosphere in the bar since people don’t wait but leave. Same for kicker at 0.50€ 3) Atmosphere: it is not the staff but this place lacks atmosphere. It is sterile   This hotel would benefit from an owner-type manager who injects some adequate food and atmosphere.   We would not come back.",3

Left my power adaptor after check out and took many days and they are not able to recover it for me. ",1
2505,"The hotel is nothing special.  Rooms are basic and clean enough, although there was black mold in our shower.  The room we were in was noisy - night club across the street stays open until three am on the weekends.  The best part of this hotel is the Skyline Bar on the 26th floor - great view of the city and good food.  The food in the first floor bar is terrible and the breakfast is your standard buffet - overpriced and underwhelming.  The coffee situation in the morning is annoying.  Only two machines and often one is being fixed or needs to be fixed.  Large groups stay at this hotel and getting coffee in the morning can be a hassle.  The hotel is in a good location, just a short walk to the old town - location is the only reason I would recommend this hotel, however if you do…",2

They don't really speak anything other than Spanish.......I asked for a wake up call and did not get one.....was only called when my cab arrived!

Entertainment was not inspiring ,our day out was much better than staying in hotel,food was mist the same everyday fir breakfast and dinner.

This should be on the site when you book the junior suite as a warning and the price for the room should reflect this issue.

2509,"Ok, we did come here for a lowing price, but one of the two rooms was very small, and had a bathroom door which kept jamming, so that we constantly feared being trapped.  Our double bed was two very narrow singles (2.5 feet) pushed together. The covers were those low-budget duvets you get at Premier Inn.  Then on the last evening, a Sunday, our door refused to open because the battery needed recharging. The hotel offered to move us, but we didn't really want to pack and unpack twice. So the desk staff had to open the door with a pass key for us. They did this with reasonable grace, but we thought that either a repairman should have been called or, better yet, the the battery should have been checked regularly.  The hotel breakfast is very overpriced too, at 19 euros.  Luckily…",4

We chose the Carlton for it’s location and previous reviews, we arrived late evening and didn’t get to have a good look around. Unfortunately we were a little disappointed in the morning to discover the building site outside the front of the hotel, our room looked out directly onto this (we were not informed about this when booked 2 weeks previously). Also the mountain view it described was obscured somewhat by buildings, I believe the description should reflect this. The pictures it shows of the rooms are also misleading, not sure how long ago these pictures were taken but our room looked nothing like them. Disappointed that we were expected to pay for tea & coffee…",3

Kate and Anne were so helpful and friendly, our room was charming with a view over the square and the location allowed us to get around easily by bus or Metro. A well stocked supermarket nearby made it easy for us to self cater but there are plenty of restaurants nearby. Would highly recommend this Hotel.",5
2513,"Booked relatively last minute and was pleasantly surprised. Hotel is spotless. Breakfast is standard (eggs, sausage,beans, Spanish omelet, fruit, cakes) but was lovely and set us up for the day. It’s about a 15/20minute straight walk to the beach which had some lovely places for a drink. There’s always a few taxis outside the hotel which we used to go into Barcelona. The pool was a lovely bonus and got the sun from around 12-5pm. I’d recommend staying at this hotel if you want somewhere near Barcelona but has the option for a pool and spa day",4

2515,Modern clean hotel. Had a room facing the road which was extremely noisy due to the noise from cars and trams passing by - there are ear plugs in the room because of the noise. I requested to move to another room after the first night. Hotel moved me to a garden facing room which was nice and quite. Excellent breakfast and the location is great. ,4

Not easy to get to and from the city centre, not knowing the language didn't help. There is a Tram station across from the hotel which is good. Leave on Tram 12 from the hotel, change to 13 or 14 if you heading to the city centre (Dam) or stay on Tram 12 if you visiting the museum quarter.  Listen carefully to the announcements on the Tram. And note which stops you need to change at.  ",3

It's nicely decorated and the rooms are clean, modern and nice though for some insane reason my room didn't have a blind on the 10 feet high window - the last thing you need in Amsterdam.  I was in a twin room on the second night and it was good - spacious, a blind, nice en suite but as other reviews have said the pillows are ridiclous they're basically an oversized tampon.   It's not a youth hostel though that it the main market. It's location is idea - 10 minute walk from everything.

2520,"The Pestana Palace is by no means a 5 star hotel.  The room was nice but the service was mediocre.  They served the same breakfast every morning and their coffee was bitter tasting.  The eggs looked like out of a box....they looked fake and not appealing.  They didn’t even serve their guests the Nata pastry that Lisboa is known for.   A 5 star hotel doesn’t leave a guest towels with holes in them.  I just find that for close $300 euros per night one shouldn’t have to request more hand soap and toilet paper. We would not return.... Moreover, it is in a very remote location from the neighborhoods where it is happening.  The Uber drivers even got lost finding the hotel.",3

There is another hotel being built at the VERY side of it and we were told they have a sister hotel, Royal Savoy, which we could use for the gym and pool area and is a 10 min walk.  No it is not, it's a 20 min walk and we were told we could not use it and had to get clearance from our hotel as my husband had an email to say we could, so a bit of a faff.  The are around the hotel is VERY built us but once you get out (use buses,  Very cheap) the West of the island is BEAUTIFUL.  We will visit again but stay nearer the sea.  The Savoy is quite out of the way and be warned it is VERY hilly, which doesn't bother us as we walk a lot, but if you struggle then this is not for you. …",3

These three staff members really stood out for us and we thank them so much.    Housekeeping was spotty.  One of my daughters had to keep asking for towels because they would only leave one.

2527,Spledom Suites is for those who are planning to stay more than 4 days. The room has nice modern amenities in the kitchen; our room even had a washing machine. Overall the place was well designed and amazing layout. Pretty much it looks like a modern condo. The beds were comfortable and big enough us. There was a large outside patio area.  The two things I did not like. One was there was no fitness center – being fitness enthusiast it was a disappointment. Second is poor internet service.,4
2528,There is nothing we could fault about this hotel! Breakfast was great and served all the way until 12pm so you could sleep in if you wanted to. Only a few minutes walk to the beach and the center of La Croisette. EXCELLENT air conditioning which makes a big difference compared to many places I have stayed at in south France with no air conditioning at all. Staff was all so friendly and knowledgeable of the area. We received great restaurant recommendations and got tips on possible day trips we could take from Cannes. We loved hotel pruly and recommend it! ,5

At $500NZD per night, this is an expensive hotel in a top location and the amenities are top-notch but the front desk staff are very arrogant and do not know the meaning of customer service.   Forget warm hospitality. What you get here from the moment you check-in is snobbery.  They are not particularly rude. Just arrogant!   The place is popular with snobby Europeans and the restaurant staff are just as snobby.   The rooms have great views but are incredibly noisy. No sound insulation at all!! We could hear the person in the room next door using the toilet at night and when they use the shower it's like grand central station. The pipes rattle and the sound of water draining is loud enough to wake you up.   I would never ever stay…",2

Furniture definitely was not the newest but there was nothing to complain about. As well as bathroom.  Food selection at breakfast was ok, but most of the products were dairy or meat.

We decided to have a look at the beach in the meantime (only about 5 minutes walk away). As it was slightly raining we asked for two umbrellas - which we got after signing a receipt and being made aware that we should look after them, otherwise we would have to pay 300,000 Dong for each.

My bathroom looked NOTHING like the one in the image at all and had very old stained fixtures.

Bacon burnt to a crisp, fresh croissants recently replaced wit a dry doughnut, etc etc. If you do stay, make sure you get room towards the square as road side is noisy.  Never received any acknowledgement of my loyalty. I probably shouldn't so will put that down as my error. ",3
2559,"From the outside the hotel looks very grand, but inside needed to be refurbished. Room ok, no balcony. Wifi was not the best, and breakfast was very much Asian oriented. Staff were helpful. Would not hurry back. Hotel says it has a spa, the hotel even has signs for spa when I asked about it was told there was spa.",2
2560,"Had a very enjoyable and relaxing break. Once again the staff were very friendly and efficient, with a nice atmosphere throughout the hotel. Our rooms had a balcony with stunning sea views. The hotel’s location is very good, near to the Old Town and many bars and restaurants. Breakfast was first class.We have stayed at this hotel many times before and look forward to staying here again next year. An excellent first choice of hotel for anyone wishing to stay in Cannes.",5
2561,"Recently stayed here over the weekend for a wedding. Check in was simple, room was clean and spacious, but upon leaving was where the trouble hit.   First of all, I received an email that morning with my check out bill which was $60 more than my original quote. When booking, I selected the 'park and chill' option to include my parking. The check out price charged me again for parking. The front desk staff did remove the charge.  We then went down to the parking floor, and when the pulled the car around, I had a new scratch on my car. I told the guy that they scratched my car, he responded with 'did you check in yesterday because I wasn't here'. We waited for the guy to get back who did park our car. He was so defensive, stated he didn't do it, etc. They told me they would have…",1
2562,"I dont even know from where to start. Already the concierge provided us wrong information regarding the Bride Expo, saying that it will not take place. Wrong. Anyway they upgraded us to a better room. Room service made us feel we were in a cheap hotel 1*, no plates were covered, no bread, no salt and pepper, and hamburger had no tomatoes and salad. Very few people from the staff speak english which i found very strange and disappointed, my husband Sheikh Abdulaziz Al Khalifa and I are very big fans of Jumeirah. The concierge suggested us a Chinese restaurant, we went it was horrible very dirty and the food was just ""better not to mention"". So concierge service  failed as well. And in the end just like a cherry on top on the cake we came back to the hotel last evening around 10pm…",2
2563,"Wonderful, helpful staff and a huge room with our own Jacuzzi.  Bathroom a little dark and shower a little slippery but otherwise good. The hotel itself is 5 minutes away by car to the nearest town, Fira, but, if you like us did not want to rent any form of transport (in South Africa we drive on the opposite side of the road on the opposite side of the car), it felt as if we were pretty much stuck in the middle of nowhere as walking was out of the question.  There was a free hotel shuttle which was great if you wanted to spend the whole day in the town but not great if you only wanted to go for the morning as the shuttle only brought you back in the late afternoon.  We ended up taking the shuttle into the town and then catching a taxi back (cost €15).  Surprisingly there were…",3
2564,The website stated they had 2 restaurants and a bar lounge onsite. Don’t be fooled they do not. It’s run by a separate company and good luck getting a last second reservation. Impossible. No room phone,1
2565,"After seeing the rave ratings I booked for four nights. Nice and close to the station where we arrived and left from. Our room was upgraded which was lovely. Roomy and clean. Shower was dreadful! So hard to regulate, boiling hot, then freezing cold. At one stage, no water. Very dangerous. Breakfast was ok. No choice of food, just delivered. Breakfast forgotten one morning altogether, however, they were very apologetic and we were compensated. Room could have done with a bit of a brighten up too. Of all the places we stayed in I would have to say average and overpriced.",3
2566,"Location is really great! It's in the middle of Gamla Stan, the old town, right next to the iconic square Stortorget and just a few minutes to Royal Palace and other main attractions. You can also take a nice walk (approx. 30 minutes) to the island of Djurgården where many museum can be found, especially Skansen or Vasa museum.  In other aspects the hostel is just average. The rooms are small and very basic but that's what you expect when staying in hostel. You also have to pay a charge for using their sheets and towels (it's 65 SEK per person) and bring your own soap and shampoo. The walls are thin so you will hear everything but it was not a big issue since the hostel was quiet during our stay (except for one night when someone outside was constantly ringing the bell around 2…",3

At first they told me to provide my credit card details or to use 3rd person’s credit card, the additional documents (passport copy, copy of credit card and authorization form) are required so I provided my credit card details and my membership card number. Surprisingly, they changed their words that I am still required to provide the addtional documents even when it is my credit card. I explained my concern and they are saying it is for MY safety.

Discussion took place in 30 mins. 2/ facility - broken AC. I cannot imagine 5-star hotel & in Accor network, with the broken AC. I don't understand what's their maintenance plan?

Comfortable bed with a clean & modern bathroom. They had lots of meeting rooms and good event spaces for our business conference event. I needed a document scanned and it wasn’t working in the lobby business centre, the front desk was very helpful with scanning it from their own office.  The location is fantastic, literally steps to the main shopping street and restaurants. Great for a quick walk if you are short on time.   My only complaint was that the hotel lobby bar closed at 12:30am. This is much too early, even for a weeknight given that we were hosting 150+ customers. Management should anticipate big group bookings and…",4
2572,"Most of the buildings are a fair walk to the pool. The view of the golf course is obstructed from most ground floor units so the only advantage is you can park close to your unit because the parking lot is right out front. King's Land should be ""Joker's Land"" because there were few redeeming features to this property except for  discounted greens fees at the nearby affiliated (decent) Waikoloa Golf Club. The pool area was lovely and the  cleanliness was very good. The hamburgers at the poolside were excellent, although there was no pool waitstaff service.  The coffeemakers in the units had no filters. It was hard to get a consistent temperature in the units. The units were quiet and it was nice that they have an adult pool.  A better property design for the complex would do be…",2

The rooms are comfortable in size and clean and the breakfast was filling and yummy.  The hotel is in a quiet area of Paris and after a day of sightseeing in central Paris it was a pleasure to come back to this area.  The hotel is located within 5 min. of Parc Zoologique de Paris (zoo) -- very nice, and a wonderful park",5
2574,"Though this hotel is very pretty to look at and the location is lovely, I would not stay here again if it was last hotel room left in Chicago. There is virtually no soundproofing at all. Not only could I hear the traffic from Lakeshore Drive all night as if it ran through my hotel room on the 16th floor (and let me tell you, there is traffic all night long) - I could hear every small sound that occurred in the hallway. This was particularly bad due to the group of drunk jerks staying on my floor. I had to call the front desk 4 times between 11-3am that night. They would send up security and he would tell them to go to their room and as soon as they left they were roaming the halls banging on doors and making a racket. At 3am when I called down the last time I asked to speak to…",1
2575,"The hotel is on a large square which is being renovated, most of the best buses and trams serve the square, including the famous Tram 28. Check in was easy, large room and well equipped bathroom, but no tea and coffee facilities, which I think is something they need to address. Breakfast is buffet and there is plenty to choose from and lots of seating. Roof Terrace is famous for its view, and is worth a visit but gets very busy very quickly and for us too noisy. Bar in the lounge is comfortable but the barman needs lessons in customer service. For us the views are not 'pretty' but the location just around the corner to the main streets and easy transport access makes it better.",3
2576,"Very close to Adenauer U-Bahn, so centrally located. Also 109 bus in front.  All  amenities near-by, food, drink, internet café etc. The hotel is quite nice, but I found it a bit chilly in April (drafts from corridor) otherwise it is quite nice.",4
2577,"This is a very well appointed budget hotel, steps away from the metro and bus lines especially the 100 and 200 buses.  I came very early in the day and yet they checked me in immediately.  Service at the counter was fast, even though for an instance they could not locate my reservation.  The room was small but could easily fit a family of 3 with the added bunk bed.  Shower is small and you have to bring most of your toiletries.  Towels are not as fluppy but for short stay, should be enough.  There is no ref but a working wifi and TV.    I like that no one can just have access to the quest floors without the access card.  Gives you a sense of security.  Standard no frills breakfast is offered for a fee and very good.  Like to commend the lady manning the stations for reprimanding…",4
2578,"While the location is fantastic, the lobby and bar reasonably attractive, the rooms are awful. We upgraded to a ""Deluxe"" room on the 46th floor thinking we would receive a better ""product"" and could not have been more wrong. I can only imagine what the ""Standard"" rooms are like. The space was a DIY nightmare! A stark white room with roller and brush marks on the walls, cracks in the drywall,  filthy windows, an AC that barely worked and was ridiculously loud. There was even a sign next to the thermostat stating guests may not be able to adjust the temperature in the room to their liking in the spring and fall!! While taking a shower, grout from between the tiles literally fell out. We normally stay at a Kimpton, Loews or something comparable and now I remember why. Never again!",1

Even the pictures on the rooms are bizarre - a picture of thongs in our room. No details of New Years Eve celebrations. Room furniture old, fridge decrepit. View is so misleading it’s not funny!!!! We’re going to find somewhere ‘nice’ instead and just double pay for accomodation - very disappointed!",2
2580,"I've visited the hotel for the second time in March 2018 and had a very unpleasant surprise.  Turns out they charges the guests the abusive amount of US$ 10 for every package received.  I had to pay US$ 150 dollars as I had 15 mails from various sizes, including small boxes and envelopes.  Given the total amount being so high, I've tried to negotiate a max amount, without sucess. My frustration comes from the fact that I've been to Hilton Paulo Alto a couple of months ago and before that I had stayed in Hilton Homewood suites and other hotels in the bay area and I was never was charged for such service.  The hotel should at least be transparent and inform their guest on this rate, not mention the absurd of charging 10 dollars for receiving and keeping an envelope for 2 days!!! …",1

Good Points - much cheaper than the other hotels, great location just across the road from the Museum quarter and a supermarket, about a 10 minute walk to some restaurants and pubs and a further 10/15 mins to Dam Square. However the tram stop is just outside too you can jump on and off easily.  Bad Points - The room needed some tlc, very old fashioned and there was a hole in the roof and the wall. Bathroom was clean enough, the shower was good but not decorated in a nice manner and sealing from the wall to tiles not been painted over.   Overall, I would say the hotel is good if you're going to just be sleeping there which most tourists to Amsterdam do. Also, be aware it is very noisy with other people in the…",3

I have tried 2x (Monday and Wednesday this week) to e-mail this hotel at their only listed address: sales@silversmithhotel.com  I triple checked that I have the correct and only e-mail info. I have checked my spam folder.  I asked for a confirmation of a reservation I made via website. I didn't write down the confirmation info because I have never not received an e-mail confirmation from any hotel!?! I also asked a few basic questions regarding the rooms and hotel; nothing complicated. Could I call...yes, but I want a written confirmation.  The only conclusion I can draw is that they don't need the business.",1

Apprently they are all OUT. and the staffs are very rude!!! Just checked in today and I am already regretting booking this hotel. This hotel is never a 4 star. Forget about boutique whatever names and go for proper 4 star hotel chain. ,1

I didn't have breakfast, or visit the bar so cant really comment on those.  There was a function at the hotel on the Friday night, but there were signs informing guests of that, and to be honest i was on the 7th floor so didn't really hear anything.

Also a ton of restaurants within walking distance  The room was recently redone and was nice, but the AC unit wasn't hooked up yet.  Fortunately for us it was rather cool at night.    THe people were very nice and outgoing,",4
2588,There were three of us. The room was very clean but uncomfortably small and with 3 people and suitcases there were a lot of bruises. However the staff were very helpful and the hotel was in an excellent location. Easy walking distance to the train station. It was very warm in the rooms even with full blast aircon which did not seem to work. The shower was on the other hand low pressure and lukewarm. The breakfast was great but very expensive. ,4

The hotel is recently refurbished and features a nice and modern lobby, and restaurant on the ground floor.   The room was nicely designed with solid (expensive) materials, but it was on the small side, considering it was a deluxe room, twice upgraded from a standard. However, there was plenty of space for the luggage.   The bed was big, comfy and with good linen. Good sound insulation too.

The bus 171 (bus stop Storchen in both directions) take you to, & brings you directly from the airport, & Rudow underground station, which takes you to the edge of the City. Breakfast is a very good cold or hot buffet, except. if you want bacon, there's none provided, but on Sunday, you can have ""bucks fizz"" with your breakfast. Pillows are much too soft for my liking.Free wifi overall, & if you don't mind the smokers, there's ample seating outside. When the bar is closed, there's a ""supermarket fridge"" with cold soft & alcoholic drinks that you can pay for immediately or on your departure. If you're into McD, there's one next door.",4

Very polite friendly staff not a bad location at all easy to walk to La Rambla/ food market. Great Bluetooth speakers fitted on the ceiling. When you get there they charge you €100 incase you have any room service or use the mini fridge. Taxis always outside the hotel 10min taxi journey costing around €8 airport taxi did cost us €50 which was quite expensive. Great place to visit lovely roof top pool and bar! I would definitely come back.",4
2596,"Simply adequate. It won't blow your socks off, but the room had everything I needed and it had a good bathroom.   Provides breakfast, but as far as I know you cannot get dinner here.  The location helps you get around Berlin quickly, as Checkpoint Charlie and a subway station are both within walking distance.",4
2597,"Pros 1. Located in the heart of Japan Town. 2. Nice staff.   Cons 1. The TV screen suddenly freezes.  2. The bathroom has echo, so any noise sounds pretty loud. The door on the toilet opens not in a traditional inward motion but outward. There is no separate light for the toilet and shower. So, if you go to the bathroom in the middle of the night your spouse will be awaken.  3. The coffee machine makes mediocre coffee. Perhaps offering a Nespresso would solve this problem?  4. Nearest Starbucks or Cafe is within 10-20minutes walking distance. 5. Walls are paper-thin. You will hear your neighbors having sex, talking loudly and slamming doors. 6. Far away from the center of town.",1

Stupid me, later, i discovered there was one in my Qatar airways night pack from economy class.  Informed the hotel to expect my luggage coming in the next day.  Shower was good. Room was warm and nice for winter. Hotel wifi worked well. This allowed me to contact friends and cancel appointments premade for the next morning.

The drain in the bathtube and sink were slow. The one window we have was super tiny and the curtain didnt draw closed. Also the bed was supposed to be a queen and instead it was a double. The room was laid out poorly. Too many things to just goto the desk during a holiday weekend and hope they can remodel this room. So sad. Lastly, the lobby smelled of some deodorized I'll say  and it stuck the hotel even elevators to the point of being offensive. WHY????",1
2605,"This hotel is very good but if you're expecting exquisite luxury and impeccable service, it falls slightly short. Little things like coffee served tepid, stained serving tray linen, staff tattoos on display, very limited beach service so if you want a drink you get one from the Black Rose pool bar opposite, beach not raked to rid it of litter etc, shuttle bus service finishing too early so you have to organise (an expensive) taxi.  Our room was beautiful. No criticisms there at all. When the plug didn't work in the bath, an Engineer was out within minutes. The bath is really deep and large...more like a hot tub. Fabulous. A good hotel but some things not quite to five star standard.",3

2607,This hotel was recommended to me by a colleague and didn’t sissy any of our party. Hotel was clean and the staff were more than helpful. Quite often going above and beyond to help. Liked the free minibar and the nespresso machine in the room.  Room was perfect for our stay; with a fantastic shower I was in heaven. The room was clean and kept clean and replenished throughout our stay. The location for us was perfect. It was close to Montmartre district and either a pleasant walk or ease of access to the metro. Thoroughly recommend hotel.  ,5

This hotel is well located only a few minutes from the Sagrada Familia with a pedestrian street nearby with lots of cafes and restaurants and possibly just as important just across the street from a subway stop which allows you to explore Barcelona very easily. Our only real complaints was the late night noise which came from other guests, it appears to be amplified either through the plumbing or vents in the bathrooms and because there is no staff on duty after 6 pm there is no one to keep things under control. We experienced noise 3 of the 4 nights of our stay after midnight, mostly very bad drunken singing. The apartment also has a small clothes washer/dryer combo which washes okay…",4

So depend how much you pay for night  Kosher food: we payed 45 euro for Friday night, they served only the chicken no fish. Food was good but very expensive for the country ",3

We start with the $65 a day valet parking, or the option of self parking for $48 a day with no in and out. Maintenance is poor. The beds are comfortable. The adventure begins in the morning. There are three options available for the early riser who wants a morning cup of coffee. These options are needed because the hotel does not provide the regular single cup coffee maker found in virtually every hotel room around the world. Option 1) wait until 6:00 and order coffee from room service. No one is available until then. Option…",1

The hotel is in a quiet residential area, just a short walk from the city center, we will definitely stay there again.",5

When one was requested, I was told there are only a few in the hotel, when paying a premium for a four star hotel, this is completely unacceptable!

The hotel is in a lovely area overlooking the marina,Lagos town is a short walk away and theres a large super market in the opposite direction.The rooms were very spacious and were well equipped.

We kept the windows open just to be able to breath, but the noise from the streets made it impossible to sleep. Between ambulance sirens and honking cars we were lucky to sleep 2 hours at a time. To top off this terrible vacation we were unable to take a shower for the 5 days we stayed here!!!! They claimed to be replacing the hot water heaters and shut the water off from 11am to 5pm three days in a row, but even when the water was on the shower was either so hot you couldn't stand it or so cold you would freeze.

2626,"I had been wanting to visit this hotel since its opening was announced. I had meticulously saved HHonors points to be able to visit (i'm a HHonors Gold member). We spent 4 nights here.  I think our disappointment was a result of booking 2 of the nights with HHonors points. We were given a smaller room than what we had booked. We were supposed to have a king bed and a room with a separate bathroom with tub and double vanity. Instead, we were given a TINY room where we literally had NO WHERE to put our suitcases. I even showed the front desk the pictures of the room type we had reserved. (Yes, it's a heritage hotel and most rooms are different, but we got a size smaller than we should've had.)

These two properties have two very different stories to tell. In Maui, the Kanapali beach setting is just gorgeous with tons of natural beauty. Not too crowded, great activities with the kids, just a great location. I did have a few issues but I’ll leave that for a review of that property.  Ko Olina is a master planned community that reeks of corporate development. Upon entering the area you are greeted by a security manned gate that opens in to a golf course reminiscent of a Palm Desert resort. The Disney resort is the first thing you see and with an abundance of security everywhere, it looks, feels and…",2

This could pose a problem if had ironed your clothes before arrival. There was an element of living out of suitcase but, it was not too much of a hinderance. We were giving a free beer and token for water on arrival. This proved handy. The rooms were nice with a large tv which, you could mirror your phone to. Beds were comfy and ther was an open sink, shower & toilet area. This might be a problem if u stay with someone u do not know that well but, for us it was absolutely fine. The only small issue we had with the room was that the tissues and shower gel were not replened when we had run out. I am only mentioning this because this…",4

The people are generally helpful although many did not see to be very well trained and up to speed with what is needed.

Rainfall shower with fragrant shampoo, body gel, and conditioner. 8. Interesting visitors from all age groups and ethnic backgrounds (and no noisy kids!).    NEGATIVES: 1. Housekeeping is hit & miss. They'll make the bed, but not clean surfaces or damp mop the floor (no carpets). No excuse for that. Also, the coffee and sugar in the room were never replenished the entire week. Nor was the box of tissues. No bueno. 2. The food can be improved at breakfast.…",4
2636,"Beware: beyond the name, the great location, the experience at the Indigo Shanghai is disappointing. This is mainly due to the very poor quality of service, not at all at the level of price and standing of hotel. My reaction may be due to the fact I was on a business trip, tight on schedules, looking for settling jetlag, and the effect of haphazard service was enhanced on me: ""hours"" to get checked in, with a very junior staff obviously overwhelmed. When I came back in the evening, they had kindly changed my room as asked, except my luggage had not been moved, I had to do it myself at midnight, internet not working, unreadable bill given when checking out.

The hotel is not in the main part of Rio, and is away from the action so not the best for new tourist visitors to Rio. It took almost 2 hours on a Friday evening to get there by car from the airport, although this was a holiday weekend and roadworks so probably an exception. It took about an hour going back. I was there for work, but if there as a tourist, I would be disappointed on the location as it is so far from the hot spots like Impanema/ Copacabana and the tourist attractions.

A bit noisy on the lobby floor, but a pair of ear plugs sealed the deal.  Very basic breakfast. No bread left in our second morning. They were out of bread since it was sunday and the bakerys closed. The bread was bought the day before and they were out of it. I don't care about that, if it says breakfast included, it better be included! We were goin to check out early the third morning before the breakfast started. We asked If we could have some breakfast to go, since they didn't give us any the day before, but that was not possible since the bread arrives the same day. What? isn't that contradictory?

One of the good things was that the toilet is self enclosed meaning one of us could be in the shower or using the sink which didn't prevent access for the other one to the loo if you like privacy.   The main disappointment was breakfast. We stayed at other boutique 5 star hotels on the same trip which were streets ahead with breakfast service.

Room was big but needs plastering and a like of paint as showing signs of wear.  Breakfast was appalling, no service and lots of mess around vacated tables. Really disappointing. Look elsewhere ",2

We were really looking forward to our stay here but were disappointed with the hotel service. The room was amazing with a beautiful view over the beach. The breakfast was good with great options and helpful staff. The front desk staff however were inexperienced and lacked communication skills necessary for a five star hotel. The resort is still under construction which we were not informed about and lead to us having to get out of a taxi half a km from the hotel on a dark night.

2647,I booked this hotel for 1 week business in Shanghai. Unfortunately had to check out after only 1 night. This hotel is not really a Sheraton as I expected. Very old not really up to date hotel. Something is wrong as also the personal was not really motivated. In the Lobby some tables dirty found even nobody around.Price definitely by far to high for the service. As already others wrote before here I walked only 500 meters down the road and found real Sheraton for same price booked over App!( there I found the normal good service known from Sheraton.,2
2648,Horrible service. Rude front desk. Old rooms that are extremely unimpressive. You can easily hear your neighbors in some of the rooms as well. Check out the Conrad or the London House instead. We had to change rooms and ended up checking out early to go to another Hilton property. After checking out the invoice for the room price had doubled. It had a beautiful lobby and is classically beautiful. Check out the lobby and enjoy a drink if you can but we won’t be staying here ever again. ,1

Check-in is efficient and grand, though breakfast service is falling behind multi-stars property with not enough seats available for the guests when running high occupancy levels (with 10 min wait to be seated) and no service after you eventually got a table.  The room is OK though the position of the TV was strange and almost no (free) internet access - as explained by front desk attendee, it's due to a wrong wing we had our room in!",3

The hotel staff was friendly, helpful and available. The bed and bedding were good. The mattress was quite firm...to my liking. It had a rain shower head...also to my liking. My room was on the 8th floor so there was no traffic noise.   The hotel, generally is in need of updating. The carpet in my room had some stains. I felt the hotel was dingy rather than dirty.

We had breakfast and dinner at the hotel and every ting to our fully satisfaction. The diner vas what called buffet, what's means self-service.

She also charged my room for internet use so that I can send her copy of my reservation via email, even though I wasn't even checked in as a guest!! When I simply asked more about the internet fees, she had the nerve to say this was ""standard in all four-star hotels!"" -not true, since I just stayed in two other 4-star hotels in Sao Paulo that didn't have a internet fee, and THIS IS NOT A 4-STAR HOTEL BY ANY MEANS, even for Brazilian standards.…",2

Well,  Big mistake. First of all, for some reason,  My booking was made twice -  2 books on the same day – by my travel agent.  So I called hotel directly, asking them to change it – making the reservation 2 consecutive days instead of on the same day, I was told that they were unable to do that.

(Hotel is reasonably quiet given its location.)  Would only recommend this hotel if one is doing business in the area or taking the train.  Also, upon arrival, there was only 1 person at the front desk.  As there was some confusion with our Booking.com reservation, a line rapidly formed at the check in counter and people were clearly getting frustrated.  1 person at the front desk seems a little thin to properly check people in and assist customers.",3

No evening meals, other than snacks, small cocktail bar, but there is plenty of choice just a short walk or tram ride away.

The staff seemed unfriendly with not a single good morning at breakfast or a hello as we passed the main desk every day. The coffee at breakfast came from a machine which dispensed instant coffee or sweet cappuccino. The only good thing at breakfast was the fresh bread but the toaster was so old that it was a mission getting the bread toasted. We gave up on pre dinner drinks as it seemed obvious that we were interrupting the dinner service. The rooms were adequate but dated with furniture that was falling apart. The bathroom was a disgrace. The toiletries seemed to be in short supply as one tiny bar of…,3
2681,"Its almost impossible to find a hostel in this price range that has a pool and sauna without no extra charge.. and excells on other criteriums aswell. The staff was really helpful and nice. Loved the free tours. Our tour guide was Lili, who had all sorts of fun stuff to show through out the outing and took interest in all of the group members. Will definitely visit Plus Berlin again!",5
2682,"After reading reviews was expecting so much more. Sadly it is a big let down. Positives - the lovely helpful people at reception.  Warm smiles, helpful regarding restaurants,  quickly helped us get bus to Dalat organised, good sized room, close to restaurants and shops. Negatives - no elevator (not a big problem), air conditioning not working well or cold enough (was a big problem), tiny towels,  tiny duvets not fitting the bed, wet paint on bathroom windowsill. I love Vietnam and dont expect New Zealand standards but ive stayed in better in Nha Trang for the same price so sadly cant give this hotel a better write up. Try CarpeDM for great value at the same price. ",2
2683,"The hotel was a great find. - Located less than a mile (17 mins walk) from the Eiffel tower, with a view of the tower from our balcony. - It was also less than a minute away from the nearest metro station. -The hotel offered a buffet breakfast for an additional charge, albeit the vegetarian options were rather limited. - The staff was very professional, helpful and friendly. - The rooms were small (as expected in Paris) but fitted all the amenities nicely. - The bathroom door did not lock, which could be a big problem for some.- There was a bakery/cafe just outside, which was perfect for sitting and sampling a few baked goods.- There was also a kebab shop on the other side, for those looking for a quick bite or halal food choices nearby.All in all, it was a really good stay and…",5

Be careful if you pay for a view because apparently the photo attached counts as a view - the big blue building opposite. Even after flagging this with hotel staff they were still adamant this was a view. Housekeeping didn't empty bins for days. They often threw bedsheets over the bed but didn't actually make the bed. Fan in bathroom didn't work neither did locks. Very noisy all throughout the night with numerous people in vans climbing into skips to empty into their personal vans, diggers filling up skips and street bins being emptied at 2am. Did not have one goodnight sleep our whole stay. Had issues with the hotel wanting to…",1

2686,"We had a superior room on the 1st floor which was spacious,and comfortable with a desk and chairs. There was no noise despite facing the main road. There was a separate bathroom and toilet with an excellent bath and shower. There was plenty of choice at breakfast which was rapidly replenished in a light and airy room. The receptionists were very pleasant and smiling. The only minor quibble was that the safe was too high in our room and I had to stand on a chair to access properly.  But overall, again a fantastic stay.",5

2688,"I stayed in this hotel 3-4 times because of its location, but I will no longer stay here. Service is very poor -- from bell boys who ignore you if you arrive in an Uber and not a cab, to haphazard room cleaning, to a couple of incidents I've had with the reception while arriving at the hotel in the late night.  The rooms have a perennial wet carpet smell -- it's probably because the windows in that place haven't been opened in a very long time.  Plusses: Breakfast was good, and servers was attentive. Location can't be beat.",2
2689,"Total and complete let-down is the only way we can describe our stay. First, we were assigned to a room in the 'quiet section' of the hotel, that just happened to be part of the route to the hotel's pool and spa. We've barely been in our room and we already hear people (kids) yelling at each other as they make their way to/from the pool. My husband went to reception to ask for genuinely quiet room and was told they only have ONE room left (in the the entire hotel!?) and it's an accessible room on level 6. We went there and it was quieter except we kept getting whiffs of cigarette smoke through the vent the entire stay. We discovered there was no coffee/tea making facilities in the room and when we inquired with the front desk they said they can send along an electric kettle and…",1
2690,"Beautiful hotel. Very well kept. Staff are in parts extremely friendly and helpful, although at times; short and slow in service (especially the 8th floor bar where table service is terrible).   Food in main buffet floor is good. However having eaten a meal in the A La Carte tonight we were utterly disappointed. A bland starter, and having waited over an hour and fifteen minutes; for two main courses (in a quiet restaurant) was to say, more than a disappointment. The meals unfortunately were overcooked, lacked attention, did not resemble the menu, and ultimately were a disappointment.  Also the hotel is quite a distance and a €70 taxi ride from the center of Funchal (the capital) from the hotel intended.  Overall; a beautiful hotel with lovely staff and service. But food and…",3
2691,"We loved this hotel. The location was fantastic, breakfast was amazing and the private pool access was the highlight. Service here was top.  Only downsides: 1. We had a room on top floor. It was ridiculously small, even by euro standards. We couldnt fit 2 suitcases in the room. 2. The balcony upgrade isnt worth it. The balcony faces basically a white wall.   The private pool access is a game changer and makes the hotel worthwhile.",5
2692,"This is a big hotel and you should expect the big hotel experience. Little or no atmosphere, cavernous dining areas, pleasant but otherwise vacant staff and a lobby that is crowded with people.  Also, apparently guests are now also contributing to the training of reception staff. Our trainee must have seen more on my driving licence than I could, since it took her about 20 minutes to read the information that she needed - and even then required assistance. Needless to say, check-in was an exercise in patience.  Apart from the convenient location (not far from the Hippodrome), the beds and pillows in the room were just my cup of tea. Very comfortable and allowed a good nights sleep. The breakfast was also brilliant - volume and variety were the key. There was no wondering whether…",3

2696,The hotel location is perfect at the Potsdamer Platz. Rooms are nice and spacious. Service and breakfast are good.  Things which I didn´t like at this hotel:  - No complimentary water at the room. This should be standard for a hotel with this class - The parking with 30 Euro per night is too much. There should be at least a little discount for hotel guests. If I saw a spot I parked usually on the street in front of the hotel,4

We had booked our stay nearly  a year ago as we planned our 6 month trip to Europe.  We arrived at 3:30 pm, the front desk staff were busy.  We were told the room type we requested was not ready and we could wait for one bed or we could take a 2 single bed room.  The front desk staff we interacted with was rude and snobish, no welcoming reception for us.   We asked about an upgrade, were told the hotel was fully booked.  We were given room 806.

Architecturally the hotel didn't disappoint, nice clean lines, great views over the marina and river, nice (small) roof terrace. The food in the Feitoria was really good and the treatments in the spa wonderful. I don't disagree with the other reviewers here I just expect a little more by way of service when I am paying these kind of rates:  When we arrived we booked a table at the Feitora, we asked for 8 o'lock and were told that it had to be 7:30.

If you are thinking of booking this expecting a W quality - save yourself the money and book elsewhere.  I've included some pictures of my room for reference.

Instead, they gave us a room at the Canaves Oia Hotel for the first night and promised a change for the next day. The room was modern and new with an extremely large bathroom, however we were very disappointed we didn't get to stay in a Junior Suite like we originally booked. We didn't even know there were 2 separate locations (Hotel and Suites). There was nothing we could do though since they said there weren't any available.

The rooms is small - no wardrobe and just enough space for the bed and small desk but it is clean. The bed is very comfy with very nice linen and the bathroom is small but large shower with rain shower and sufficient hot water. Absolutely sufficient for an overnight sleep. Breakfast was also ok and great value for 10 eur. The accommodation is around 100 eur, which seems to be great value for Berlin. The location is also good. Close to the zoo and shopping area.

2709,I spent a wonderful week @ this refurbished family run hotel. Stephanie & all of the staff were so friendly & helpful. The hotel had such a relaxed atmosphere with an almost spa like feel around the pool & bar area. My room overlooking the front garden was immaculate always. The location is so perfect nestled in a quite spot between the ever bustling and exciting  Croisette & Rue D Antibes (shopper's paradise). Fabulous restaurants all around & the beach a short walk away. I really had the most enjoyable stay ⭐️,5
2710,I liked the atmosphere in this hotel. The rooms are a little dated but very clean and even those in the front overlooking the street are very quiet. The whole area was convenient to all sights and felt very safe. The bed was comfortable; breakfast very tasty and best of all- staff were very professional and friendly. WiFi had a good signal. One of the receptionist gave us lots of advice on walks nearby. The barman was also very helpful and cheerful. There is a small chapel in the basement and Martin Luther King stayed here once! The airport bus goes from the next street so that is very convenient.,4

The rooms are quite large, as are the beds, and the bathroom was very well appointed and scrupulously clean. Despite being on a major thoroughfare the rooms are well soundproofed and traffic noise was not a problem, even for rooms at the front of the hotel. Though the furniture and TV were very dated they were perfectly adequate, as we spent most of our time out sightseeing. Breakfast at 12 euros is not cheap, but the views over the city from the breakfast room are outstanding. There is a bus stop just outside the hotel which is convenient for the city centre, or the U-bahn at Adenaur Platz is a 3 or 4 minute walk. We found the 7 day travel pass (zones A and B) excellent value.",4

The bar downstairs served us a cheese platter with the oldest cheeses and fatty meats possible; the brie had no cheese in it ... go figure!

There are also many bikes for hire from various places outside the hotel and you can quickly get to lots of places from here.

The dinner in the first floor restaurant was a buffet. The food would not appear to a westerner at all. Decided to order dinner alacarte on their iPad, then was brought the wrong order. Waited an hour for correct entree and gave up. Went to the now destroyed buffet and swallowed a few inedible bites. Gross dinner.  During dinner, the head server? insisted I pay cash for dinner, even though I had 3000 deposit on my room. She insisted it wouldn't cover the meal. She kept interrupting our dinner meeting.

The room we booked online looked amazing, hence the booking, regardless of the price being a bit higher than we had booked elsewhere. We arrived by train, had a surly young taxi driver take us to the street, not the entrance which is closer to the park, but once we got to the right place the park/grounds of the hotel are beautiful and the building looked amazing.  When we checked in they advised us that the lift we needed to access our room was not working, understandably this happens at times, however they pointed and gave us general directions to our room - this place is huge and it was like a maze,dragging our suitcases to the one working lift to go to our floor, up and down…",3

It is clear that the hotel is under new management since my last visit and this has made a big improvement.    The lady working on reception was excellent, very friendly and helpful. I was given a room on the top floor which had a nice balcony. The room was spotlessly clean, the bed was very comfy and there was nothing negative that I can think of.

2733,Noisy. Hotel is between two striking hotels. Staff can move you to 33rd floor and it's still as noisy. Strike hours end midnight and start 6am - which gives you less than 6 hours of sleep. Avoid until the strike is settled. Still waiting to hear back from GM - been over a week. ,1

2735,"This Hotel is a disappointment. The lobby looks very nice and modern but the rooms are like a medicore Motel on an old Highway.  We had black mold in our bathroom. The bold thing is the extra prices they charge you. First, there is the resort fee of 25$/day which our front desk guy described includes ""free"" beverages in our mini bar.  Which are 2 mini bottles of water (100ml each) and nothing more. Also, it should include beach umbrellas and chairs which were not available on any day we ask and we needed to rent them on the beach again for a whopping 25$/2hours. Then there is the parking fee of 30$/day even for guests.  So if you think going here be aware of the extra fees they charge you which includes nothing but disappointment.",2

Breakfast is ok but not outstanding - other hotels of the same categories serve better ones regarding variety. The sauna area is tiny, a small sauna and a bigger steam bath. Staff is very friendly ",4
2737,Stayed here for 2 nights for work. It’s not close to any of the tourist attractions so would not recommend if you’re in Lisbon on holiday. The rooms were spacious and the beds comfy but the decor and the bathroom were very old fashioned. The whole place was in desperate need of a refurbishment. The breakfast was fine. The WiFi wasn’t great; it was very weak and kept disconnecting. ,3

Other branches of this chain have facilities on site, for example the spa  is at another branch which is a 30 minutes walk away! not practical when you want a massage!   Overall it is a lovely hotel with clean tidy rooms and good service. ",4

The service at the desk was top-notch and very accommodating. The only thing that was not positive was that the elevator is very small (like two people, or one person with a large suitcase) and exceptionally slow, so it was almost faster to take the stairs, even to the 5th floor. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.",5
2740,"From outside nice hotel, inside typical business hotel without charm. Rooms are small but convenient, bed quality good with rather firm matress and nicely light feather duvet but unfortunatly stone-hard pillows. Bathroom has minimal ammenities. Tissues would be a much apreciated ad-on. Breakfast is pleasant although in the basement without daylight.  Wifi is free, speed is just sufficient for work.  Overall a good impression and to recommend for business meetings.  Note to the manager: please try to improve the friendliness of the check-in team. My entire check-in was done while being on the phone, without a personal word or eye-contact. Thank you. ",3

Thats probably the reason to stay at the hotel. It is pretty far from downtown and during a rushhour period, I was almost late for an event.  The hotel is a 5-star and everything worked. But there are quirks. The gym opened at 8 am. Food in the restaurant is expensive; transport from the hotel is too, which is strange considering a swarm of taxis available just by walking out to them. There is no shopping there.  I would not recommend the hotel for anything beyond a conference.",2
2742,I booked this hotel when there was a flight mix up with weather delays. Then 15 minutes later needed to cancel. Biggest mistake ever and worst customer service!!! My reservation did not say it was non-refundable but customer service line informed me that it was and then refused to connect me to hotel manager. I advise you to book other properties at O'Hare and steer clear of this one as they offer terrible and impersonal customer service accompanied by zero flexibility and hidden no-refund policies-- all in all the last things that a stressed-out traveler needs!!,1
2743,"Friendly staff, the setting of the hostel is pretty, close to the center of Amsterdam.  Two negatives, the room was not very well cleaned .. There were cigarette butts left and the bathrobe left available was not clean either .. The small trash cans in the toilets were filled with used sanitary napkin ..  The second negative point: the other people put their music too loud in the morning so you are woken up quite early and even cook at 2am .. I think there should be some rule regarding respect for others, such as  example do not give access to the kitchen after 11pm.",3
2744,"I can only conclude that the number of raving reviews on this site were written by persons whom have never paid for accommodation, shills or guests blessed by sheer dumb luck. Oracle frequently books their clients into this hotel, as it is right next door. As a large customer of this company(Oracle) I will personally strongly encourage them to book clients in anywhere, but at The Le Meridien. There are far better options in the vicinity, and even a famous luxury boutique hotel offered 4 nights(same room type) for the price of three nights at Le Meridien). I confirmed this with a quick internet search.  Two of us paid $429 per night for 5 nights, that excluded breakfast. This also did not include internet usage. This establishment started surreptitiously charging our credit card…",1
2745,Hotel Therese is located 5 minute walk to Louvre.  It’s a small boutique hotel with the MOST helpful staff. Breakfast is wonderful mas well as 4:00 tea. Rooms are good. Only negative is that neighborhood is very quiet at nite. I would certainly stay here again.  ,5
2746,"We stayed in the beach front villa for a few nights over New Years so we definitely paid a premium for the room. For the price I paid, I felt it was totally not worth it and probably would have gotten a much nicer resort in Nha Trang or Da Nang.   Room: The villa itself is dated but acceptable and was kept quite clean. Super close to the beach but there were loads of people so it wasn't that peaceful/nice to chill outside. Good bathroom amenities but hot water did not work on the 2nd day. They came to fix it right away when I called which was great but left the sink drainer deconstructed so the drainage pipe smell filled the bathroom. The hot water was fixed for a day and stopped working the next day we were leaving which was fine but we did have to endure a quick cold shower in…",2
2747,"I recently returned from Paris where I spent 15 fantastic days at the Hotel Saint Jacques. I had stayed at this hotel last year, and upon leaving, promised myself I would return as soon as possible. If anything, this second stay was even better than the first.  The hotel's location is excellent. I was able to walk just about everywhere I wanted to go. For the places too far to walk, there were several metro stops nearby.  I loved the Belle Epoque atmosphere of the hotel evoked by the paintings in the sitting room and the breakfast room. The breakfasts were delicious with a large variety of choices.  Best of all was the amazing staff. Everyone was so kind and helpful. No request was too difficult. I also loved talking with them after a day of sightseeing.  Upon leaving, I again…",5
2748,"Stayed for a week in June. Check in was quick and easy, reception staff very friendly. The room was basic, and clean. We found the beds comfortable. There are some toiletries in the bathroom - shower gel, shampoo etc. Shower worked well. The hairdryer wasn’t very effective.  There are also tea/coffee making facilities. The WiFi is free but intermittent. Our room had a small fridge which was really useful as it was unseasonably hot when we visited Berlin. The breakfast was amazing! So much choice, fresh bread, cheese, meats, cereal etc. Fresh coffee and hot water for teas, juices. The staff were constantly replenishing the supplies. The hotel is in a great area, lots of cheap eats and interesting bars within a few minutes walk. There is a Lidl about 5 minutes away. The U-Bahn…",4
2749,"Really the location is perfect it's really on the beach and in a perfect place, but unfortunately the rooms were very bad as the curtains there were very light and even there window was in glass so you couldn't sleep after the sun rise. also there was a bad smell coming from the bathroom all the time and the light there was very low that you couldn't see anything. also our room was on the pool so the noise there from the early morning was very bad that you couldn't enjoy a quiet stay with your partner. but also people there were very nice and helpful and they know how to treat the tourists. at the end may be I had bad luck considering the room but I can’t recommend this place to honeymooners or partners I can recommend it to families",3
2750,I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights - initialy I was allocated in a large standard room with a nice view. Upon check-in I was told that I am not entitled (not in line with T&C) to an upgrade as a gold member of Carlson Club even though superior rooms were available.  After one day I realised that the air-conditioning DOES NOT WORK! I was sweating all night and morning when the temperature outside reachd as much as 20*C! As for the record ther is no air-conditioning in the hotel but very noisy and inefective ventilation. I complained twice and next day I requested a new room. Receptionist apologized and gave me another room which I guess as a compensation was extra small! I don't really know if that room meets minimal requirements for 4* hotels in Latvia. To be honest I have…,2

Coffee and tea are served free of charge throughout the day in the reception area. The hotel is very friendly for families with children and the presents when you arrive is a nice surprise for the children. I recommend it for a pleasant and comfortable stay.",5
2752,"This was my first trip to Europe, or Berlin to be exact, so honestly I cannot compare with other hotels there but the overall experience staying at Motel One was great. It is not a luxury hotel, but nothing is missing: excellent location, nice clean rooms, good staff. You get endless options of places to check or hang out in within the walking distance.",4

2755,"Stayed here during my last Germany business trip. I usually stay at the Hilton Berlin, but was told by a colleague to try this place out. I wasn't disappointed as the rooms seem to have been recently updated with a clean and modern appeal. The TV can be larger. It was either a 36"" or 40"" flat screen. There is a commentary bottle of still water that gets replaced when you finish a bottle. The beds and pillows are comfy and the bathroom has your topical amenities.   If you decide to drive, there is an underground parking garage for €25/day. There's a full spread for the breakfast and two lounge areas to hang out at.  The hotel is walking distance from a shopping district, restaurants, the Tiergarten and the Germany Victory Column. ",4
2756,"The best part of the hotel is the location, it is quite central. The terrace on top is also nice. Very friendly service at the reception, but very slow service at breakfast (twice I had to carry other people's dirty dishes away in order to have a place to sit down for breakfast) and they ran out of some things and did not replace them. Rooms are ok, although some get some noise from something sounding like a motor.",3

2758,"I stayed in a street-view room for 2 nights, whilst on a business trip to Lisbon.  While the hotel's service was superb--everyone from the reception team, to housekeeping, to waitstaff was kind and willing to go out of their way to help--I was not impressed by the tired and under-maintained physical features of the hotel. My shower was missing a sliding door, the hinges crudely left to hang on the rail, which resulted in my flooding the bathroom floor after a short, 5-minute shower. The bathroom was also missing certain necessities, including glasses, but this seemed to be corrected by the second night of my stay. The bedboard and other furnishings appeared worn from overuse. I was also slightly frustrated at the lack of guest guide or any documentation on room/hotel amenities. …",3

No pool, and they apoligized that in the city they couldn't make that work... Upgrades put you on top level and 2 stories but many have NO view due to facade of original palace. yes, location as great, and view from our window was lovely, but restaurant was not ever busy, prices seemed high for the area, and bar was loevly but inactive.

The location was great, the area offered a lot to see and do, and as most of Portugal, the people were very…",3
2761,"The hotel is an architectural delight if you’re into art deco. Small lobby and long winding halls in red make you wanna call out ‘Red Rum’ like in The Shining. The renovated part has large rooms with free mini bar. The location is fantastic. My only observation is one would hope amenities in such a grand hotel would be more lively or the setting nicer. For example, breakfast is nothing special, the bar is sober, the lobby is small. Some housekeeping staff were somewhat rude and a full daily turnover and carpet cleaning were not performed. That’s my take.  ",3
2762,"This hotel felt very outdated to me- the location is great but hotel felt a little run down and dirty.  Upon arrival I was not assisted with my luggage- I had many bags as I was in the midst of a long business trip and had to drag my stuff in.  Check in took a long time, and once I got to the room I had two twin beds instead of a double or queen.  The bed also felt like a cot, it seemed really squeaky to me. The room was small and pretty unimpressive.  The furniture seemed worn out, and the locks on the room doors did not seem as secure as I would like.  There was more security up by the pool and the bar- they seemed very concerned about getting your room number for your drinks before even stepping foot near the pool. The hotel does have location going for it- right across the…",2
2763,I stayed at the property with my sister for my 30th Birthday celebration. From the moment we arrived I was disappointed. The customer service by staff was appalling. They appeared disinterested and were more worried about making coffees for each other and talking between themselves. The room was unclean and there was a stench coming from the bathroom. The overall cleanliness of the hotel was disappointing. There was food left in the hallway from room service- including a milk container for over 24 hours! I was very unimpressed and unhappy as I have stayed at multiple other Peppers properties and never been disappointed. ,2

2766,The motel was good value for money. The staff were friendly and breakfast was pretty good. The building was an old multistorey car park but you can't tell. Only downside was a fire alarm set off in the middle of the night. Really bad nights sleep.   ,4
2767,"Very clean, spacious and comfortable room/suite. The staff was very nice and accommodating. We booked through a famous hotel website but if you book directly on the hotel’s own website, you get a discount and complimentary breakfast. Convenient location—close to the subway (Metro) and a 15 min walk to the national and international train station. ",5
2768,"We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights, initially. We left to meet up with friends in Nice and loved the Crayon Rouge so much, we came back for another evening at the end of the week. The hotel was gorgeous, we had plenty of space, the room was impeccable, the staff was beyond friendly and accommodating. They gave us a smart phone to use round the city for maps and translation apps, etc (at no extra charge). Despite our efforts, our French was abysmal, however, the staff all appeared to be multilingual. Our second room was a bit small (still incredibly lovely), but we were in PARIS, the most incredible place on the planet- so we didn't waste a whole lot of time in the constructs of any one room or building. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone <3",5

Everything AND anything that I wanted to do as an American Tourist - who has been to Berlin about a dozen times - is a 5 to 10 minute walk away. Go out the front door, make a left, walk 40 yard. Go left on Rosenthaler Strasse and you're right in the party/restaurant area of Oraniensburger Strasse.   Which means you're about 300-400 yards from the Museum District. There are blue and white arrows mounted on street poles giving directions to landmarks/museums/districts/streets, or where ever it is you may want to go.

Would recommend if you are looking for a hotel in this area of Paris.",5

Across the street there’s a bakery plus tons of restaurants. Thursday morning they have farmers market, you can catch a little bit of everything. Rooms are small but modern but you will hear the subway 🚇 underneath plus the street traffic. Good price for the location and amenities. Au revouir ",5

However, until 2015 there is a buidling site (about the size of three soccer pitches!!) adjacent to the property.    Lovely staff and great service from all personnel.  Shame that the development outside has an enromous impact on overall experience. As soon as you leave the hotel you have to walk through a dark, long temporary road to get to the West Nanjing for restaurants/shopping.  Once the building site has gone, I would rate this as a 4 out of 5.",2

Everyone was always on computer and their personal devices, so even if you wanted to make an eye contact you could not and if you attempted staff acted irritated. Unbelievable. Room cleanliness was terrible. Bathroom was full of hair and coffee stains all over. I could not wait to check out. I wish I asked for a refund and checked out.

Personally, I don't think that room 18a should be offered to guests at all, it is simply not good enough. We contacted reception who were unable to put us in a double room but offered us one for the following day. They also pushed the twin beds together and made them up as a double bed.

2804,"When i booked the room on the net, I picked a room with  two queen beds because I was staying with my son for a guys night in the city (Second City was great!) .  But I erroneously picked a handicap accessible room.  Apparently, the hotel sticks poor handicap folks on the third floor overlooking a busy Illinois avenue and a fire station.  When I first got to the room, I immediately texted the front desk (I like the texting feature BTW) and asked for a new room.  Their first response was that I picked a handicap room (so, I guess, too bad). Then I explained that I made a mistake and they said ""well there are no other rooms with two queen beds available.""  They offered up a white noise machine.  I said ok and they responded they would send one up immediately.  The machine never…",1

2806,"Bit of a late review as I travelled here a few months ago, As far as the hotel goes, Lovely! the hotel is modern, Stylish, Beds are very comfortable, and Location is amazing, In a touristy area so felt very safe to go out and about even at Night, close to lots of shops, bars and resturaunts, and close to the tube station making it very easy to travel round and see everything, The hotel staff were very friendly and very helpful, full of knowledge and tips for the best way and times to get to the attractions, As far as Berlin goes, It's not my most favourite destination I've been to but still a good experience and it was nice to see the brandenburg gate, and if travelling at the end of the year the christmas markets are a fantastic experience and well worth visiting, they are…",4
2807,"We liked the fact that this is an apartotel and each room has a small kitchen area and our room was large with a small balcony and a big walk-in shower.  Lux 11 is located close to the Television Tower which is close to good transport connections, restaurants and shopping.  The breakfast was excellent.  Freshly cooked eggs any way you like, good coffee, a selection of cheeses, meats and smoked salmon, pastries etc.  We would definitely recommend this as a great place to stay in Berlin.",4

2809,"Leaking lavatory pan, non working light it is enough to say that it is not superior 4 star hotel as advertised. Upgrade to superior room was very expensive. Avoid standart rooms, cause they are  in separated wing and you will feel continuos vibration from the street traffic all the time. Double bed on wheels is definetly not for a couple )",2
2810,In this hotel we were for a few days and without any reservation we found a room in July. It is quite place not far from the center of fun on the island. In front of hotel there is nice and clean pool but behind the rooms there is same view on see and bushes like twenty years ago. Near the hotel there is cheap rent-a-bike and that is all you need for a beautiful island 20 km long. ,3
2811,"The hotel is just about average. As a Marriott gold member, I didn't get free breakfast at the hotel, the reason is that this hotel is not a full Marriott Hotel (something like that). There is no room service and staffs are just about the average. The location is convinent. It is close to the soccer stadium and train station, it takes about 15 mins to get to the city center (central station).",3
2812,"I have stayed for two weeks in this hotel. Its nice and near to public transportation. I liked the quietness in the area and at a 5-8 minutes distance from crowded central.  Breakfast is good and choices are fine.   Some of the staff members weren’t found of much help, I won’t name them or give details of how they were not helpful.  Overall the hotel is nice.  If I have to change anything in the hotel I would first change the entrance. For the first time visitors it’s difficult to figure out. ",3
2813,"This hotel definitely needs a refurbisment. In hallway of 11th floor wall paper comes of and the carpet was dirty. Obviously somebody lost a  part of breakfast / snack on his way to his room. Room was OK, but  not super tidy. Bathroom was big & clean, but needs  an makeover. Receptionists do their utmost but some of them are very poor with English, so you have to explain 2 to 3 times to make clear what you want. Do not forget to write your destination in Chinese when you want to take a taxi. ( Ask a reception - desk)",2

2816,"So this was a last minute trip to Barcelona for the 1st time and we picked this hotel after reading all the great reviews.

2818,"Its not so much the filth (dirty bathroom floor) that was shocking (any underpaid cleaning person can overlook a spot or two), but to have the front desk help tell you that your eyes are playing tricks on you or that it must be a mirage because our rooms are ""inspected"" by by a supervisor is beyond absurd!  We simply asked could they send someone up to mop or tidy up the bathroom (that we had not yet used and wondered what was the shiny yellow splash droppings surrounding the toilet area and next to the shower entry).  It was 9:00 p.m. and the front desk help rudely informed us that housekeeping in gone for the day.  We said well can you send maintenance, he said ""there is none.""

At the top of the hill there is 1 small shop for snacks, juice, water and stuff and 1 restaurant. Down to the beach to the left there is 2 more restaurants and a scuba School but that's it. When you get bored of them then the options are 15 min hike yes hike to a row of 1 shop and 6 restaurants or 10 bus trip to the next town up the hill. Or 30 min hotel bus to funchal very limited spaces or public bus 1 hr. Staff are nice and overall hotel is nice. I would recommend 7 nights at most as entertainment is poor. 14 nights was just too much with nothing to do. Overall pleasant enough stay and the island itself is…",3
2820,I arrived late and received an email confirming how to check in. The visit did not open when the key was taken. I called the manager and didn't go in for an hour before the visit. One of the first guests came in because it locked the door. It was very hard not to give this attention to the same room guests. Urticaria began to develop when bedding was dusty and when it was in bed. My body was itchy so hard. And the ladder that goes up the second floor is made of steel and the feet are so painful.,1
2821,"The best thing about the Pensao Grande Oceano is the price: for a mere 20 euros a night (in the off-season) I was provided with a private room (complete with full-sized bed) AND private washroom.  This was THE best deal I encountered during my recent journey through Europe.  My room, though old, was clean and well-kept, and the hotel was only a short walk from Porto's main plaza and more importantly, from its downtown train station.  The staff and I had a bit of trouble communicating, but we got on in a mix of Spanish and Portugese, which was a great deal of fun!   Some people might have been bothered by the noise (street activity and church bells) late at night and/or early in the morning, but this doesn't bother me.  My main concerns were a) that the small street on which the…",3

It's a strict minimum, but croissants were very good to sum up, a superb place but almost no services",2
2823,"Chose the Adlon Kempinski after looking at a number of different options and couldn't have been happier with our choice. From our greeting on arrival to the day we left the staff at the Adlon were everything you would expect from a quality hotel and more. The hotel itself is very special - beautifully appointed rooms which we almost had to drag ourselves out of to get out into Berlin! The hotel facilities and famous breakfast were first class too.  The location overlooking the Brandenburg Gate is perfect for exploring Berlin. Will certainly be returning to the Adlon, hopefully very soon.",5
2824,Hotel is good... However its a fair walk to the metro. Around 1 km or more. Breakfast was OK.... Very basic and very the same. Room was fine... Tiny TV in room. A room tax of one euro per person per night needs to be paid. ,3
2825,"Resort is well laid out and looks very lovely. However, service wise, its below even average. Staff don't seem to know what they are doing and a manager wasn't to be seen in my 4 nights here. Wifi never worked anywhere in the resort. Breakfast coffee was killer coffee.  The restaurant at poolside has 35 kg chairs, you just cant move them. Its not Terracotta but pure granite if you ask me",2

2828,"One day and one night at the Cavendish Hotel was the highlight of our 12 day trip!  The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly.  They offered us a glass of Rose when we arrived and all their dining recommendations were perfect.  The room had everything one needed, plus an amazing view.  Finally, the beach club they partner with provided a very reasonably priced option for enjoying a full day under the sun.   We can't wait to come back, but will definitely make our stay longer!",5
2829,"Situated out of town but really easy public transport into the city centre. We chose to get a 4 day travel card for €21.50 which we brought from reception and we used trams and buses for it, well worth the money. The hotel is ok, welcome and information from reception could have been better, they didn't even explain to us how to get to our room. We chose to include breakfast when booking as it was €10 per person per day otherwise, and I'm glad we did include it as it wasn't worth €10! Not very many hot options, and the quality of the food wasn't very good. Staff were continuously on their mobile phones and talking loudly between themselves which isn't very professional. The room was of an ok standard, bit tired, but I've stayed in worse! The shower kept flooding so it was knee…",3

In pictures seems the beach is behind the hotel but is not true...is near,but you must walk across some fields with abandoned cars and half-built houses.... Breakfast is not very good.... in my opinion needs more care on the instalations and new bathrooms in the rooms to get the category expected.   ",3
2834,"Breakfast was very goodThe room was tidy, the heating was fast , and there was everything needed + there was the possibility to do by yourself tea/coffee directly in our private room (!)The two girls at the reception were very gentle and nice, NOT nice the old man though.(at the reception).",5

2837,"In general the hotel staff are quite arrogant, making guests wait. The concierge was a huge disappointment recommending the worst driver we have used in our seven visits to Mendoza. The reception staff will just ignore the guests  The rooms do not meet the standards one expects from Intercontinental hotels. There was no water, Kleenex, coffee, iron in room. Housekeeping was simply incompetent. We had to call twice for towels and shampoo and the shower floor was moldy and not cleaned properly.   The hotel is located away from the town center so the location is not good.  On the whole one gets the impression of a hotel in decline with very poor management.   On the positive side, the breakfast was generally good.  We will not be returning and cannot recommend the hotel.",2
2838,"I called the hotel the night before we left for our ORD flight. I asked what time the shuttle bus picked up at ORD. I was told, ""just give us a call and we'll come pick you up"". When we arrived at ORD I called and was told the shuttle picks up only 2x/hour. It would have been nice to know this ahead of time so we did not rush to the shuttle bus area. We waited 20 minutes and were the only one to board the mini van. This was my first sign of things to come.  The van driver was very chatty. However, I do not think it is appropriate to talk about the female staff at Hooters when Traveling with my elderly father.  The front desk staff was robotic at check in. Very unfriendly.

On the one hand, the beach and the resort are beautiful, but on the other hand, the staff and management really need to make an effort to improve the customer experience.    THE BEACH: The most beautiful beach we have seen in Vietnam. The sand is white and fine, the water is pristine clear and calm and the setting is spectacular (a lagoon with shallow water and corals, perfect for snorkelling or diving). We saw a few pieces of plastic and bottles floating in the water when we were swimming, but it was nothing compared to the other unmaintained beaches nearby. We understand the staff here do their best to keep the beach clean.    THE BUNGALOWS : Scattered along the beach, the bungalows are simple and rustic, and also very charming and comfortable.  We liked…",2

I felt home since the first minute and wished I could stay longer with such nice thoughtful people. Definitely my favorite hotel in Paris",5

Room smelt musty and mouldy, shower didn't work properly. Air conditioner in rooms was lacking the ability to cool down the room and the public corridors were hot and stuffy. The buffet breakfast was not worth our time, many dishes were cold and/or empty with customers scraping the last remnants of food from the serving plates.  Juice canisters were empty or broken and there was still an hours worth of service to go.  Unfortunately everything about this hotel was tacky. I would not go back to the Green Hotel when for the same price and within 5kms you can get clean, comfortable rooms and fantastic service elsewhere.",2

It doesn't feel like the typical 4* hotel - where you feel ashamed to walk in wearing jeans you're sure the staff are judging everything you do. All the staff we met at the Dormero were bright, cheerful and friendly, without it ever feeling forced (or false). The rooms are well sized and well appointed with a free mini-bar (containing beer, juice , water and cola) and a massive TV with a wide range of channels and films.

Turns out the guy running the hotel manages several other properties at the same time...so if you don't happen to catch him at the right time you might just have to wait 30 minutes for someone to open the front door.  The apartments left me feeling a bit mixed.  Finger prints, scuff marks and damage scattered the walls throughout the apartment.  The furnishings were also damaged and stained.  That said, the apartment is large and well positioned in the city.  Full kitchen, laundry machine in the apartment...weather forecasts and pillow menues were all pretty nice touches.

One night is OK, but it´s really noisy during the day time, as there is a big road right in front of it.  The bathroom in the rooms is so small and my door could not even close properly, so all the smell from the toillet came inside the room.  No gym. no swimmingpool.. for one night and if you have to catch an airplane the next day or a train, OK, but not to stay in Shanghai.

The elevator has a stupid system that stops in every floor and the other 3 elevators are waiting for our nerves to go crazy. First time it took me 10 minutes to go from floor 21 to ground level.

The room itself was comfortable - but had curtains everywhere and were used as wardrobe doors; door to the bathroom and to cover the glass wall that looked into the bathroom.   As a lady, trying to put your makeup on was a challenge as the mirrors in the room were all smokey brown.   The shower was over the bath which usually wouldn't be a problem.  however the bath was placed in this glass box so it was quite a wide stretch to get into the bath, with the shower screen making it difficult to also turn sideways.

Staff at the residence club is a let down, they acknowledged and subsequently ignored all our requests.

The lobby, elevators and outdoor area was clean enough, but not what you would expect for a hotel of that cost in that location. Cleaning product fragrance was intense, made elevator rides uncomfortable. Not good value for money. After we voiced our concerns, we were upgraded to a larger room which was better, but still not as clean as what should be expected. At that point, we wanted to leave, but as they keep a deposit for last minute cancelations, it wasn't worth the hassle or the cost.

And then again an hour later! We should have used the do not disturb sign.   Couple of things that would help:   Bring a kettle. Although the picture on booking.com showed a kettle in the room, there wasn't one. Fortunately we had a travel kettle with us.   Bring earplugs. It said soundproofed.

2863,"All in all a fantastic place to stay in Berlin. The room (Superior double)  was large, airy and very clean. The bed was huge and extremely comfortable. The rooms overlook a charming central courtyard so there was no road noise. The air conditioning was effective and quiet.

The hotel also sits on top of a subway station which makes it easy to get anywhere you need to go   I highly recommend getting a rate with breakfast included. The buffet was huge with something for everyone. The food and drink was really first class.   The staff were  friendly and extremely accommodating.

To say the least,  I had to remind her that I booked a suite with an Ocean view. After a few frustrating hours my travel agency booked me at a better hotel. Don't waste your money and book at the Beacon. The service is awful and the staff is poorly trained.",1

There were no ""amenities"" to speak of which is surprising considering the price. There was mildew in the shower, peeling wall paper, light but noticeable stains on the bedding, the fan in the bathroom did not work, and the lock to the very expensive items in the refrigerator was broken.

2872,"Stayed again at Lindemann's two and a half years later. It remains uniformly excellent and represents outstanding value for money. In 2013, the hotel felt crisp and new. It still does. The staff and management appear to take great pride in their hotel and work on the visitor's behalf. They are welcoming and friendly and smile a lot! Rooms are fine, the bar has sensible prices and the breakfast is a highlight, but staff make it what it is. Sure to return again in the future",5
2873,"This is a very minimalistic hotel. It´s quite new, so the rooms are fresh but simple. The location is OK. Go for a quick walk down Leipziger Strasse and will see Friedrichstrasse in 10 minutes.   You will also find Topographie des Terrors och Checkpoint Charlie in walking distance from the Hotel.  You can get a double room for 80€!  Enjoy",4

2876,"We were given room which opened out in sit out garden. Room was big with four beds , we had asked for double bed room but was given a family room . We are fortunate to meet the previous owner and present . Small hotel good for value . Bit far from city center but close to Vangoha Museum Local transport in Amsterdam is very good so the distance does not matter much. This hotel needs to improve a bit.",3
2877,"Our room was filled with small bugs, dirty sheets that had large blood stains on them and a lot of hairs and pubes (different sizes and all) I truly am worried they never cleaned the sheet for multiple stays from past guests. The front desk was rude and unsympathetic. This hotel is run down and the rooms are beat up. Chipped paint, musty smell, dirt carpet and the bathrooms are absolutely grimey and gross. This hotel should more so be called a motel. The only luxury here is the location and the closeness to the beach. But this hotel needs a major remodel, friendly staff, and a better cleaning crew. I never once stayed in such a dirty room.",1
2878,"The hotel looks new but my room's amenities looks downgraded especially bathroom products. The staff's English in general are bad, they even didn't fully catch what I mean and I had to repeated several times. My overall feeling at the hotel is unfriendliness from the staff.",2
2879,Currently staying here for business and have had very frustrating time with the wifi and the  phones in my room.  Staff did try and help (after glacial look from the front desk) but they didn't understand and phones (after 3 tries) 'worked' they smiled and said it was fixed but went back to not working the next phone call that came in.  WIFI is extremely slow and drops connections constantly.  They say there's nothing wrong with it.  Wouldn't mind so much but you have to PAY for this! Similar complaints about the toilet not flushing well (on the 16th floor) and small bathrooms - no counter space or underneath for storing stuff. Overall very disappointed.,2
2880,The hotel was a great place to stay. The location was incredible - easy walk to a main u and s station and just one stop from many main attractions. It was very clean and the staff was all friendly. Only downside is that the bathrooms were small and gave the feel of a cruise ship the way they were setup. ,4
2881,"I have never written a review for anything, but my experience at the W Chicago City Center was so bad that I am for the first time now.   We booked two rooms for the past weekend over the phone with someone at the front desk who told us we were all set for the weekend.We called back to confirm the day before we arrived and found they had messed up the reservation and after speaking to them for an hour everything seemed to be fixed. When we got there, however, they had again booked us the wrong rooms so that we did not have enough beds for the amount of people in our group. When we asked the front desk person, Nellie, what could be done to fix the issue she just repeated loudly ""We. don't. have. any. rooms. with. two. beds."" She continued to speak to us like we were children,…",1
2882,"This is a wonderful hotel as many have noted. I’ll focus my review on outliers. The hotel is new and clean everywhere both common areas and the rooms. Speaking of rooms, do not expect a lot of space. Think NYC size hotel rooms. The breakfast area is massive with ample seating for all. The breakfast itself is far above a normal Hampton Inn breakfast in the U.S. It is full buffet with nearly endless selections more akin to what you would expect at a full-service Hilton, Marriott, Hyatt or Intercontinental except for the fact that it’s free. I’ve stayed at many hotels where a comparable breakfast costs $30 usd and isn’t nearly as good.",5
2883,Lovely open check-in area with bar to one side.  Very clean hotel in all areas.  The rooms are pleasant and the beds comfortable but rather warm even with the heating off.  Breakfast is expensive but there is a very good choice of buffet.  The only gripe with breakfast was a 20 min wait for an omelette as the chef had disappeared!   The hotel is near to bus routes and there are several restaurants within walking distance.  I would stay here again.,4

There is nothing special about it. I checked in early (11am) and was given a room on 11th floor overlooking the Expo and the river. I found the room to be cosy and simple.  One part of it (where the bed is) seemed ok with nice arm chair and the wall painted in red. The other part however needs urgent upgrade. The furniture and especially the cupboard are ugly and old and do not fit into nowdays traveller's needs. Tv and Tv chanells were very good. Bed was also comfortable but the linen seemed half plastic. The bathroom very standard with basic ameneties. I liked the bathtub glass wall instead of currtain…",3

Also, you can walk to the site of Akrotiri, and go a bit longer and you are at Red Beach, which is gorgeous! The bad: The lady working there seemed very ornery. She seemed put out when we asked for help. Also, there are so many rules! There are rules for what you can and can't do in the bathroom, there is a huge list of rules for being near the pool. For example, you can't eat any kind of food at the tables near the pool unless you bought it from them, and you can't use room towels near the pool, only your own. Also, the wifi was pretty hit and miss. It seemed to only work in our room if you were right by the door. All in all, I…",3
2887,"This is not a 5 star hotel. The service is lacking and housekeeping is unreliable (I never knew how my room would be made up each day). I had to ask for a hair dryer from reception which was later installed in my room (apparently not enough in the hotel for all guests). The toilet was running water constantly and I was ringing to have it fixed the entire week I was there. Although newly renovated, the hand towels hang directly over the toilet (unsanitary). The internet connection was unreliable within the room and I was only allowed 250K per day of surfing - not enough for downloading work emails - then was dropped until the next day.   Although a beautiful location next to the beach, the smell outside the hotel was terrible. The sewer from the flavelas on the hill ran down in…",2

2889,"I actually liked this place, except for one thing, the pervasive cigarette smoke.  I had the corner garden room, which is small, but I really liked it. Cozy, slept well, though I was woken at just before 8AM most mornings by the cleaning lady cleaning outside. I think they could let her start doing that later, maybe at 9 AM.   The bathroom is good, as well. I liked the skylight. Staff was friendly. WiFi did not work at all well in my room, which I would not have minded, as there is a lovely garden where you can go and work and where the WiFi worked. However, my big problem, was the smoking in the garden. Practically every time I went out, somebody, whether guest or staff, was smoking in that garden. So, I couldn't go sit there to get my WiFi, and the smell even blew in to the…",3
2890,"Seven friends stayed here in three twin and one single room for a birthday weekend in Paris.  The area was recommended and now I can see why, so easy to get everywhere but also away from the tourist trap.  Close to Republique metro but also the Canal St Martin with its lovely bars, also very easy to walk into the Marais. The rooms were very clean, staff extremely helpful and great value.  I'd highly recommend if you're on a budget and happy with a three star hotel as extremely reasonable and in a great location.",5
2891,"We stayed here for three nights. We cannot compliment the hotel or staff enough. The breakfast was great. The free afternoon tea and free bar 18:00-20:00 were added bonuses. The bar was a good opportunity to speak to fellow residents and Raoul is fantastic. The owner also takes an active interest and speak to each guest at breakfast on Monday. Whilst not on the sea front the location is excellent. It is a 2 minute walk to the train station, 5 minute walk from la Croisette and 6-7 minute walk from Hotel de Ville (where the airport bus will drop you - going back get it from the train station). We so enjoyed the hotel we are already planning our return visit next year.",5
2892,"I stayed here for one night Ina business trip and was given room 201. It was a small room round the back of the hotel with almost no natural light and some engine running 24hrs a day. So if you want somewhere quiet with a view, this is not the place. Otherwise, breakfast was simple but plentiful with a great view of the beach. Also, I did not manage to connect to the wifi, so there must have been some problem.",2

MAin drawback: the place is not run by  professional hotel-staff! The place clearly lacks at all places a firm hand of an experienced maitre d'hotel. Already the check-in was a pain. Three girls, more busy to pick up the phone: ""how can I help you?"", then helping the clients standing right before them. Friendly, yes, but not at all useful. CHeck in took long, the rooms were not ready, the simple questions which metro to take, lead to confusion etc. Only after four (!) times asking, it turned out that indeed they do sell public transport cards. The rooms: yes, they have been designed nicely in boutique…",3

The buffet breakfast had a very good selection. There is also a good selection of restaurants nearby.",4

First words were we will fix it in 1 hour, next was = during today, next = maybe tomorrow and all next days = maybe tomorrow we will fix it. I need to work - I cannot survive without WWW connection here. Internet is available only on reception (is it really so hard to replicate internet withing access points from uplink going directly to reception router ? I dont think so, 3 mins and this is done).

Staff were very helpful and made some great recommendations for tours. I'd stay here again!,4

They are a small boutique-y hotel (I think there are 29 rooms?) and the location really can't be beat. It's between the Croisette and Rue d'Antibes, hidden amongst the other big hotels. It's a quick 5 minute walk from the train station in Cannes and a 5-7 minute walk from the airport express bus stop.   They have recently updated the rooms and it definitely shows.

But as in many design hotel, interior designers should have spent at least one night in the room to notice some really big problems: - rooms facing the street are extremely noisy (the old charming windows are too thin to protect from the street noise) - lighting are superb, but not sufficient in the bathroom (eg. no lamp on top of the mirror, so shaving was hazardous). The two bedside lamps can be switched off only from one side of the bed (and not independently, so either both of you sleep, or read!) - the fancy bath tub in the shower (yes!) is great, but very hard to access without some gymnastic!

The hotel is beautifully decorated and there is a bar and breakfast area downstairs. The rooms could have been larger but this wasn’t a problem for us personally. The beds and pillows were comfortable and the shower worked well.  The hotel is located in a quiet part of the city, although on a main road. However, we found the room to be noise proof and we did not hear any traffic. There are good transport links nearby, with bus stops on the street.

The hotel is modern and clean and quiet.  The rooftop deck area is a great place to relax, with snacks, a bar, a small dipping pool, and a modest view.

The fan for the heater was extremely annoying sounding throughout the night...even my husband was annoyed and he generally likes the sound of a fan to sleep.

It was a one night stay and that amount cleared my account some time ago yet this unknown $83 lingers!! After multiple attempts to get ahold of the office by phone, and no one answering the phone, I called Wyndham Rewards to discuss the issue. They put me through to a live person at the hotel office.

The pools are not heated at all- they look beautiful but the water is freezing. Not sure why we booked a room with a pool that cannot be used at all and not one pool in the whole resort is heated to take the chill off the cold water- very disappointed as I booked this resort for swimming. I understand it is winter but the resort should ensure that the pools can be used by the guests. One daughter swam in the freezing water at the commencement of the stay and is now sick with a cold. Should be compensated or refunded part of the room costs as we were not able to use the pools that was the main reason we…,2

We confirmed with the lady helping us that at 4pm our room with requested king bed would be ready. So we changed and went to the beach and left our bags with concierge. At 3pm we received a text that our room was ready. After getting our keys we proceeded to the versailles tower, passing a ton of rowdy scantily clothed women and guys who reeked of weed following.

No telling what could have crawled out. Could hear doors slamming and noise from other rooms ALL night long.

This is a property that charges high rates for an old hotel because get stuck at O’Hare and they are desperate or decide it’s just easier.

Fruit really nice though. Staff in restaurant not interested in the guests - more interested in talking to each other rather helping people to find tables, no welcome or interaction with guests.

The photo showed hammocks on the balcony but when we arrived, there was neither a hammock or even a chair to enjoy the gorgeous river views.  For around $40US a night, the walls on the bungalow did not meet the roof so it was quite cool at night (we visited in December; the mosquitoes would be a nightmare in summer).  The bungalow itself was extremely basic, not what I expected for the price. The hot water lasted 3 mins at the most, and there was no lock on the bungalow, only a small padlock for the gate which could easily be stepped around.

For reasons hard to fathom, this large hotel with many guests has small lifts - with your luggage only 4. So, with conference bookings with large delegations you have to plan that it will take a long time for people to gather in the lobby. Now I am not one who criticises the staff but the management - on arrival, with many guests coming in they have one trainee only: not good enough. Now most hotels have staff who…",3
2929,Although not resident of the hotel my family have a holiday apartment nearby and always find the reception staff extremely helpful and courteous. We visited the restaurant for a meal and the staff and quality of food was first class! Also excellent value for money. We will return!,5

2932,"Lovely welcome at reception, forgot the guys name, but you won The Eurovision Song contest that night so you'd remember!  He spoke English so well and gave us lots of tips and advice.  The hotel was decorated beautifully and very clean and tidy.  I was just really dissapointed by the superior double room which I had booked and was not made aware that the small  room and bathroom are quite open plan.  So much that the bedside table would be splashed by the shower! If you like your privacy, book somewhere else.  There was no storage for clothes, just a small hanging space and nowhere to put your case when not in use, so just left it open on the desk/dressing table.  We could open our window slightly to see a view of the side street.  ( room 312) I did email the hotel before…",3
2933,"It pains me to give this hotel even 1 star! If Shore Club is trying to be shabby chic, it fails miserably, cause it's just plain shabby!  No amount of putrid toxic scent, pounding music, and laundry hanging in the lobby can improve one's impression of this tired, dank property.  And then there is the pretentious front desk staff, who are as cold as ice, painfully (intentionally???) slow, and who repeat everything over and over in a robotic drone until you give up trying to make your point. Things started off and ended badly at shabby Shore Club. The first night my friend was given a matchbox room, instead of the suite he had reserved. It was a battle with management from the outset. He was obliged to pay more for the suite to which he was ostensibly ""upgraded"" and which still…",1
2934,As we wanted to visit Disney Shanghai for 2 days we booked a studio and a room at this Novotel as it is conveniently located very close to Disneyland Shanghai. We were 2 mums traveling with 5 children aged 4 to 14 years. The good surprise is that the hotel offers free shuttle on a regular basis to and from the park during the day! The rooms are spacious and well furnished. Our studio was in an inner courtyard and was lacking light though. The breakfast was a terrible experience. They have no management whatsoever. The sitting arrangement is not managed. When we arrived no tables were available (we were 7 people). A lot of parties of 2 or 1 were sitting at large tables. So when you arrive with a large group you have to split in 3 or 4 groups to sit at tables for 2 (Which is not…,2
2935,"Every now and again you stay in a hotel which becomes the victim of its own reviews. This hotel is such a place. By this, I mean the rose tinted glasses of some reviewers who are serial users of this hotel may paint too rosy a picture of the place. It is perhaps pertinent for anyone considering booking this hotel to read the reviews under ""Average"" as well as those under 5* only then will you be able to make an informed choice for yourself and your own circumstances.  It is true this hotel excels in many ways, but like all things in life it cannot be perfect.   Location-  This is a biggie. The hotel is on a steep hill, and for anyone who feels they can easily walk to town - think again. It is not an easy journey, there is no foot path for much of the route and part of it is on a…",3
2936,"Quick business trip hotel, first pleased by reasonable size of rooms, but quickly noticed a pervasive murky moldy smell throughout the building. And indeed you find water damage in many places (Aircon, pipe system, etc.) even in the floor lobbies across multiple floors (see pictures). In the bathroom and shower beside water damage also black mold all over. Maintenance poor (e.g. broken lamps hanging from ceiling). Breakfast below average, friendliness of staff is good, WiFi also. But hygiene and cleanliness should not depend on how many stars the hotel has, hence a poor rating is justified.",2
2937,"After staying here a number of times since my last review in 2018, the Hilton Berlin is still our 'Home' in Berlin.  The rooms and hotel are always very clean and the staff are very friendly and accommodating. The Executive Lounge is one of the best in the Hilton portfolio.  2019 was our first year being Hilton Honours Diamond members and this has only made something already great, even better.  I even took my Dad, Aunt and Uncle to Berlin and they loved the hotel also.  It's a great central location and we mostly walk everywhere while in the city.",5
2938,"I am a seasoned traveling, staying is places around the world.  This was by far one of, if not the worst ever.  The pictures on the web are NOTHING like the hotel.  There is no comfortable lobby. You are directed to the 19th floor.  Getting off the elevator every other hall light is off.  You walk to a small wooden desk with a person in a hoodie with a composition notebook in front of him taking your reservation.  It just gets worse from there.  Room has blinds falling down and non functional.  Kitchen area a mess.  Carpet is filthy.  I was in the room for 5 min.  Took pictures of the mess, left and went to another hotel.  Do not stay here.",1

They were always on hand to assist whenever we needed anything and despite our limited command in French, they were the best. We will return to the Ruc Hotel for Midem 2018 and many more to come.",5
2941,"Most reviews are right: this is a nice little hotel and a great location! Yet, there is no ventilation, no bathroom door, and a air condition system that spreads the bathroom smells throughout the room. Bu hey, if none of these issues matter to you, then it is a great place to stay!   My husband and I stayed at the Orchard (not Orchard Garden) a few years back. We were exited to return to the hotel and got a great deal at the Orchard Garden.   The problems started after resting a few hours in the room: inadequate ventilation and poor air quality. First, the windows are plugged (presumably according to California law) and there is a tiny vent underneath the window, but this is not nearly enough for fresh air. I complained about the air quality and was advised that it could be…",1
2942,"Conveniently located inexpensive hotel in a quiet neighborhood. Friendly reception. Relatively big room with a coffee machine. Good restaurants around (from what we tried I would  recommend ""Berliner Kafeerosterei"" for coffee&cakes and ""La Piano"" for steacks). Convenient beds. Bathroom a little bit small - for one person at a time. All in all - very good deal for the price.",4

2944,"Wonderful boutique hotel and location.   2 minute walk from Vavin station, which has amazing restaurants. We walked from the hotel to the Notre Dame, Eiffel Tower, The Lourve, Av. des Champs-Élysées, everywhere in about 40 minutes (max) and the routes are very scenic and quiet . You come across some amazing boutique shops and restaurants, patisseries en route.  The hotel itself was extremely clean and well looked after. Amazing decor and the beds were so comfortable!!  I would highly recommend for a central Paris break, the neighborhood felt safe and prestigious, loads of local people and great french food, especially seafood.  Thanks for an amazing stay!",5
2945,"Really not a good choice for our long weekend. The first room smelled like smoke--like someone was lighting up in the next room. The very nice staff shifted me to a different room prior to my family arriving by separate car (to meet me at the end of a business trip). That room was marginally better but still smelled awful. The rooms were antiquated, stale, and smelly. The door to the room didn't close unless we stood there and pulled/pushed it closed. The location was quite out of the way and not sure I would call it truly downtown at all. Not sure what one could walk to if one really wanted to stroll in that neighborhood. Don't say I didn't warn you. Just find another location.",1
2946,"Firstly I would like to say that the staff were very friendly. However over the 10 days we were there we had a number of issues that could have in my opinion been easily sorted but weren’t.   1 Our hot water didn’t work very well when we complained we were informed that the water was from a tank and there was nothing they could do. Our water was not hot after having 1 shower during the second shower the water became cold. As a couple we did need to use the shower twice and it ended up that one of us would always need to have a cold shower.   2 On day two of our holiday our toaster broke. We informed the reception and gave them the broken appliance, we were informed they would get us an replacement. After asking about this daily, day 10 of our holiday came along and alas still no…",3
2947,I visit this hotel twice a year staying in an apartment and find the place  suits my needs. The staff are like a family and always greet me with a smile which makes returning pleasurable. There are a few little annoying things that never seem to improve. One is the Aircon/ heating whether I stay on the 3 rd or 5 the floor it seems ineffectual.Over the years I have used the restuarant a few times but have found better locally and certainly better value. This year I chose to eat dinner on the Madiera night and was bitterly disappointed.I have eaten scabbard fish many times in various restuarants but it has always been filleted but here it was not and so full of bones including the main backbone. That and the fact it was cold just like the sweet potato and maize suggest a regime…,3
2948,"Great location but not up to Four Seasons standard.  Housekeeping need a lot of work on the service part, like replacing product and cleaning and replacing glass ware. Shower had no water pressure and tub could not hold a bath! Attended a wedding on the lawn on the waterfront and it was spectacular. I would say the food and catering department was very good.",2
2949,"This hotel works well if you have a car with you. I found a free parking space overnight for free. Not sure if it costs during the day. About 30 minutes drive to Schoenefeld Airport. Not far on the U-Bahn/ S-Bahn to the centre. Breakfast is a bit expensive at €16-18 per person. Beside the S-Bahn station and shopping mall there is a very nice takeaway bakery where you can get a really nice breakfast and carry it 5 minutes walk back to the hotel room.   Buy an all day ticket when arriving at the airport and you get 24 hours unlimited travel on all buses, trams, U-Bahn and S-Bahn for really good value. ",4
2950,"My daughter and I stayed here for a week in early July and we had a very nice stay. The room and bathroom were small, of course, but the location, the helpfulness of the staff, and the comfort of the hotel were great. We’ll definitely be back. My only caveat is that the airport shuttle company whose placard is at the front desk did not show up for our ride back to CDG, so I wouldn’t recommend them (obviously not the Hotel Turenne’s fault).

2951,"Two of us stayed here for 4 nights last week for a birthday present of mine. When we arrived we were greeted by name and shown to our room by the owner. He also helped advise us on places to visit and restaurants to try. Although his English was limited he tried his very hardest to keep us happy at all times!   We were greeted every time we returned to the hotel, we always felt very welcome and we knew that anything we needed they would help with. Breakfast was lovely, out on the sunny terrace. You have a wide space of time to go down to east which is very handy. It included of croissants, baguette, yoghurt, selection of jams & spreads, freshly squeezed orange juice and a hot drink of your choice.   On our last morning we had to leave before breakfast time but the owner insisted…",5

Our room was pretty spacious, had a nice bathroom and good air conditioning, which in Barcelona in the spring/summer is a must! The window in our room was like French doors that opened with just a step out little balcony to look out of. The black out curtains and sound proofing made for a good nights sleep. There is a nice breakfast room with a good breakfast that you can either add to your accommodation price or pay for when you use it. We had breakfast there one day and there was a nice selection of fruits, meats, cheeses, cereals, juices etc etc. I think it was 10 euro each to add this…",4

The (very small) staff were helpful and pleasant and we were surprised that the receptionist also doubled up as waitress for the breakfast service. Breakfast was quite good - selection of breads and cakes, fresh fruits and eggs, bacon etc. Our suite was in need of some TLC and had not been cleaned to a very high standard - there was dust and hair on the floors when we arrived and it remained there during our entire stay. The bed linen, however, was immaculately clean. Supplies of shampoo and shower gel were not re-stocked after our second night. The hotel is housed in a re-furbished building but the adjoining…",3

I know it’s crazy !!! And it’s 20 € for a day which is not bad but we wanted to use sauna after hiking all day at 7pm and the lady still wanted to charge us for the full day she wouldn’t  even let us pay for an hour. Where I come from they would just say go ahead  it’s only 1h or she would charge us for 1h only. 4- our room was on the 6 floor and I tell you we had to take two elevators and walk for 5 min to get to our room . 5-its about 40 min drive from Funchal   ",3

It is hard to find family rooms in Paris so we got a double and a triple.  We did not eat breakfast.  It is 12 euros.  Rue Cler Street has the perfect fruit markets and cafes at your fingertips.  This is the very best street to stay in Paris.  And you literally come out of the hotel with all the amenities that you need.  Also there is a laundrymat within 1-2 min walk.  Eiffel Tower is a 10 min walk, Subway within 5 min walk.  I love it here! I will be back.",5

Cleaning staff left door unlocked the entire day after cleaning. The room only has one light switch that turns on 4 very bright spots. I dont think a small lamp next to the bed is too much to be asked for when reading at night.   pro: scooter rental in the hotel, hotel located fairly close to the restaurant strip by the river and the beach.

2967,Enjoyed the hip vibe of the neighborhood relatively near Alexanderplatz.   Staff very friendly and helpful.   Room very clean and spacious (we took the penthouse).  Incredible balcony and in winter would have made use of the sauna.

Not terrible in the room more so in the hallway.  I would stay there again.  ,4

Also, several of the rooms had bed bugs which management tried to blame on the travelers even though they came from different parts of the world.

One night, we were even awoken by the sound of a young man who was rummaging through our luggage.

Good location if you are visiting one of the technology offices in kista Super good breakfast.  Cons Room , i was let down. Prices are comparable to Radisson in city. But room is way below par. Minimalistic , which is good. But bathroom was kida poor. Bath area jst had a half way glass, which means post batch, entire bathroom is flooded . And the entire bathroom was sort of smelly.  No fridge/drinking glasses in room(they had in bathroom though, but wouldn't use that for drinking ).  I also started getting low intensive foul smell in room, couldn't figure out what.

2990,This is by far the worst Ritz Carlton I have ever stayed in. Why they have five stars is beyond me. The rooms are nothing special. The bathrooms are very dated. The shower is a challenge. There is just one whole in the wall whereas water comes out ! Mirrors in the room forget it. If you need to get dressed you have to do this in the bathroom. Storage facilities for your cloth negative.   Service in General not friendly at all. There are no shoe horns in the room. I was calling the front desk to provide me with a shoe horn and I am still waiting for that......  In general I will avoid this Hotel and I will never come back.  This is not a five star hotel but they charge five star prices !,1
2991,"the hotel is located fairly central and is easy to even walk to main sights like the brandenburg  gate. easy access from the main central railway station and has several metro lines around. shops nearby, so are restaurants and everything you might need. hotel is modern and clean. rooms are spacious and equipped with everything you might need, even small Haribo packs :D staff friendly and helpful.",4
2992,"Being a WOH and SPG member, either one of their properties are my priority when traveling within the US and worldwide. This was my first at Hyatt Centric the Loop Chicago and for a 4 star property, what a disappointment. Very very poor communication between concierge and front desk in regards to a late checkout. Restaurant/Bar has poor choices, and the property itself including rooms is nothing more than average. Very disappointed and what a waste of money. Much much better choices in Chi Town where I've stayed before. Not recommended.",1
2993,I am a travel agent that books hotels all over the world.  I've dealt with many issues at hotel but none quite like this.  My clients had a issue with their room and the person at the front desk was not helpful so she called me.  I asked to speak with the manager and politely explained the problem.  The manager was so beyond rude and unhelpful.  Cannot believe someone with that type of customer service was in such a position as manager.  He offered no help what-so-ever and on top of that basically hung up on me.  There are too many good hotels in San Francisco to have to deal with poor management and customer service.,1
2994,Had a lovely time here. The room was clean and the staff were helpful. The tax I don’t get but don’t ever get tax anyway. The hotel is close to everything you need and we could see the tower from our room which was a lovely. All in all not that expensive and worth the money.  ,5
2995,"Where do I start ! After booking this hotel over a year ago, we were really looking forward to staying at the Sol Beach House. We knew there may be a wait to check-in but were surprised to hear that if we upgraded to a more expensive room, we could have a room straight away.  Having already paid a considerable amount for the holiday, we declined and were given keys a tiring 6 hours later..not ideal after a 13 hour flight. The room was light and airy with a great view of the sea and a huge bed although there were no power sockets anywhere near a mirror so using straighteners or your own hairdryer was pointless. As already mentioned by a previous reviewer, the pool and sun beds were a disgrace, the pool bar being the worst I have ever seen. It looked like a bad 70's concrete…",2

2997,"We stayed at the Adlon for four nights in June, our third stay at this famous establishment. Where we have been so impressed with the service in the past, we were underwhelmed this time. At checkin it was a scrum, no one organising the arrivals and people pushing past others demanding attention. Once we had our room key were were waved towards the lift and told to go the the first floor. When we stepped out on the floor there was no signage pointing to the rooms, no staff to guide us and it was only after seeking out staff we found someone on the second floor who guided us to the obscure lift to the pool, and via that to the room. It turns out the rooms are hidden behind two sets of large heavy doors, one set with signs to the Administrative offices, and the other with zero…",4

After asking for an extra bed three times, it finally arrived during our dinner out. The hotel needs some refreshing touches, like polishing the room floor, the inevitable scratches in the tub are fine, however the shower tubes from the tub should be refixed to avoid leaking. The shower needs a little new silicone in the edges.  The lamps should be renewed since they are slightly torn in the edges of usage.  The breakfast is standard and with the minimum expected from that standard hotel.  As said, the experience was fine, not worth the detour I expected...",3

A 24hour bus and tram ticket costs 7 Euros and can be purchased from the hotel reception. The hotel is the standard of a motel.  There are tea and coffee in the room but no milk.  The room has a free safe, a good size t.v. and a mini bar. We made a request well in advance to have our room next door to our teenage children, however they were positioned on the 5th floor and us on the 2nd!

They have trapped us for something we did not use. They charged us for full 5 days stay, while some of us only using Wifi and Water for max 3 days. It applied as well for some of us who did not use any 'complimentary facilities' at all.  When we checked out, the front desk officer were so mean to us. Very impolite.

The studios and small apartments are fairly basic but the friendly welcome more than makes up for this and it is easy to see why people return year after year. Its the only hotel we have stayed at where the whole family come out to wave you off when you leave!. Breakfast was included without charge as was the very necesssary air con. The pool is good and the accommodation clean although the shower rooms were very small. The hotel is some 100 yds from a long black beach with many good tavernas. This is a very low stress holiday although it is worth looking over the remainder of the Island which although fairly barren has some dramatic views particularly fron the capital and from Oia.…,3

From my bill because I was in a bay view room with virtually no view of the bay, just loads of buildings with neon signs on their roofs, and a freeway running through them. The bed was two single beds pushed together, with a firm ridge in the middle. This meant no spreading out or luxury sleeping.  A persistent hum filled the room; even when the air con was off.

The Sheraton looked great, with good staff - nice lobby, pleasant room. everything was right, except... a) Why couldn't we get a hot shower? Tepid is just not acceptable, is it? We tried to use the shower at different times of day and night - early morning, late morning, afternoon, evening. All the same tepid experience. We did mention it to the front desk, and there seemed to be a slight warming, but certainly never hot! And, yes, we did know how to operate the slighty-confusing shower controls. This seems to be a basic requirement for a hotel of this caliber. b) Internet connection was really annoying. Every time we returned to the room our devices would re-attach to the hotel wifi.

Offered to take us to our room, and told us about the breakfast and spa robes plus times. The room was lovely, clean bathroom facilities and lovely lighting, and the bed was very comfy.

Don't get me wrong, the hotel is in a stunning location and is very beautiful. It is advertised as a 5 star venue but believe me it is not. The hotel promises many things but despite paying a lot of money for bed and breakfast, the service really is dire. From the moment we arrived ......expecting a sea view from all rooms only to find this isn't true......the company website hadn't been updated for a year.

Some of the rooms have a view of the canal, which is very nice.  Ours looked out over a small interior garden.

We've stayed in Greece plenty of times, so have much to compare the standard of accommodation to. The bed was very uncomfortable (we both had really sore backs by the end of the holiday!) and room was very basic indeed.

The day before we were scheduled to arrive we called the hotel just to make sure our reservation was still fine and they reassured us everything was fine. When we got there we were informed by a very rude and poorly groomed manager that our rooms had been flooded and we had been transferred to another hotel in a less desirable location. They only gave us one bed per room even though we had four to a room and had requested two beds. They double charged our credit cards for the stay and made us go through rings. And loops to get our money back . Moral of the story don't stay here!!,1
3021,Just too far away for me. I knew this when booking but I didn't enjoy being so far out of all the action. The bus was easy enough though. Room was a little 'plastic fantastic'.

Comes with complimentary snacks and drinks in the fridge. They offer luggage storage before check in and after check out, made it so convenient for us!

Those who arrive by car can use the free parking in front of the hotel. Entering the hotel you will find the desk in front of you and the cosy restaurant at the right.

It's possible to find cleaner standards at Chinese budget accommodations.  Also inexcusable: blackout curtains that don't blackout the room because there's nothing to hold them against the marble walls. As a result, they leak light.

Our room was very nice facing the main street.   The bed was comfortable with nice pillows and bed-linen, so we had very good sleep there which made us eager to explore Paris.  The breakfast is excellent, we enjoyed the filter coffee, and great choices of hot and cold food, with delicious breads, croissants, yogurts -pretty much everything you would want, and really set us up for the day.  We couldn't fault it.    The hotel is very highly recommended   The hotel is walking distance to Bastille, Le Marais, Notre Dame etc.   There are excellent restaurants and bars in the area, the most notable is 'Le Monde des Grillades' near Bastille -…",5

They laughed at me when I asked if there were different kind of private rooms. Actually they were but it was a typical reaction at the reception.  After taking a shower in my private room I looked for a towel I did not find. At the reception they told me I had to make a deposit of 100.000 dong for a towel. I think everyone would have liked knowing that before taking his shower.  At 8 am someone was banging my door continuously. The reception girl was screaming ""open the door"".

HOW WRONG WAS I?   The hotel is a 15 min taxi drive away from Amsterdam centre (for which we were charged 25€) .... great start!

That is where the good stuff ends I’m afraid! The room was spacious but not very clean and needs modernising badly. Not totally sure if the bed linen was changed in the week. We had ants around the kettle every night, we didn’t complain so can’t blame the hotel. The room had something splashed down the wall and side of the sofa. The food was the poorest of all inclusive experiences, Luke warm and the same odd combination with little variety. ",3

3053,"As a top status member, I expected more during my stay. No accommodations made. Couldn’t even receive a glass for wine in the room, it had to be plastic. Also, the room service has no standards. One day you get shampoo, gel, conditioner and the other day you get three pots of conditioner.  I had even left a message not to get any additional hair conditioner, because we were not using it. Also, after 23+ days, you also expect at every day to get the water supply replaced. This hotel does not do that. They also don’t greet you at the front desk. They avoid eye contact. The only single thing I have to say positively is the outstanding service during breakfast. Otherwise, the hotel barely knows what your member status with the chain means and don’t care about your neighbor screaming…",2

Tip tops and was like eating at a cafeteria and stay away from Danni's serverd us sour milk when we told them they did nothing so we walked out. All the good food places like country kitchen and eggberts were far from the resort. Dukes was okay. Hotel staff was extremely rude to us. We had a leak in our room and there was mold in room and hallways. Beach at hotel was nice for kids.,2

From what the staff said on check in, this was a bit longer than the usual guests who stay for a couple days and move on.   First, the hotel is right on the M1 / M12 street care route. Easy access to the centre of Berlin, and specifically, Alexanderplatz. If you are going anywhere, you can likely get there from Alexanderplatz!  Certainly, with a Tourists Package (available at the information bureau at Alexanderplatz for about 50€) you get unlimited travel in the A and B spooned of Berlin.

Firstly, the positives:  - The room was spacious with a great view. - The bed was big and very comfortable. - The pool and beach area are lovely. - The grounds and guest areas, such as the lobby, are nice and clean.  There were some areas that we felt could be improved which were:  - The food was the worst we have experienced in any all inclusive resort. The Shack (freshly cooked meals) and The Kitchen (buffet meals) are included in the AI package with Tui.  The Kitchen serves a lot of seafood so you struggle if it's not your thing.

She worked tirelessly to help me and find my items that were to be given to me, yet the managers and other staff seemed to have no clue. The reservation was made a week ahead of time, yet no cards were on offer at check-in (promotionial items), nor till 3 days after my stay had begun.

I also noticed fresh caulking between the bathtub and the wall. It sure covered most of what was mold because only a small portion of the mold area was showing. I then was smelling a moldy odor.

Crescents were warm and delicious but by day 3, I was tired of the bread for breakfast.  Quiet rooms!  Friendly staff manning the 24/7 desk.  The only reason I didn’t give it 5 starts is there is not much storage at all.  It would work for a weekend but we were there 5 days.  No drawers and only a large upper shelf in the bureau.  There were two small nightstand shelf’s that had to suffice for storing clothing.  Warning - if you are headed to Barcelona any time soon, follow the news closely.

Was a little bit pricey but we were experienced that everywhere during the euros.,5

Too expensive for the offer.",4

The front bedroom did allow some noise in from the street, but you are very close to Las Ramblas, so that was not surprising.   We had a takeaway meal from Guell Tapas across the road - we went in and ordered and they delivered about 15 mins later - plates wrapped in foil.  I would definitely stay here again.",4
3080,Overall the staff and the hotel were pleasant. Check in was smooth. Breakfast was ok.  Normal food items. There wasn't a waffle maker.

It is in a great location for seeing major central sights and is also right next to an underground station for visiting sights slightly further afield. We paid extra for garden view rooms which were spacious, well appointed and peaceful. Public areas very pleasant. Breakfast was very good. Excellent concierge service who gave us some great restaurant recommendations. Some of the staff in the lobby and breakfast room could perhaps be a little friendlier but all in all a first class hotel. Would definitely return.",5

I was told that although I reserved a non-smoking room, they only had smoking rooms, but the one I was assigned has been ""cleaned"" of the smoke. I pushed back a little, but to no avail, so I stopped resisting and wanted to go to sleep.

They offer ear plugs but I shouldn't have to use ear plugs when payin g for a 4 star hotel. The air con was rattling and loud. There is a pool area but it was very small and the pool is really shallow. It is easy to get into town using the metro. ",3

There was absolutely no water view from inside the room, even up against the balcony doors.

3111,"Stayed at the JW for a night after 18 months since my last stay at this property in Rio de Janeiro.  This is more of a Marriott than JW one. Not sure why they call themselves a ""Luxury"" hotel.  The currency scam at the front desk is still at the full swing. Marriott's website only displays prices for this hotel in USD and the hotel uses a fake rate that is off by 4% to convert​ this to the payment currency that is BRL. 18 months ago this spread was 7.9% but still unacceptable.  Went to have a breakfast in the club lounge at 930AM only to find out that it had ended at 9AM. Went to the restaurant that was serving breakfast until 11AM or so (rate was breakfast inclusive). Considering the selection, cannot see a reason to pay for the crappy selection.",2

3113,Lovely welcome. The room was clean & had everything you needed. Location is good. But I don't think I would stay here again due to a few things...   We was put on the 3rd floor. Now if you have trouble with stairs this isn't the place for you! There is no lift and the stairs are very steep and narrow!!! There is about 60 steps  I found it a bit tricky getting my suitcase up the stairs on my own. Its the sort of room... You need to make sure you have everything before you leave to go out for the day. Because you can't just POP back to the room due to stairs. I feel they should tell people about the stairs before putting people up so high.   I had a shower went to dry my hair and the hairdryer didn't work... So I had to just put my hair up wet. ( Going out for the day with wet…,3
3114,"Beautiful style hotel however there are certain elements to be ironed out. The rooms were very spacious and decorated to a high standard and were turned down daily. The only downside to this was sometimes it was an inconvenient time (5pm) when we returned to our room and had to get changed for our evening with our room still upside down. We had room 504 which had issues with the drains and made the bathroom area smell a little but had a nice view of the hotel grounds and the local apartments nearby.

When we questioned the hostel about our booking for Meridiano they said that no double room existed at their hostel at all, and that it was an error on the part of the booking sites!

IN spite of the fact that I was checking in at 9:15 pm (the room was paid for from noon), I was told there was no room available ! I had to wait over 20 minutes before I was allotted  a room. While it may perhaps have been true that no room was available (although this reflects poorly on the quality of management at the hotel), what was unacceptable was that the person at the check-in desk clearly lacked the customer-facing skills necessary to handle the situation gracefully.   2.

I spent two nights there - arriving in Lisbon and then the night before leaving Lisbon.    The not-so-good:  No shuttle  service if your flight is early morning or arrive in the afternoon.    You have to walk.  They suggested a  taxi and said it may be around 10-20 Euros for the 200 meter trip uphill.  No breakfast if the flight is early - told I can get sandwich and juice.  No coffee.

Was moved second night which was welcome/necessary.  Great location. Rooms have a nice trendy finish and furnished thoughtfully. Be warned about the “brunches” which are really antisocial for guests and incredibly noisy. Not informed about it until evening before with a note saying areas would be out of bounds for guests and could be some noise disruption. Large groups of drunk people spilling out of hotel so best to just go out for the day - not a place to chill out.  Would probably be rated 4 if not for the broken air conditioning. ,3

The room was spacious clean and comfortable but noise insulation was poor. The balcony was private.  All in a three star hotel masquerading as 4 stars. The facilities though are good I.e. swimming pools, massage treatments, small gym.

Unfortunately I do not find the front desk staff particularly friendly, which is shame.  It's not hard to greet your guests when they come and go.

The hotel did not tell us when we first check in the hotel, and we got charged for five nights total more than $200. And in additions, the room is very awkwardly structured, there is big gap between tv and the bed. You will not able to watch the tv as the tv stand is very far away from the bed. They put us the corner room and low level room when I requested high level floor. This hotel is probably one of the worst hotel I ever stayed. Trust me, please stay way from this hotel. You have plenty other hotels around with same price because they charged you this hidden fee you were not aware of it. This hotel doesn't eligible for a four star hotel.",1

We spent the day on the Hop-on-off Bus and toured the city, returned to the rental office at 5pm, retrieved our luggage and they helped us get a mini-van taxi for 4 of us (and luggage) to Villarroel.

There were a number of large conferences going on at our hotel and we were placed in the North Wing . At least a 5 minute walk from reception. Rooms were of a good size but view from room was of hotel outbuilding with meant no little natural light . Room was clean but there was mould around the bath tiles which was not expected .   Use of the swimming pool /sauna was an extra £25 which was an unbelievable extra charge for a hotel resident . The only person to use this facility was our tour guide - presumably complementary!   Breakfast could only be described as a scrum! Hundreds of guests…,2

They declare themselves a 4-star hotel, but to be honest, I've stayed at much more better places in USA and Europe with these marketised characteristics.

I'm not sure these two sweet grandparents in wheelchairs and their grandchildren really know what's going on, or that the staff admitted there is no danger and no mandate from the authorities--it's just their company policy.

I know Mr. Marriott senior is looking down frowning upon this hotel because it was horrible at best. Staff was rude and looked at my family funny, and was not helpful.

Could not find fault with  the room at all. Was clean and a pleasure to stay in. Breakfast was really good too and had a good selection of food for all. Both myself and my husband found it very enjoyable. Only one complaint was that the coffee and milk in room was not replaced daily even though my husband (who speaks fluent German) left a note for them.

What if I do not answer this question? And as it turned out, ""Holiday/private/leisure/visiting friends/sightseeing"" are the answers which mean you will have to pay extra EUR 3,18 for nothing.   Does a private trip mean that I use the room EUR 3,18 ""more"" than on a business trip?

Anyone who knows about St. Patrick's Day in Chicago knows it's one of the busiest days of the year to visit. We had planned on staying at a friend's place, but last minute decided a hotel would be a better option. We found a reasonable rate at the Swisshotel and were surprised a hotel that seemed so luxurious was that great of a deal last minute...well, it should have been a red flag.   When we arrived at the hotel, we were NOT notified of any constuction. We went to bed late (around 3) and were woken up at the lovely hour of 7 to LOUD construction above us. It literally sounded like a jackhammers were having a party at at bowling alley. We called to the front desk…",1
3235,"So clean and well kept. No toiletrees except bathing soap bolted to the Wall in bath and  no handsoap near sink, which could be nice due to hygiejne. Many very nice details in room, very beautiful designed and all through the place Its really pretty and we would definetely go back. Love the kidfriendly atmosphere and playcorner, so great👍 We arrived at midnight with 3 tired kids and came Quick to the room. Only thing that was not so nice, was the unfriendly man at desk. We didnt feel all that welcome.",4
3236,"Because Berlin was busy, we ended up not paying a budget price for the Motel One Mitte, so in terms of value for money, our experience was probably not typical of those that stay here. Even so, the hotel does a good job of providing a top quality base from which to explore Berlin. Right by one of the exits to Moritzplatz U-bahn station (3 stations from Alexanderplatz), on the edge of Mitte, where it joins the edgy Kreuzberg - this is an exciting and scruffy area of Berlin to stay in - a location more suited to the young, perhaps, than those seeking an upmarket, genteel experience. The hotel itself - as you would expect - is well designed - maximising the comfort and convenience from a shortage of space. Bedrooms are small - ours contained a comfortable double bed, separate duvet…",4
3237,"The hotel is clean and bright and in the perfect location for a short break in Lisbon  The room was small, even though we had booked an XPD room with a river view, but was adequate for our short stay but if you plan to stay for more than 3 nights I would find somewhere with bigger rooms. There were only a couple of things I thought could be better, there was a 1.50€ charge for using the coffee in the room and there was a slight smell of sewage in the lift, which the reception denied they new about but there were air fresheners in the area.",3
3238,"Stayed here for a conference up the road. The flat was clean and practical. As other reviewers have noticed, you can easily hear the activities of other residents. Apart from that I have no complaints.",4

3240,"I spent a five-day visit at this hotel.   The amazing, scenic views are worth the visit for sure. The rooms are beautiful and the service was acceptable.  I spent time in the spa having a message and a mani/pedi - which were amazing and wonderful.  What disappoints me is upon check-in, we pointed out that we were celebrating our 10th anniversary, and also we are Platinum members which would allow us an upgrade if possible, and we were told that all of the other rooms were ""fully committed.""  Now we were traveling with a group and there was a reduced group rate, and I certainly would have understood if the desk staff were prohibited from upgrading for Platinum members in that situation.  However, that is not what we were told.  We were told the rooms (with a terrace or a terrace…",2

The ground was not clean, the 2 plugs next To the bed were not working, the bible was full of dust, and you can't switch off the light from your bed.. but I have to say ... the bed is the best!!! I slept like a baby! And that is really important :) I noticed that the staff was kind and helpful, really customer focus, devoted, and always smiling.. thank you to all of them for their kindness. I will come back and I hope that some of these points will be improved :) ",3
3243,"We came for two days of relaxation and had problems from the moment we walked into our room. First the fireplace in the bedroom had to be repaired as we checked in and 24 hours after the fix, it needed to be fixed again (technician one). The DVD player had to be rewired (different technician). The room lights work on some system that sometimes requires a room key to be inserted but not consistently (third technician). The air conditioning system only works if the room key is inserted in the slot by the door but then some of the lights can't be turned off. There were apologies for the inconvenience by management but we really didn't want to talk to them four times during our stay. We do not recommend this resort. Yes, the grounds are nice but for the price, everything should be…",2

Facilities are nice, with the typical Chinese Internet, where Google (gmail), Youtube, Facebook, twitter is more or less disabled unless you use a VPN account.  Rooms are equipped with the largest bed I have ever slept in, with plenty of pillows and a huge duvet. The rooms are clean and relatively new.  AC is offered, but not controllable by guest. With means that come 7PM, the temperature is increased to a blistering hot 27,5 C. Through work, I have stayed at this hotel a few times. Same story. Contact to Housekeeping renders no solution. They can offer a fan, but thats it.  If you like warm nights, this is the place for You :-)",2
3246,This hotel is quite a bargain. It's modern and Service is friendly. Rai station is close by but it's a bit far from city centre. We were impressed by the quality and comfort of the  rooms. It's spacious as well. We would love to stay again.,3
3247,"A collection of small details not being in place stop this hotel being as good as it should be. Collectively, they added up to a disappointing experience.   The good: Lots of staff Nice lobby Rooftop pool is lovely and a quiet oasis from the bustle of Sao Paulo Comfortable beds  The bad: I stayed in three rooms over 10 days in and out of the city. Lot of items in the rooms are chipped, stained or broken. One of my TVs was loose and at an angle, another fuzzy. There were chips on tables, or stains on worktops.  The balcony doors in 2 of 3 rooms wouldn't seal shut, meaning my room was noisy, particularly on the 8th floor and on any room on the West side, where I was woken avery morning by extremely loud music from the ground floor fitness studio next door.  The wifi is close to…",2

The glaring flaw is the lighting.  Hallways are very dim, you can barely make out the room numbers.   In room lighting is almost non existent.  If you want to read or see what clothes you are wearing go to the bathroom.  It's the only place with decent lighting.  Hope it's not hot in Stockholm when you arrive.  Air conditioning is very poor.  ",3
3250,Location at Lido is very good but service and facilities don't quite meet the four stars. Rooms (especially bathrooms) world need some renovating. Also the service should be a little bit more friendly. Pool area ja quite nice and otherwise the facilities are good. ,3
3251,"This was a week long business trip and my wife and I added a couple nights on our own.  Every night was great.  Very accommodating.  Food was excellent. Perfect location, you can sit outside at many different restaurants and Cafe's in walking distance.   The beach is right across the street and the walkway makes for a perfect stroll or run along the Ocean front.    ",5
3252,"Hotel was great, would have been great to have a double bed duvet on the bed instead of 2 singles. It would also be better if they could add a coffee making area in the hotel room. Otherwise the hotel was fantastic especially the location.",4
3253,"At the top of the hill, past the Bario Alto, you will find this hotel with great views over Lisbon. It’s in a convenient and trendy location with great restaurants at your doorstep. However, for about 350€ a night, the services didn’t justify the price. The superior terrace room 103 was so small (25sq meters), you could hardly walk around the bed. The outdoor terrace is not private, so you stare at your neighbors. There is no fitness facility and no spa. And, the outside area and bar is never open rain or shine, just covered in rain tarps. Then, when asking for more nespresso  pods, I was told that they are added daily to the mini-bar, so I should order room service coffee.  Really, 5 star? You can find better hotels with more services down the road. ",3
3254,"We chose this hotel because of the fireplaces, since it was going to be in the 40s and 50s we thought it would be nice to sit by fire and have a bottle of wine.  Unfortunately they didn’t have them on Sunday or Monday, we asked to have a fire lit Monday.  They did but we ran up to the room to grab something and they turned it off and covered it for the night...it was only 5 pm.  Another family complained as well.  Super disappointing because we chose this hotel specifically for the fires.  They don’t even have the patio heaters going. 😕",2
3255,"I have traveled a lot in my day, and I have to say this was one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in, and the absolute worst customer service. When I first arrived, my hotel room smelled of smoke and did not have an internet connection. After waiting an hour I was given a different room, but at best the internet connection was awful. The second night I arrived back to no power in my room, and when calling the front desk I was told to wait and was not given an exact time of when it would be fixed. about two hours later someone came to my door to check the power.I also asked for a manager and was told they would contact me at 8am the following day. I had to go down twice the next morning to speak to the manager, who was supposed to follow up with me but never did to this day.…",1

Not a bad location as short walk to main thoroughfares ,incl Ave Diagonal with all its shops. 15 min walk in other direction to the beach and Port Olympic. Recommend the city bus tours as you can hop on and off wherever you please, great way to see all the main sites. Breakfast was included in our  trip and was on the whole very good. Both hot and cold options are available, wide choice of pastries, meats, fruit etc. Buffet is continually bring replenished by the efficient staff. Only gripe is that on our second day our room wasn’t cleaned,beds not made, disappointing. All in all nice basic hotel in a pretty good location.",4
3257,"This was the perfect place for us to stay. We don’t need a lot of frill and extras. We had a very nice, clean and comfortable room that had windows that opened out to the city street making it fun to watch the busy city while staying in. The staff was VERY professional and accommodating. The breakfast was wonderful and again, the staff (breakfast lady also) were so nice. The front desk man was helpful when we asked information on metro and other information. ",5
3258,"Excellent location, very close to the U Bahn and shopping wallhallahs of Berlin. very friendly staff at the check in. The rooms were also excellent. Even the basic one that we had. its was well presented and comfortable. No complaints there.  We went for a drink at the Monkey Bar. that was very busy and in my view nothing special.  The buffet breakfast was excellent. we normally try to discover other breakfast options in Berlin but I have to say that the breakfast buffet was worth it.  Will deff come back to this hotel again.",4

It is a former Soviet hotel converted to modern standards and had been excellently upgraded. I had an apartment room on the eight floor with a full kitchenette. The room was huge with wonderful views. Despite, the cold outside the room was always warm.   The bathroom was well appointed and the bed very comfortable.   Now for the problems.   There was no hot water after around noon. There was no more hot water until the next morning. This was every day of my stay here. Other guests of different floors also experienced the same issue.   We went to dine on two occasions in the rooftop restaurant on the 11th floor.  The Friday night we were there early and…",2
3263,"A few things to note:  - The pool is a lap pool...inside. We thought we would arrive and enjoy a nice pool outside in the summer sun. Nope.  - The building appears to also house residents. We were confused as to who was a hotel guest and who was a resident. - The room was underwhelming. Old room, strange decor.  - Check-in was strange. We used points, they couldn't find the reservation, I provided the number. About 15 minutes later it was resolved.   We wouldn't stay here again. ",2

Décor is , what can only be described as strange from the leopard print carpet in hallways and stairs to the colour combinations within the room, the room has excellent soundproofing, best minibar prices in Paris, Breakfast is a pleasant experience with a nice combination of pastries, breads and fruit. The hotel in an excellent location for the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees, this hotel is definitely worth a visit",5

3267,Beware of the hotel due to poor business practice. I canceled our reservation two weeks in advance but they would not refund my money due to some promotion they claimed I paid for the reservation under. All I did was make reservations online like I would any hotel. I have never dealt with a hotel that refused to refund my money. It was a double win for them because they kept our $610.00 then were able to rebook the room to someone else to score another $610.00. What a scam!,1
3268,"Extremely poorly constructed high rise building, dated and deteriorating interior, walls and windows so thin could hear everything from the street even on 16th floor, terribly noisy also from contrustruction and traffic... simply unpleasant. Would not recommend or stay here again. The only positive, the staff is friendly and wants to be accommodating. Breakfast was poor quality and variety. Frankly, the city of Danang was a huge disappointment. Suggest to stay in Hoi An and venture to the small neighbouring villages for a more authentic and beautiful Vietnam.",2

We usually don't stay at boutique hotels and prefer the larger chains.......they seem to offer some consistency, but i think there was something going on in Chicago and we were having a hard time finding a room. The room was the smallest hotel room that I have ever stayed in. There was barely enough room for the Queen size bed.There was no chair or anyplace to sit, the TV was mounted on a wall beside the bed....very awkward ,the building next door was under construction allowing the construction workers to peer into our room from ten feet away. The temperature in the room was impossible to control and the window was broken. Very disappointed.",1

The room and fridge (which was not cold, btw) is completely booby-trapped with sensors: You move whatever billable item: A water bottle, a minibar item, sugar for the coffee machine and *ding*! You are immediately irreversibly and automatically billed in your room for the item that you have just moved. Friendly, huh? I was wondering if I were traveling with my kids what could have happened in my bill. If you are unhappy about that, the hotel will bill you $30 for locking the fridge.

I would have been happy to overlook all of that were it not for the atrocious service. Not only did none of this seem to faze anybody at the front desk; I didn't get an apology for the miscoded key they gave me when I checked in.

It is connected to the Palais de Congres (convention center) by the Porte Maillot metro station, so it is not right in the center of things, but it is very easy to get around, and the surrounding neighborhood is quite nice.

My comment was that it was like my cooking - and that's not a compliment!  Scrambled egg, bacon etc was sent back twice, returning the 2nd time with a hot plate and cold food, which was interesting, if it had been in a microwave.  If your intention is to eat out every evening and only eat the cold breakfast (cheese, meat, etc) you would not complain.  The hot plates supposedly keeping the food warm had to be turned up, even early in the morning, when everything should have been piping hot.  Apart from the fact that the food was unpalatable, it could be a health risk, especially with eggs.…",3
3299,"While the hotel is brand new and the location is a great alternative to out-of-the center hotel which require boring public transport transportation, instead of a ferry boat sea trip…our 4-night stay experience was spoiled! It's the first time we were not able to get a transformer plug for the 'English plug"" in a hotel! We've travelled all over Europe and it was never a problem - that is why we were never bringing one of our own. But in Brooklyn we were requested to BUY it for 10 EUROS! I begged to ‘borrow it for 5 minutes’ and was granted a permission which appeared the one time deal. The next morning I was informed that only plastic wrapped (new) plugs were left, and therefore take it (EUR10) or leave it. Shame, really...it was supposed to be a 4 star hotel...  Also, it was…",3

Initially, I was going to stay at the Palmer, but decided that it looked a bit dated from pictures on the hotel website, so opted instead for the W Chicago - City Center.  Sure, it was a bit more expensive, but it looked to have a good vibe.  And that's true, for the lobby, bar and other public areas.  But I was in town on business, with work to do, so was only really concerned about the room.  I booked a ""standard"" queen at $500 (tax included), as I was just going to need the room for sleeping and cleaning up.  No luxury required, aside from nice bedding.  As I was checking in, the desk attendant indicated ""it is a smaller room, so we include free wifi with it"".  Alarm bells go off in my…",1

Kudamm is a busy commercial street, but our room was quiet and comfortable. My main gripe was the lack of firm pillows and the thick duvet and asking at the desk drew a blank.     The restaurant has good food and a copious breakfast, but we took to exploring less expensive cafes nearby.",4

It has a wonderful internal courtyard at which you can have a relaxing time with a drink. The rooms are clean elegant comfortable, very quiet, and of good value. The location is absolutely perfect, as it is in a very safe area of Paris, full of shopping (Monoprix a large and well priced grocery store is only 3 minute walk away in the basement of the commercial centre), and very close to the eiffel tower. Book early as it get full quickly.",5

We got the room at a very low rate so it was fine for 2 nights ",3

Next to the station on the right is an excellent Patisserie and a very decent restaurant, and across the way was an always busy bar that was lively and fun, though it was a bit on the pricey side. One street over and there was a Carrefour City supermarket that is open from 7AM-7PM.  The hotel itself was very clean, quiet and quite nice, even if the rooms were a tad on the small side, even by European standards.

The early morning flight means when you get to the hotel you have up to 3-4 hours wait to get to your room... apparently this is international checkin!!!! They don’t tell you that until your on the bus coming here!  Although never in my life with TUI have I ever had to wait this long for room. Took roughly 2 hours or so of constant complaining to get to the room which overlooked the top of the water park.

The room was amazing with fantastic views over the valley. The room had an amazing balcony to enjoy these views with an outside bath. However outside of the room we were disappointed. The market, which sold coffee was expensive, poorly stocked and offered truly awful service levels. In Starbucks you get better attention. What really let down the hotel was the River Ranch pool area. This is the only pool that any children under 16 could occupy and was the smallest and very overcrowded with small children. It was rarely attended by staff and was littered with used dishes and cutlery. Our teenagers were too young for the adult pool, but…",2

The hotel was easy to find and set in a nice location but be aware it was a tram ride away from the main centre of Amsterdam if you go for shopping. We were given a glass of prosecco on arrival, informed about the surrounding area and helped to our room with luggage. We had to give a payment card for guarantee for any extras whilst staying (which happens in most hotels) but after a week of returning home and settling our bill upon leaving, we still are awaiting the funds be withheld.

While the rooms are nice and the staff pleasant, the location of the hotel is not conducive to a relaxing weekend - maybe a quick business trip, but not for stays over two days.  First:  The hotel is right next to an open sewer pit, called the Marginal - the smells coming from this ""river"" are horrendous and the hotel is helpless (it seems) to do anything about it - the smell is so bad that it is uncomfortable to stay at the pool, walk outside at night, or worse - when you open your hotel room's door in the morning, the smell is in the hallways!

Our next day, we got back to the hotel at 4pm and again, the room hadn’t been cleaned.

3324,"One80 Hostel is a good place to stay in Berlin. The rooms are clean, spacious and actually quite luxurious for a hostel. The bathrooms in particular were a surprise as they were what you might expect from a 5* hotel, rather than a backpackers place! The location is good for Alexanderplatz in particular and serves as a good midway place between the main sights of Berlin to the West and the clubbing district to the East.  However, the lift system is annoying, long waits were common and there are 10 floors so the stairs aren’t an easy option! Although the staff were friendly and helpful, the bar was slow (although we were there in World Cup time) and breakfast was disappointing. I would still recommend One80 Hostel however.  ",4

However, this was probably my worst stay of all my 90+ nights at Hilton properties in 2019. this was mainly due to two 3 primary things  1. Downgraded - I paid 82 000 Hilton points for two nights in a Queen Bedroom. On the day of my arrival, the reception simply tells me the hotel is fully booked and that they can not accommodate me in a queen bedroom. Hence I got a twin bedroom for my stay at the Curio instead...   2.

The staff who welcomed us were so friendly and we loved arriving into the lobby, with guests still milling about and cosied up with cocktails.  Besides our amazing loft room, we really enjoyed breakfast at the hotel restaurant (loads of choice for us veggies including a very moreish vegan rice pud!), grabbing coffee in the lobby and drinks after a day’s sightseeing.

We also had a spa massage and was told €150 total, but after the massage the receipt said €195, apparently there was a extra we were not told about.

3342,Stayed at this hotel because it was near to the airport and we had to take a flight the next day.  Previous stays in the area already made me aware of the problems of parking here and so I chose this hotel because it had a hotel carpark.  Arrived early but even then the lady at reception mentioned that the hotel carpark was fully booked and her brusque manner didn't help things. The doorman was helpful and pointed out places where i could park but also conceded it would be difficult. True enough I spent nearly 45 mins later that night just trying to get a space. This hotel also caters to tour groups which can be noisy as well as delay check-ins (as we experienced).,3

The employees were clearly overwhelmed by complaints and the issues I believe stem from poor management.

Also when we went back home we discovered a hold on our card for over $500! We were not pleased. On the plus side we liked the location and the beds were comfy.",2
3359,The hotel staff were unfailingly helpful and very friendly. They facilitated an early check in and any requests were very  promptly satisfied.  The room was very spacious and spotless with very comfortable beds. It was also extremely quiet and the location was convenient to the airport and mitte. ,5
3360,"Great location, right in the middle of the main shopping street, walkable to many hop on hop off buses. Close to train and bus stations and many restaurants! Room was clean and comfortable. Staff friendly and helpful. Good stay",4
3361,"We are young couple of artists and me, and my wife we found what we were looking for. We stayed in spacious rooftop room which is a two floor suite with balcony pool and Parisian rooftop view, and separate shower on the second floor, and comfortable king size bed, and separate bathtub on the first floor. Bathtub is best with wine that can also be found in the hotel room. Hotels wine choice is great. Rooftop view is the best at sunset, or sunrise. Amazing chill spot to sit, smoke, talk, drink and just enjoy. The pool can be a challenge in December, but Paris is really not that cold so, if you get lucky with having some sun and no wind you can feel quite good in the pool. Hot shower is on the same floor right next to the pool. Overall we were looking for great location, aesthetic, space, all inclusive relaxation and also place that tells a story through image and we got that.…",5
3362,"The hotel is clean, rooms are comfortable and the staff is very kind and friendly.The nearest stop of the metro is at a 5 minute walk.  The best part of the hotel is the entrance and the hall... the forniture is unique and cozy..   I will go here again.",5
3363,I was shocked about the customer service level at this hotel. Staff needs training and it was not to International standards.  Maybe was because of the events during that week. We paid over $260.00 per night but absolutely it was not worth it. ,2
3364,"We stayed here for one night in late September, as to get a head-start on the crowds (ie millions of people) descending on the Golden Hands Bridge and pagoda - of the six hotels we experienced in Vietnam, this was the worst.  Pros:  *You can enjoy the Bridge and the accompanying views, when all the crowds have gone home (I can’t stress enough just how rammed and busy this place is during the day - massively over-congested) *If you’re feeling sprightly, you can take the first cable-car (07:15) and enjoy the early morning light over Da Nang *The rooms are spacious, with comfy beds   Cons: *The whole place is dated, shabby, and worn-down - paint flaking off the wall, dirty carpets, and odd smells  *The staff either ignore you or completely stifle you - they haven’t mastered a…",2
3365,Very clean hotel with new furniture and what looks like recently renovated bathrooms. It is situated in a quiet neighbourhood close to a metro station. The staff were pleasant and helpful. The hotel is close to the city center and yet the prices are very reasonable.,5
3366,It was absolutely one of the best price-quality balance for me. Everything in room have had very well quality and it is very close to train station and beach. Owner of the hotel was very polite and friendly. ,5
3367,"Really liked this hotel. Having been to Berlin many times for both work and pleasure, I really enjoyed this hotel. Lucky enough to be upgraded to a deluxe room and loved getting a welcome custard tart in my room upon arrival.   Room was spacious, great of TV Tower and was impressed with the Aveda shampoo/conditioner and shower gel in the bathroom. Quite stylish and good selection at breakfast. ",4
3368,"We were close to town, so walking to restaurants, stores, sunset were easy. Staff was very friendly. A little small though. We took turns holding the shower head for the other to shower. Kind of romantic though. For the price, we couldn't beat it.  ",3
3369,"ERRIBLE! Save your money, go elsewhere. Stayed here three nights and it was a total nightmare. The first night I stayed the staff knocked on my door / called my room at least 5 times to ask if I wanted $35/night valet parking (which I refused over and over). The bed was very uncomfortable there was no AC and the condition of the room was really old and ruinous. I had to check out and back into my room twice during my stay because they told me they were unable to book the same room for multiple nights since I had booked via Groupon. I used the iron to press a shirt and it tore a hole through the shirt (on the delicate / low setting) nothing was done to help cover the cost of the damage (I have been asking to speak to a manager for 4 days and have yet to have anyone contact me /…",1
3370,Avoid breakfast at peak time - and specially avoid asking for an omelette - it can take longer than expected - the breakfast variety is somehow limited - You can wait for the lifts for some time at peak times,3
3371,The manager said the cancelation policy was 24 HR notice. We decided to leave on a Monday instead of Tuesday. That's $299 for Monday. The hotel refuses to give back the money. I have called four times today and it's Sunday. That's more than 24hrs. The manager says it's the accounting departments problem. I will never use them to book a hotel again.   If I could give them no stars I would. I consider that stealing. $299 is not right!!  I feel cheated and most of all disrespected.,1
3372,"Looking for a relatively inexpensive Autumn break in a warm climate, and having stayed in Funchal on numerous occasions (mainly in the excellent Pestana Promenade), we decided to book a week's holidayat Baixas de Canico, not far from Funchal. Overall, we were more than happy with our holiday. We actually expected to stay at the Roca del Mar, one of the other two hotels in a triumvirate of hotels that seem to interchange facilities {with all the main meals taken at the Roca del Mar). However, we were very happy with the Royal Orchid, where we enjoyed a large sea view room on the 5th floor, with kitchen facilities (but actually no washing up liquid, tea/coffee sachets which seemed mean). We were disappointed not to have a bath, but the shower was fine. We only had bed and…",3
3373,"I stayed in El Misti Rooms for 3 weeks recently and honestly I was expecting a lot better from reading the reviews. I'm VERY surprised at all of the good reviews the hostel gets. This is a very average hostel which needs a lot of improvement.  I stayed in a 9 bed dorm. The room was tiny for 9 people and very cramped. The beds were very rusty which resulted in a few of my garments getting destroyed. The bathrooms are regularly cleaned, however they are in serious need of an upgrade and the bathroom on the third floor flooded twice due to the faulty sink.   Most staff members were quite friendly and pleasant. However, there was a lady that worked most nights in the kitchen who was extremely rude on a number of occasions. She shouted at guests, myself included and made it extremely…",2
3374,Pretty disappointed. Front desk was lazy and disinterested.  Room product was exceptionally small.  Beware of the wooden bed box that juts out and is super easy to bang your shin against!  TV did not allow me to check out despite menu option for exactly that. Missing the boutique vibe.  Charging a resort fee for such a low end property is particularly maddening...  ,1
3375,"We have just returned from a short stay at this very sweet hotel in Paris. The hotel is in a great location just a few steps from Notre-Dame.  The reception area was very welcoming and the reception staff were very friendly and helpful at all times. The hotel is very clean and the room was spotless, spacious and comfortable. The view from room 602 is stunning!  I would highly recommend this hotel and I’m sure I will be back again soon.  To all the staff at Henri IV Rive Guache - thank you for making our short trip to Paris a very happy one! My daughter said it was her best birthday ever! 😊",5
3376,Staff that could not comprehend requests. Non functional bathtub - paid higher for premium club room and was unable to use the benefits. Breakfast issue too - included but staff blocked. Room service orders also did not come as requested.,2
3377,"The bar is on the small side for a conference hotel but the rooms were fantastic. I enjoyed a view over the beach which was a welcome sight to wake up to each morning. Breakfast would get busy but it had a great selection of food. The gluten free selection was great, amazing break options but also pastries (I didn't get a chance to try them which was disappointing!). The staff are very friednly and happy to help, it works out more cost effective to order a taxi to the airport via the hotel too. The cherry on top was how close it was to the conference centre.... easy for the metro too so a huge win win.",4
3378,"My husband and I booked this hotel for a night before we flew to Bangkok.   Pros:  - cheap  - breakfast buffet had a good selection  - shower was good  - bathroom seemed clean  - location is good - we went to the amusement park down the road and it was such a fun time. There is also a night market near the amusement park for good eats and entertainment   Cons:  - the hotel was quite dirty. Upon opening the binder in the room, we found used Saran Wrap and Kleenex. Not to mention, the hallways clearly hadn’t been vacuumed in some time - used q-tips and other garbage on the floor - the walls are quite thin. It’s very easy to hear guests talking, even though they don’t seem to be talking too loud.   I wouldn’t stay here again, but it’s decent for a night’s stay.",2
3379,"Rooms are very old and shower doesn't work very well. The feeling staying there is that the room wasn't cleaned in a while. The curtains super old and almost falling. I had the itches in the room If it wasn't the company paying, would choose this hotel and don't recommend to anyone.",2
3380,It was very poorly arranged. They had two different functions costing Rs.5000/- and Rs.6000/- and both were poorly conducted. Went their with lot of expectations as they are having 5-star tag. Rs.6000/- function had a DJ party which was conducted in a small hall cramped with guests and ear piercing loud noise reverberating in the small hall. It was a punishment to be in the hall. I had attended more than 20 new year parties in different parts of the country and this was the worst experience I ever hard. It was felt that the games were conducted not impartially. Overall it was a bad experience.,2
3381,The best thing about this place is the friendly staff.  The hostel is great and clean and a good location but the staff went above and beyond when I booked a ticket to Sagrada LaFamilia and when my wallet was stolen ,4
3382,"My husband and I want to warn people not to book rooms for your wedding here!  We only wanted to use this hotel because it is on the same block that we live; therefore, we would be close to our friends and family.  Instead of just holding rooms at a certain price until a particular date before the event (in which at that point, they would go back into system), we had to guarantee exactly how many rooms and give them a credit card to pay for rooms that we didn't fill....luckily, we filled all rooms...and had to ""beg"" for a few more at our rate.  Really bad system. Also, we just got back from our honeymoon, and there are still charges on my credit card that they mistakingly charged me for that they said would be removed.  The only positives was that our guests really liked the…",1
3383,Good experience at your hotel in Paris.  I will come and stay there more often.  I like your gym and breakfast besides a good and clean room.  Your staff is also courteous and helpful.  Glad they could make an umbrella available for me due to the rains.,5
3384,"The lobby, room and breakfast are fine- like all the average hotels. The worst was a happenning during the night. Around midnight, I was sleeping when a man entered in my room, saying ""governança"" (something like ""housekeeping""). I woke up very scared, shouted :""whats that?"" and called the reception looking for some explanation. I was told: ""we will check whats going on"". Later I called again: ""maybe the servant intended to take something to another room and entered your room by mistake..."".  After that I tried to lock my door- but there is no security lock in the room door! Next morning when I left the hotel, in the check out I asked again: ""did you discovered whats has happen last night""? The reception employee said: "" our manager will call you"". It was more than 36 hours ago-…",2
3385,"From outside, it looked like what a grand hotel should.  Going in, you’d be disappointed - small, narrow, and worst of all, smelly... Bathroom is super super tiny, no space for anything really, not even a small toiletry bag.   There is no free Wifi, you have to pay 13 odd dollars for a very low speed connection. Really? It’s disgraceful!!  Blacklist forever!",1
3386,"Highly recommend this hotel.  The staff was friendly and very helpful.  The location is fantastic.  Plenty of great places to eat nearby, metro station directly across the street, breakfast was wonderful. The room was clean, beds were comfortable, plenty of hot water - everything that is needed for a stay in Paris. A great place to stay.  Yes, we will be back next year.  Thank you.",5
3387,"All the consierges were very knowledgeable and helpful.  I wish I could remember the name of the young man from June 28 and 29 on tye overn7ght shift.  My wife has a very strict diet for medical reasons, and he did a wonderful job translating and even adding pictures of the foods she could and could not consume.  The hotel is only a few minutes walking from major attractions and shopping.  We even strolled over to the Moulin Rouge.  There are 3 cafes just outside the hotel with wonderful menus and very friendly staff.",5
3388,"We had a 3-night stay at the Sofitel Shanghai Hyland. The only good thing about this hotel is its location. Otherwise, we were disappointed by the staff. They understood very little English and were clearly miserable, poorly trained and unpleasant. You won't see a single person smile here. Overall unhappy vibes.  Also, our reservation included a 2-hour late checkout which the hotel refused to honor without any explanation. This was for a Wednesday checkout too, so go figure.   The last annoyance was that the housekeeper ignored the  ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on our door while we were away from our room. We also found a dirty rag in our bathroom upon our return.  I'll skip over Sofitel Shanghai Hyland on my next visit to Shanghai.",2
3389,"We are really frustrated as this hotel has changed so much. It’s not the average Hilton hotel. The staff can be friendly- depends on the time of day, room service- EXTREMELY bad.-don’t order anything. Ordered the Turkey Club and a Caesar- the dressing was all Mayo- yuck! The rooms have no dresser, VERY THIN walls and our bed has a big dip in the middle of it. The location however is amazing. Close to everything! We all have what’s most important to us and service is ours. I’m sorry for the bad review but we came back for nostalgia and were let down. Valet was great- quick and friendly.",1

The hot water was non existent one morning until the shower valve was replaced, I had just went on a 5 mile run and had to wait an hour and half before I showered.  Every morning the hot water would take about 15 minutes and it would get way hot and then way to cold it was hard to get right a slight bump to the valve and it would go hot or cold.  It was miserable. Just don’t get room 630, I should have asked for a new room.",1

3392,"I only liked the location.The booking was done through Hotwire and you have to prepay. The down side is you do not know what hotel you will get. They don't give you any kind of price adjustment when the rates go down. When I got there they stuck me in their very old, dated building across the street. I wanted a refund, however Hotwire will not under any circumstances do that. I think this was 100% misrepresented. At least with all other nearby hotels, they give their customers a cup of coffee. Not  a value at all!",1
3393,"We stayed in this hotel last February. Check in was smooth and they offered us a glass of Cava on arrival. Room was great with a huge balcony and a nice view.   We had a small inconvenient with the room, but they sorted it out quickly. Breakfast was included and they offered a big variety; however, service could improve a bit in this area.  All in all a great stay, you can find some minor faults, but for sure they'll improve.  I would definitely comeback and would recommend it.",4

The entrance is a bit confusing because the actual check in is across the street at the upscale Hotel Albrechtshof. Arriving at 2PM, the English-speaking clerk was efficient, except our requested quiet upper floor double was not yet cleaned, so we strolled the neighboring streets. 40 minutes later we were on the elevator to our 2nd floor #286.

3397,"Oh dear, I really wanted to love this place as we've been to Madeira to a Portobay hotel four times and are going again next year.  First the good, the location is excellent, and we were lucky to have a room on the quiet side of the hotel away from the building noise opposite. The whole place is clean and the pool area is super, the staff all speak to you and the place has the ambience of a quality 5 star establishment.  But there are too many drawbacks. Those who design hotel rooms should be forced to live in them,  Our wardrobe was so shallow (front to back) the hangers were facing you, so that it was very difficult to put clothes away or get them out, and only room for 6 altogether. The bathroom door was a sliding one, glass onto concrete - the noise was very loud and we were…",3

It had everything you needed in the room, 6 wardrobes/compartments, wash area and a shared wet room. The sheets were delivered and the staff were quite nice and helpful and they also spoke very clear English which was a good surprise. Overall it was a nice experience even though we did hardly stay in the hotel, would recommend going in a group as the idea of sharing a room is not to my taste. Also very good price!",3

Please see other issues below, but most importantly, however, my girlfriend left a piece of jewelry in the room and the staff handled this situation extremely poorly and in the end I am: 1)  100% sure this was stolen by a Holiday Inn staff member (we are positive as to where it was left) ; 2) Also sure that they could care less.  As soon as we got home and she realized she did not have it we called to let them know exactly where the box with the necklace was left.

Staff were always attentive and ready to help. there was a mix up on the first night regarding our twin room, we were allocated a double. this was rectified on the 2nd night. Breakfast was ample and there was no rush to get to the food and there was a chill out area for guests. Fridge contents were free and topped up daily and extra drinks and pastries and biscuits from 2pm-1am were a bonus.  We had a room on the 2nd floor looking into the courtyard area which was nice and quiet and the beds were comfortable.

3405,"Sadly, I’m pretty sure the positive reviews for this place must be fake, because I stayed there based on the reviews and there is no way it matches the glowing descriptions. I found the place pretty outdated, the decor run down with stained carpets, etc. The pool area had a nice view of the ocean, but otherwise seemed sort of dirty and cheap quality. I couldn’t wait to check out, honestly, and so I think the only way this place is getting such glowing reviews is either if they are fake or if the people who stay at the hotel have little experience with travel and rather low standards. I would keep looking and maybe try a different reviews site that has verified bookings. ",2

Also, every time we needed to use the elevator, we had to let at least 3 of them go by, due to them being full. Also, at breakfast, 5 out of the 6 of us ordered a cooked meal, but my daughter's pre-made banana muffin didn't arrive for a full 5 minutes after our food came out - unacceptable, especially since it didn't even need to be cooked.

The five days we were there, the main elevator never worked and never saw anyone working to fix it.  Same with the hot tub.  Our door would not close without having to slam it closed.  Disruptive to those around us.  Shower door would not easily slide.  Had to ask for hangers.  CD player did not work and never did get it replaced or get the DVD player promised.   Hide-a-bed could have been used as a torture device.  Had to put the couch cushions between the wanna-be mattress and the metal frame in order to sleep.    Location was good.

When you look at the room from the outside, you think you are in a movie. When you try to sleep, you can still hear the people talk on the parking, so this means the noise is not kept outside the room. The bed however is comfortable, the shower is great. The table to work on with your laptop is very tiny and not very adapted to really work on.

As we entered our room there was an overwhelming smell of cigarettes which makes me quite ill with asthma so we returned to reception and asked for another room. They were very obliging but said it would take 20minutes as they wanted to check the new room. Not long after being in our new room we were amazed to hear intense drilling and hammering. We enquired about this on our way to have dinner and were told it would be finished by 6pm. I asked if it would be happening again the following day and was told that he didn't think so but would check and let us know (which he didn't). The noise finished well after…,2

A very nice room once it was ready. A good size room with plenty of storage space a nice big bed and large flat screen tv. A good size bathroom with shower in the bath. Breakfast was included and there was an excellent choice and friendly waiter service. We had a evening meal on the last night of our stay but were disappointed with the quality and standard of the food. The other negative of the hotel was the drink prices. 24 euros for two Bacardi and coke really did seem extortionate. Overall a nice stay but would not recommend eating or drinking there unless you have a hefty bank balance.,3

First of all, the room: I've been in much cheaper motels and got much better rooms! Beds were not your usual queen beds, they were much smaller, no refrigerator, little light and the lamps were half broken (you had to be careful when switching them on or off cause the switcher would fall) and the moquette didn't look very clean.

By a strange coincidence this was the day of Wallender's high wire walk which was taking place directly above the hotel. The manager had re-booked us into the Hyatt Regencey, Rosemont,  close to O'Hare airport so wasting the $50 shuttle cost. The Hotel manager offered $200 to cover the cost of taxi fares to and from downtown Chicago back to Rosemont, to pay for our booking at the Hyatt and to refund the charge for his hotel, although as of 3 December this has not been forthcoming.

3427,We usually put our clients up at this hotel as it is close to our office.  So I decided to stay here as I have always heard mixed opinions on this hotel.  Check in was fine.  But when I got into the room I found the ceiling was fairly low and the room overall dark. Climate control unit was extremely noisy so it made it difficult to sleep. Area is good with many food options and a park close by. I think its an ok hotel for one or two day stay.,2

3429,As a very experienced traveller Interaction with the hotel ahead of my stay indicates that this hotel is not for me... part of Marriott Platinum Premier with Ambassador benefits is Your24 which means that you Members have the flexibility to choose the 24 hours of their stay. E.g. arrive a bit earlier and checkout earlier.  My room was up graded a few months ahead of my travel but duty manager Jacob Ortiz decided not to honor the Your24 benefit by allowing me 3pm check in (1h prior to the official check in time) or to give up the room up grade.... i found it very petty. No doubt that i will not stay at this property again nor recommend others to stay at the JW Marriott SF  ,1
3430,"my husband and i just got home from sf and after staying at this hotel, i have a fever and a very swollen/sore throat and couldn’t avoid writing this review. we stayed just for the weekend and honestly, i wish we could have left a lot sooner. we prepaid for this hotel so we couldn’t cancel our reservation, but upon arriving, everything immediately felt off. keep in mind that when we arrived, i was NOT sick, not even close. when we checked in, the front desk agent gave us a different room than what we paid for and then when we asked to be moved, it seemed like we were being insulting. the room they originally placed us in was a one queen room facing the street, although i booked a double bed. the room was honestly horrifying and outdated. the windows were open and even when closed, you could hear literally everything. we moved rooms to the two beds, which was not facing the street, and it seemed okay. we weren’t thrilled but couldn’t get our money back so we decided to deal with it. this room wasn’t as bad, like the bathroom for some reason had been updated at some point in the last decade, but the bedroom was definitely “original”. there is no way to adjust the temperature in the room and apparently the central heating was supposed to turn on at some point during the night, but i don’t think it ever did. after a pretty loud and disturbing nights sleep (oh, the hotel is across the street from a hospital!), i woke up with a sore throat but chopped it up to it being cold in the room. we left for the day and came back in the late afternoon to take a nap. i woke up about an hour later with a very sore throat and a headache, not really sure what was going on, because i was fine when we were out of the hotel. we went out for dinner and came back for bed, and around 2:00 this morning, i woke up barely able to breathe or hear, everything in my face and throat was (and still is) extremely swollen. i woke up my husband and we debated leaving then and there, even considering sleeping at the airport and waiting for our 11:00 flight because i was in such bad condition. i had taken some cold and flu medicine and tried to wait it out but woke up a few hours later feeling like i was in need of medical attention. i have a very sensitive and severe mold allergy, but never in my life has my body reacted to it the way it did during our hotel stay. luckily, we left this morning and upon checking out, the front desk agent didn’t even bother to ask how our stay was, not that we had literally anything positive to report. i can’t imagine having a worse hotel experience and if you have any sort of health issue, especially a mold allergy, avoid this property at all costs. the fact that it is still operational and charging money is beyond me.   *i’d also like to note that i have worked in the hotel industry many years, additionally as a front desk agent. i know it is not the front desk agent’s fault that this property is in such poor condition, which is why we didn’t bother complaining or filing some sort of concern. the owners of this hotel should honestly be ashamed at the condition, especially for the price they’re charging. mold is an extremely visible and concerning health hazard and the hotel should attempt to fix this before someone pursues legal action.…",1

We verified with the hotel upon booking (via email so have written proof that they had a heads up!) that support animals were allowed. However, when we checked in and showed the service animal documentation, the hotel manger said he didn't care -- that if the dog barked even once he would evict us. He threw our documents at us, was impossibly rude, and told us he spread the news across the staff to keep an ear out for a dog bark so that he could evict us.

They were very friendly and welcoming.  The room - well, it was horrific. Like a flash back to the eighties. It's a VERY dated hotel and room, and it appears to have been a previous operators property and that IHG or the franchisee has just stuck the Holiday Inn logo over the previous owners logos and done nothing about the decor or fittings. The room had a strange stale odour about it, that clung to the bed sheets. I had to spray them and the pillows with aftershave in order to sleep.

Still unable to gain access so we were moved to another room.

There is an ice machine down the hall. Bye”.

Finally when he arrived we checked in and we got our room. (5 dollar fee if you lose your key card btw) We got a room with a private bathroom because we are germaphobes.

Breakfast patio needs refurbishing badly fences down you are looking at a brick wall they could put a fence up with a nice mural to look at otherwise its a bit depressing. We had a very intense droning noise on the Monday night for quite sometime apparently to do with the water on Tuesday we had no cold water until the evening. This has nothing to do with the hotel but we had some very…",3

Private pool was over chlorinated with tiles falling off. Yellow marks now on all of our swimwear. Rusty nail sticking out of the decking when I had x2 toddlers. No apology from the hotel, just took the lamp away and off they went. Kids club also poor, both kids scared of the staff and not wanting to go in the dingy room that smelt like damp. ",2
3483,"This place is small and has a funky, quirky feel. Each room is individually decorated and designed, but most look over a charming courtyard.  The hotel has a bar and restaurant downstairs which opens onto the courtyard and is perfect for people watching from early evening to late.  Acoustically sealed windows mean that you sleep well even though you are directly above the action.  It is close to 3 metro stations so you can easily get to wherever  you want in Paris and the district is close to the Gare du Nord so it is also easy to connect with the national train lines.",5

When I returned later I found out my luggage was already in my room. So was a bottle of water and some fruit and cake. I don’t know what made the room a VIP one except for being on the top floor as it’s same size as ‘normal’ one my wife had a few months back.  The room has everything you need: a safe, an ironing board, robe, slippers, most amenities, fit for a 4 star hotel. Roll in shower is big and has good water pressure.

3486,"Though not in the heart of tourist location, the hotel is conveniently located & accessible by metro, bus & tram. And less costly than similar places near la Rambla or Pl Catalunya. There are numerous eating places & shopping across the hotel in Glories mall. I walked to well known places like Torre Glories (almost next to hotel), Sagrada Familia, La Monumental etc. One quick bus ride took me to the gothic quarters & sea front. Overall, the hotel was comfortable & clean. Check in & out was efficient. I didn’t have breakfast, so cannot comment on the quality, but I  would stay here again on future visits. ",4

Elevator de Santa Justa is just round the corner, and Praço do Comércio is just a stroll away. We stayed in the the family room for 2 nights. The room feels rather cramp  with 1 double and 2 single beds. One of the single beds gives creaky sounds whenever the sleeper toss and turn. And the other single bed has dangerous metal pieces protruding out from the sides. The shower/toilet room is of a good size and works well. The hotel and room are all very arty farty.

The owner (I think he was the owner) communicated with me via email and refunded my ticket to the Arc de Triomphe because it was closed due to the terrorist act the previous day. I appreciated the personal touch by the staff and the owner.   This hotel has only 39 or so rooms and my room was quite spacious (I was surprised).

We stayed on floor 9 and the room had access to the executive Lounge on top floor where would take breakfast and supper and snacks during day. Not cheap but worth it we think. Certainly would stay here again if want a base in Berlin.... ,4

The maid entered the unit when we were about to head to skiing the next morning and was still there when I returned more than an hour later to retrieve an item. I noticed the unit was only half cleaned. We were then given a different unit while the dishwasher was being fixed. The blankets for the sofa bed in the 2nd unit were wrinkly and dirty.

The hotel is modern, the rooms are of decent size, breakfast good, plenty of food, and the location is good (within walking distance of the main tourist attractions). The wi-fi was set not to allow whatsapp calls, which really makes it useless. Now the cleanliness is a big minus. The pillows smelled horrible and the pillow cases had yellow stains. I know the eco thing, we should save the water and all, but the idea of putting my face on something that hasn't been washed the last three sets of tourists is not at all appealing.

The furniture is rather outdated, the rooms could use a redesign. The toilet smelled on cigarettes every night is if someone was smoking in it. Drinks were too expensive for the bar ambient. I had to change my key card for 3 times in two days cause it was fault. When I complained, I’ve been told - I just shouldn’t carry it in my bag... (I wonder, where else...)

Talked to front desk they can’t do anything because they can’t tell if we used it. WTAH.  Disappointed. Couldn’t connect to WIFI again front desk was no help.  Beach was nice but that’s about where my expectations stopped.  ,2

I think that not having air conditioning in the room needs to be communicated in the motel description.   Pool is small, dirty and has no seating around it.   Not one of the best beaches to visit.   I would not stay again.   ",2

When I looked at the bill I realized his error and he supposedly immediately corrected it. The next morning I looked at my bank statement and saw that I was indeed still charged for the room next door and my room. I called the hotel and they told me that they weren't able to correct it until the general manager was back on duty which is a completely unacceptable answer. This is something that should be corrected immediately as it is mishandling of customers funds and not just a complaint about breakfast or quality of room. To think that there is no way to have this handled until the general manager is back on duty is ridiculous. I even went so far as to call Hilton…",1

It was ok to get to from the airport (unfortunately the day before there was a very big storm which affected transport, so made it a little difficult to get to, but not the fault of hotel) It was easy enough to get back to the airport - just one change on the underground. On arrival we were greeted with a lovely lady - we were very early for check in and as we had young children she was able to accommodate us, which was great.

3504,We stayed at the hotel for two nights in a double queen room. You can immediately see that the hotel is past its best years. Most areas are not in a good shape. So are the rooms unfortunately. The first room we had to change because there was hair of other people everywhere and still some dirt on the ground floor. We easily got a new room but the staff didn’t apologize at all which is not acceptable in this price range. The new room was also not clean but better than the first one so we decided to stay. Everything in the room looked old and the floor plates were lose and made noise while walking in the room. A total refurbishment is overdue. A breakfast buffet was included in our room rate and this was by far the best part about the hotel. Selections were wide and we enjoyed it.…,1

Upon dining in the restaurant, service staff continued to forget items we requested, and it took well over 40 minutes to receive breakfast. Upon getting our check, it was COMPLETELY wrong. The server had to start over which took another 20 minutes.  In the evening, I had asked for change for a 50 bill; the check in couldn't help me and advised I go to the bar. The bar tender said to me ""perhaps if you ask me in another 30 minutes when I'm not busy"". Your staff look nice, but don't have sound customer service skills.",3

I stayed in a room in the 6th floor and it was quite old, with old closets and a bathroom that needs urgent renovation. The carpet in the hallway also had a funny smell, it seemed dirty to me. Breakfast is not bad and service could be a little better. They could never find our group's reservation and didn't say sorry whenever they made a mistake.

If there were any downsides is that the room is definitely a tight space (nowhere to really put luggage, closet was awkward).  Not uncomfortably so, but maybe would be if there more than a few nights. We didn't use the breakfast buffet but it looked good!

All in all, the hotel runs fine, but there is definitely no ""wow factor"" here. And for EUR 550 or over per night I just do not see how this hotel manages to justify the prices they charge. Makes me think maybe they even overcharged us... The whole hotel is outdated, decor is a la 50s, the building itself is scary and run-down from outside. Although, they make a good effort to keep up the room, it just feels so tired and outdated (deluxe room in our case). The property is not up to par to the most luxury Four Seasons out there.",3

The room was ready they just didn't inform us! Room was nice enough, very clean, comfy beds, big modern bathroom with toiletries and fluffy towels.

The location was excellent right by a metro station and tram stop so it was very easy to get to any part of Berlin with ease.  Breakfast was ok, a little crazy as everyone seems to come at once but it is included in the price of the room.  The staff were very helpful and friendly.

Room was relatively new, clean, quiet & comfortable enough; these were my basic requirements .  Location wise, it is in between Checkpoint Charlie (CC) & Topographie des Terrors (both are top sights in Mitte).  In the evening when the crowds at CC were gone,  even the street facing rooms were relatively quiet.  No problem with Wifi.

Some staff were very nice, some were quite indifferent to guests (some actually seemed annoyed to have to do their jobs, and overall for a “party hostel”, were not very inclusive or trying to engage in activities of any sort).. the “family dinner” for 8 euro seems like more money than it’s worth in terms of what you could get at a restaurant for comparable amount.. and finally the location is a pain in the butt as you have to hike up and down a very steep hill about 25 minutes into the main area so it discouraged us from adventuring out quite as much",3

Entrance to gym costs 23 EUR! In the country like Latvia this is ridiculous. Water bottle in the room costs 4,5 EUR. For a business traveller like myself, access to gym is must and it hurts to pay 23 EUR for it (just for comparison, taxi from airport is 10 EUR, dinner in very good restaurant with alcohol is less than 23 EUR, etc.).

The food was of poor quality and variety, with the same food being served nearly every night. Not all staff were friendly and approachable.

I also enjoy the good and friendly staff who are not really quick(as they do the frontdesk and bar), but quick enough to not get annoyed.",4
3543,"This hotel is very nice and if it advertised as a 4 star I would give it a much higher rating. However, the quality of mainatainace (Carpets, Tv's, tiles etc) mean it is far from this. To me it felt like a tired 4 star.The staff are very friendly and the setting is beautiful. Outdoor pool isn't heated so too cold to swim in winter. Indoor pool is small and not quite warm enough but nice. The buffet food is nice but dinner is a little repetitive even though they give it different titles. Desserts look impressive but don't live up to it.Location is lovely in terms of view but not easy to walk to places with a push chair.  Very close to the Forum shopping centre. ",3
3544,"The hotel has a different concept, keeping nature in mind. It may not be for everyone, but I liked it. Very nice and friendly staff. Minimalistic, wooden furniture and veg. food. It is not too far from the city highlights, but you will have to use some form of trasportation as it is too far to walk. On the other hand, there is a bar and restaurant district near by and and it is walkable to the Mercedes Arena.  Street car line runs near by and there is construction site across the street.",4
3545,Firstly I would like to say my rating is mostly based on the service I received in regards to asking for early check in and not in regards to the hotel in general. The hotel only cost us £8 per night so it was good value for money and the room was clean and comfortable.   I had previously emailed them before making my booking asking if it was possible to get an early check in. They replied saying they would check the availability but could I send them my booking details. I booked through Agoda and sent them all my booking details. They replied saying they had spoken to the manager and he confirmed if we cancelled our booking through Agoda and booked through the hotel directly they would grant us the early check in and upgrade our room. When trying to cancel our booking with…,2

3547,"Everything we were able to do was partly because this hotel has such an incredible location within walking distance of most of the sights you want to see and those that are not are easily accessible from the red line U-bahn whose station is right out the front door.  We travel Hilton most of the time and this is a great Hilton property.  The breakfast ares is nice and accessible.  The bar is great as well.  However, this best part is the Hilton Honors section which we visited every day to refresh after a long day.  Our room was great on the top floor exterior.  The AC was fine, the only challenge was the early 4:00 Berlin sun.  Overall it was a great experience that I could not recommend more.",5

We had 2 family rooms and 2 double rooms one of our family rooms didn't have the child bed as we arrived late we were to tired to go and enquire about it so are little boy ended up in our bed all week as it was just easier. I had requested the 3rd floor as I read reviews saying the walls were thin and if possible that all are rooms were next to each other, 3 rooms were and our room was down the hall on the 2nd floor this annoyed me as the hotel is huge and I'm sure they could accommodate us as you could tell the hotel was not full to capacity. Staying on the rooms the walls are paper thin you could hear the toilets flushing even people blowing there noses. The balconys have no privacy so if you like to…",3

It was in a different part of town than where we usually stay, but the hotel was close to many of the sites we had mapped out for our trip to Berlin this time around. Spandau is a great district and the hotel was RIGHT on the U-Bahn, which allowed us to explore during the three days that we were there.   The rooms were clean, the beds comfy, and after a long day of sightseeing, it was great to come back to a quiet room and have a great breakfast the next morning. The staff were friendly and readily answered questions and provided suggestions about what to do in the area. Being an English speaker only, staffs impeccable language skills made it pleasurable to communicate. I would definitely recommend staying here! …",4

The television was also connected to the internet. When I called the desk they said they were working on the problem. It wasn't until the very end of the day that it was fixed. That same day in the afternoon the water stopped working completely. The toilet, sinks, showers would not work.

When I went upstairs to room 339, which was my assigned room, a woman yelled at me from down the hall saying ""Did they tell you to stay in Room 339?""  I said yes.  She said ""Well, you can't stay there, come with me.""  She led me to the other end of the hallway and said I would be staying in room 357.  Note that there were 15 to 20 headboards in the hallway.

Over the years the prices have remained competitive, and the 9e for the organic breakfast buffet is now a real bargain (unless, like us, you are suffering the effect of Brexit on the £). I recommend checking out the tours offered by the hotel - often free and always interesting. And from the winelist in the restaurant, try the Grauerburgunder: like Pinot Gris/Grigio but much, much tastier.",5

Simple clean rooms, nice location to explore West Berlin next to lots of transport options, easy to get to and from Tegel airport and many restaurants of all kinds around. Internet was very good even the free WiFi (there is also a faster WiFi option for payment) No free water in room and the bottle for sale was probably the MOST expensive I've ever seen in a hotel! (even in 5 stars hotels) 5,30 euros...   Overall a very good choice especially if you can get a bargain! Breakfast could be improved though both in terms of quality and choice - but you can get a nice breakfast in one of the numerous cafes around!",4

One tramstop down Rosenthaler Stasse gets you to Hackescher Markt within strolling distance of Museum Island.  Dancers (Swing or Ballroom) will love the Ballroom on August Stasse.  Breakfast is good but a bit of a fight for seats if you leave it to 9.30.",4

This was truly the most disruptive and messy experience ever in Shanghai and at Shangri-La.  I believe this hotel MUST be removed from American Express's Fine Hotel and Resorts list as it does not meet the standard of its peers on the list, especially in Pudong ara. It feels more like a business/convention center hotel, barely keeping 4 stars with a motel style guest/front desk service. IT NEEDS A LOT OF WORK!

We were charged unauthorized charges on our card and received HORRIBLE customer service from the manager. There are far to many wonderful hotels in San Francisco to waist your time or money staying here. We won't be returning. I was actually so turned off by this I canceled my Wyndham credit card because the service at this hotel was such a turn off I no longer want to support this company.,1

My advice is to save your money on all the extra fees and stay in a condo or a hotel where the fees are less! ,2

They told me that the music and noise would stop at 10pm so I had to wait until then and if at that time it was still noisy, they would move me.  Guess what?  10:15 came around and it was still unbearably loud.  By this point I was livid.  I don’t know why I had to wait until 11pm to get a new room when I could have been moved at 8:30.

The room is nice and clean and very modern. If you get breakfast included it is very good value for money and the food is great, in a lovely dining area. I went for fruit and a croissant however there are more options, including a cooked breakfast, bacon, spanish sausage, scrambled eggs.

Also, there is a metro station and the Sloterdijk train station is not far either (very handy for the airport).  There's nothing interesting around the hotel, but the place is calm and liveable.

Upon returning and  checking in we were told they had good news and bad news. Bad news they did not have a room for us in this the hotel  but they had  secured a room in downtown San Francisco boutique hotel that was part of the Marriott brand.

I'm positive I left them in thee closet.  I wore them on Thursday night.  Checked out Friday morning without them.  I told them exactly where they were.  This left a VERY bad impression for me.

Upon check-in we had to change room 3 times in 24hrs because the room they had promised us was no longer available, even though my girlfriend (vietnamese) booked the hotel 3 weeks in advance and called to confirm 5 days before our arrival.  3. They have a water heater system that they try to keep switched off as much as possible. As I result we had 3 days of cold showers.

We can totally recommend this Hotel !  Sarah Wrobel and Pascal Thieke , Germany",5

Somewhat expensive, upscale neighborhood but lots of great restaurants.  Would stay here again. ",4

I would point out especially : the parking (with valet service), the room (very comfortable and quiet) and the Spa (with everything you need to relax after a long day of visiting Paris: Swimming pool, Hammam and Sauna).   But, this hotel offers more :  - great location : in a nice neighborhood where you are not so much in the crowd of tourists. A chance to meet with Parisians.  - an historic building fully renovated to give you a true five-stars experience without the 'bling bling' of some more famous names. A cosy nest with class and style.   Thank you to the staff for great job. We will come back. ",5
3612,Photos do not accurately depict what this hotel looks like. The twin share room that we stayed in was not clean. There was a cockroach in the corner of the bathroom when we first got there. We stayed a few nights and did not receive room servicing. Bathroom is very tiny and the hooks were placed in weird positions (hard to place a towel when it's near the bidet). The breakfast was okay but the coffee was cold. It was not the fault of the hotel but when we were at Buenos Aires there was a power shortage which resulted in cold showers.  ,2

The hotel is in an excellent location next to the central station, literally a minute’s walk away, so it was really easy for us to get on a train directly from the airport and then make our way to the hotel straight away. As our group was too large to fit in the reception, they let us use the breakfast room to sit until our rooms were all sorted and we were properly checked in. The breakfast itself was included on our trip, typical continental breakfast, you get what you pay for.

Based on reviews in general and photos on the hotel's web site, it looked like it would be just fine.  I don't know what happened, but they seem to have a wing of the hotel that is nothing like the rest of the hotel.  I am almost suspicious that these are rooms that they don't typically rent unless if it's a very busy time like this weekend was.  We had to walk all the way to the end of the building, get on a tiny scary elevator, and go up to our floor.  When we got off of the elevator, the hallway was dark and smelled of cigarettes.

Many amenities are not available (no spa, one restaurant not open, no 24hr room service) and the ones that are are incredibly sub-par at the moment.   I finished only one of three meals I ordered at the resort.    They charged me 35% more than the online rate to stay an extra night and refused to honour the online rate.  Strange.   The pool and the beach are very well maintained and make up for the absent amenities and lack of service.  The staff were very friendly and tried there best to help.

Our room, with a king-size bed, was clean and fairly spacious, with a very nice window view of the River Ij, looking out towards the Central, which is the hub for train and public transportation for Amsterdam and well within walking distance of the Movenpick.

The rooms allocated were tiny (rooms 31 and 35) and all were inclined so much so you have the impression of drunkenness!!!!! Staff are very cheerful and efficient and handled other employees slight tardiness by arriving late for duty very well. Location is no doubt the winning point with this hotel. Very close to Vondel Park and the main drag where partying for the Kings birthday occurred.. Rooms were clean albeit a bit noisy on Kings day despite the double glazing. Breakfast were simple but had all the necessary ingredients. Boiled eggs, toast, yoghurt, croissant coffee, cereal etc, etc, etc. I would have easily given this hotel a 3.75 ou of 5.

I enjoyed going to the jacuzzi at night after long walks in the city. If I were to visit Berlin again, this hotel would definitely be an option. ",4

Our room actually had a hole in the bathroom wall and the shower was dirty.  We also had bugs in our bed and I went home with bites on my ankles.  This hotel is located right on the beach in Leblon, which is a more hip, less touristy part of Rio.  However, most of the best restaurants and nightclubs are outside of Leblon, so our taxi bills really added up.   We reserved a basic room on Expedia.  We asked about upgrading to deluxe room, but the improvement was not worth the extra $150/night.  Beware, the hotel told me that the rate I paid on Expedia was more than their rack rate (booking directly through the hotel). ",2

There is a shopping mall located just next to the hotel and there are plenty of restaurants as soon as you cross the road to the other side. apart from that it about  a 10 to 15 mins walk from the hotel to the beach. Rooms are very spacious. most importantly there front office staff are very friendly and very helpful. breakfast is also very good and has a good spread. from the hotel it will cost you 15 Euros to go to the city center. also there is a hop on hop off bus stop just next to the hotel.,4
3671,"My visit was for my son's wedding. I had called several times to book 3 rooms. Was told each time we had a ""cityview room with sofa bed "". After waiting until 3pm to check in , which by the way I asked for early check in and was confirmed it would be okay,, room was not what was booked. My grandchildren were to spend the night with us and no sofa bed. Called to complain, was put on hold twice and finally talked to a manager who told me there was no cityview room with a sofa bed. I was very upset,,  she Offered to Cancel my reservation and find us another hotel 3 hours before the wedding!!! WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!! This was in addition to parking issues, and a breakfast buffet that had 4 items on it. WORST STAY AT A MARRIOTT PROPERTY!!!",1
3672,"I am staying in this hotel currently. I have been in a lot of hotels in Shanghai, I come here every 3 months.   This hotel is well located if you have an early train. If not, don't go there, it's really complicated to get out of that north station square.   My room is humid, smells of humidity, and I have that feeling like even the bedsheets and bathroom towels are sort of humid.   The internet is extremely slow and wireless rarely works in the rooms. It works perfectly fine in the lobby, but you'll only get a wired connection in the rooms most of the time.   What is the worse in this hotel is the breakfast. That is REALLY far from the Holiday Inn standards. You'll see that there are lots and lots of foreigners in this hotel so you'll think the breakfast must be quite…",2
3673,Electronic door broke or the battery died.  Couldn't get in the room for 20+ minutes while waiting to go to the airport.  Some staff showed a less than positive attitude to fixing the problem.  Tried to talk their way out of it showing up and giving me access.,1
3674,"Had it not been for some of the staff I would have rated this hotel much higher.  The room was nice, very large and with a lovely view of the sea.  There are also a couple of nice pools and well equipped gym.  For me the highlight would have been the yoga shala - which I was able to use a couple of time as a result of some yoga classes, including private classes.    However this leads on to one of my issues with the staff.  One morning when as I asked about the use of the shala to do some yoga I was told it was only open for set classes or hire.  When I then enquired about hiring it I was told that I would have to wait until later in the day when the manager was back.  The issue was though how all of this was conveyed to me - all in a very rude, abrupt and unpleasant way.  I had…",3

The thing I liked least about the room is toilet and shower-  they are 2 very small rooms with sink between them.  Breakfast selection was small , but with fresh fruits. So - if you're not paying over 100 €/per night, then it's very good choice. To pay more - it's not worth it.",3

The room was ok, we asked for a double golf view but were advised that room 228 was an upgrade. It had 2 small double beds, this is the first time we have slept in separate beds on a holiday.  There was no change of changing our room til the Thursday at earliest... The room was ok but felt cold, we put the heating up to warm us up.  Whilst the weather was dreadful at least we were staying in a five star hotel.

Secondly ""atrocious dining staff"" who are so racist that they were greeting anybody with fair skin.. They made faces when we order eggs per out choice ..& also showed half heartedness to serve tea on our table& No sign of smile for us.

3679,"The hotel is a bit out of date and not terribly central. It is walkable to city center, but only if you are up for quite a long stroll. I did it but it takes some time. The hotel is a bit dated and needs some work. They are working on some things as the lobby bar was just renovated and does look quite sharp. The rooms are nothing special and the unbelievably tiny windows make it feel like a prison cell. I had two different rooms and the second had a broken window that wouldn't close. With the planes flying quite low overhead on approach to the airport, it was not very quiet! One very unpleasant episode was the housekeeper barging into the room not once but twice! She knocked and then immediately opened the door. It was midday and she likely assumed no one was in the room. This…",3
3680,"Very disappointed. Check in was slow, and receptionist who checked us in was rude and unhelpful. None of the staff including (restaurant staff) seemed very happy to be there, which made us feel uncomfortable and unwelcome and the place had no real atmosphere. No robes were provided in our room, we had to go down to reception and ask for them. The following morning, there was a note under our door at 10am stating that as we had the Do Not Disturb sign on the door, our room would not be cleaned that day. Again another trip down to reception - never had this at a hotel before. If it had been lunchtime onwards we would have understood but this seemed silly.   The shower flooded the bathroom, so we were having to lay hand towels on the floor each time we took a shower.   We went down…",2

Location not in touristic highlights area, but near a major Metro station and very good. Hotel parking close and suitable for leaving the rented car, and using public transport.",3
3683,"My husband and I stayed here for four days and thoroughly enjoyed it. The rooms are a good size, although the bed is particularly small. In comparison to other hotels when asked for a king size bed the one we received was definitely no bigger than a double size bed. That aside the hotel is very nice, model and unique with free wifi a small gym (adequate for travel) and a lovely rooftop and bar area. I strongly recommend you make a trip to the rooftop for a cocktail. It is a good location for shopping but for most tourist sits you will need a bus tour or cab. Overall a nice hotel.",4
3684,"We only had one night here and j wish it was more! The staff was so welcoming and kind. We had to catch an early flight and miss breakfast and the concierge sounded truly heartbroken that we didn't get our included breakfast. Excellent location, walking distance to Eiffel tower and across from a metro. The room was lovely and spacious. Also loved the lobby and the friendly kitty. ",5
3685,"The hotel is located in the heart of the shopping street and bars. It is very convenient especially if you just want to walk around Cannes and not take public transportation. The staff is amazing, they are very hospitable and friendly. The receptionist is multi lingual (she is originally from Philippines) helped out in where to park and the best times to park. The parking is free after 6pm til 8am, after that its 3euros every 2 hours. The room is clean, the coffee, water and juices are refilled everyday. The bathrooms are refilled as well (Clarins shampoo, shower gel and lotion). The best part of all is free breakfast. The waiter remembers your drink which is awesome like starbucks. Overall, I am satisfied with our stay and would definitely recommend to family and friends.",5

It is located in a beautiful neighborhood near the Eiffel Tower (10-15min) walk and I felt very safe as they manage the people walking in and out of the hotel at night.  Loved it and would come again!",5

He told me he'd check it out and call me back. Never did. So I called back (3 days later) and spoke with someone else. Never heard from him again either. Then I called back and spoke with a loss prevention manager. He claimed to check the lost and found and did not find my flat iron, he said to file a claim I would have to speak with his boss. Well, his boss never called me back. So today I called and asked for the hotel manager, and was told that he or she didn't take complaints about loss prevention. Then they sent me to housekeeping to speak with a manager and she told me to call back tomorrow to speak…",1

Instead, you'll be checking in at a tiny lobby on the ground floor, then walk outside to another entrance, take an elevator at an external staircase and walk along hallways that have doors to student apartments. To me all of it looked a bit awkward. Finally at the room, eventually learn to disregard everything outside. The room was basic but tidy with a little cooking nook, refrigerator and microwave oven. Just like a basic studio. Breakfast was at the mall at a restaurant. It was a buffet with very good choices. Just a bit far from your room, that's all. Overall, this is a decent and affordable place but it certainly doesn't feel like…",3

They did change my room from the 3rd floor to the 1st floor, but I think it was because I walk with a cane, not because it was an upgrade.  Asked for the box of chocolates as promised in the senior promotion, was told it would be sent to the room (still waiting).  Parking lot was full by 5:30 and we were affraid to leave the hotel thinking there would be no place to park when we got back.",2
3693,"Hostel lacked any type of atmosphere, everyone in our dorm was above the age of 40 which was a little odd. The bathroom in the dorm room was always dirty and the bin was never emptied, just overflowing on the floor. They need a communal kitchen so people can cook their own meals as the city is too expensive to expect people to eat in restaurants. The hostel offers breakfast but it’s out of the price range for anyone who is actually backpacking. ",3

The room was at sea-side and is probably one of the best from the perspective of noise pollution from nearby construction sites, regarding the sea view, you could see the sea in a distance between some high risers. Room was ok but It was the many small things that was buggering, cleaning was so-so, one day they forgot to give us toilet-paper, bathroom door was not possible to close, safe was not working properly, bed was not very comfortable (ok last is subjective).

No direct line to housekeeping staff, no on site restaurant or bar. All requests and dining options were directed and handled by the next door Indigo Hotel. Seems it would have been more convenient just to stay there considering both are part or IHG group. Even in order to get some wine glasses we were told to go to the other hotel. Also hotel has no designated parking. There is street parking and a garage within a 5 min walk. Both options run about 24 euros per day.

A great location for sightseeing, getting about the city, restaurants, shopping and it is also close to the train station for day trips to Sintra/Cascais.  All the front of house staff were friendly, helpful and very welcoming.  The hotel was clean and fresh with trendy décor and we loved the design.  The breakfasts were fantastic and the dining area modern and bright.  The only drawback, and we would say it was significant, was the size of our room.

Also the room service did not match the quality of the food from what I saw in the restaurant on the terrace. Sadly due to the quality of room service we didn’t book the restaurant. But wish I had!

A charge to use the internet - in this day and age! Damp smelling bathroom. Half the channels on the TV didn't have any picture just sound (and no they weren't radio stations!).

Couldn't get back to sleep again afterwards and the other odd noises resumed. It must be the mechanical engineering centre of the hotel.  I complained in the morning when we went down to breakfast, and I think the reception staff know all about this room.

The lodge room was large and comfortable but bland and lifeless.  Dark furnishings, little light from the window and ancient heating and air con system rumbling away trying to keep the room warm.

It was so bad that I went up to the bar myself two days in a row to put an order in. If I wanted to take care of myself, I would have booked an Airbnb down the street.

First of all they had promised us a pick-up but no one was waiting at the airport (which in the end turned out to be an advantage, since the hotel charges more for the transport than normal taxis). Secondly, they gave us a room on the 1st floor overlooking the street, though we had explicitely asked for a very quiet room in advance. They first pretended not to have another room available, however we eventually could swith rooms - but we had to take the towels from the other room with us and put fresh linens on the beds (nobody helped us).

We ordered breakfast for the room at a cost of 8 Euros which turned up earlier than planned and did not contain butter for the barely toasted bread. The waiter indicated that we had not ordered butter (surely standard when ordering toast????) and promptly went…",3

3733,"Experienced a very flat faced hospitality here. Was expecting a lot better. Room was ok, the view from the room assigned was not good. Despite the property not having sold out and prior request of airport side view, was not given. Shower could have been a lot better, property is getting a bit run down lately. Property includes the airport drop in the room rate, which is not required for a business traveller like myself. They could have instead included breakfast / meal instead. No welcome drink etc upon check-in. Check in was very very flat faced. FOE could have been a lot more cheerful. Room service menu choices are limited, rates expansive. Sleep quality was pathetic. Overall just about ok. I am sure better VFM propositions are avalable in the Aerocity locality.",2
3734,"I booked a room in advance purchase and had to cancel.  Due to my travels, this occurs on rare occasion however the hotel manager has always reimbursed the room charge.  Today Flor Torres refused to refund a $270/night stay.  It is of extreme disappointment to me that Marriott would do this to a loyal member.  I'm not a huge traveler compared to others, but I stay about 60 nights/year in Marriott.  To add insult to injury, I have no receipt to show this, it's not even listed in my portal on the Marriott website, plus where are my points if I'm paying for the room?  It would be nice if Marriott would review their policies.",1
3735,We received a fantastic service when we all checked in from Claire and Mary. They were very helpful in every way. Thanks guys.  Complimentary pastries and cold water in reception!!!! Just what you need when you have walked with a suitcase for 20 mins in the sun.,5
3736,"This stay was only for one night as we decided to stay after my husband's unit Christmas party. Room was ok, it was clean and updated but nothing spectacular. They provide ear plugs as the street noise gets very loud. We did forget my husband's electric toothbrush, which we remember right away (we live 20 mins from the hotel by Pearl Harbor side) but they did not even put the effort into looking into it. I am pretty sure someone took it home instead of turning it in. Very disappointing. Shoulda just spent that extra $20 to stay at the Sheraton or Modern. ",2

Front desk people were nice but I don’t think they empathize with their guest at not getting a room at 5pm! What’s the standard ck in time ya? Room is poorly maintained. Got a tile that is loose in the bedroom and the impression I got from the state of the room is that it is overused. Housekeeping staffs were pretty nice. That’s the best part of my stay. Smile and tried their best to communicate. But their work on the cleanliness of the room still needs abit of work. Steak from the room service was top notch!

3738,"We had stayed as a family at the area of the Republic before, and we really liked it. So when my wife and I decided to go back just us two, we looked for a cheaper option, but still in the area. The IBIS was a good choice as it gave us everything we needed, and nothing more. I say this like that, as when you get more then you need, you normally end up paying for it. The hotel is very cost effective (It was about 50 Euro's a night) on room only basis. The rooms are small, but big enough, with comfortable beds and a modern shower room (no bath, but then we never like hotel baths). The room was clean, it didnt have a safe but one was given to us downstairs at no cost - even better as if a hotel has to dish out 200 safes, that cost is rolled onto the guests.    Location wise -…",5
3739,"We enjoyed our one night stay in the NH Amsterdam Centre, well located just outside the ‘ring’, close to Leidesplein and an easy walk to the Museum Quarter.  It claims a four star rating but we would grade it three star plus except for the price – but this is Amsterdam!).   Our room was 'compact' and somewhat ‘tired’ but it was well-equipped and everything worked.  Some noise drifted in to though our canal-facing window overnight (Leidesplein revelry?)  Breakfast was a well-stocked buffet in a canteen-like atmosphere.  All the staff we met were pleasant and helpful.  WiFi is free and simple to use but rather slow.    There’s nothing exceptional about this typical NH hotel but we grede it a marginal 4/5 and it's an acceptable base for a short stay.  Dining tip - Jaspers, about…",3

Room service takes a long time to get your order (sometimes upward of 30 minutes for beers) and the phone line in the room was very bad. Location is very close to the beach. Breakfast is ok as well as the lunch and dinner menus. Secure parking space is available as well for guests, you will just have to ask the hotel to take it in.",2
3741,"This is a great hotel, recently renovated with modern furniture and amenities. Yes, it is located off the Croisette, but you walk anywhere anyway. The bed is ridiculously big even for 2 adults. The breakfast buffet is basic, but the menu is the same every day... I’d like the option to variate my nutrition over a week’s stay. They also have a beach side restaurant - Gray d’Albion Plage which is great for lunches, though the beach is not in the best shape.  However, my personal favorite part of my stay was Olivier - the Concierge. We clicked from the first moment. He happened to be in the lobby almost every day and always gave me great directions. On the first night he even escorted me via a shortcut to my event. Then, on my birthday along with his team, he sent me a little gift…",5
3742,"As with so many other reviews of this hotel, the story is it's in a great location, close to the airport, and there are some good points and some poor points about the hotel itself.  Machico is a really pleasant town and the views from the hotel are lovely.  The room was clean and comfortable, with a great shower.   But the rest of the hotel is so ripe for refurbishment - it has some great spaces that could look better and be better used.  And the breakfast was disappointing - automatic machine coffee, tinned peaches rather than fresh fruit salad.  Service was variable - a little grumpy at times.  It was good for our one night stay straight off the aeroplane, but probably not a destination hotel in itself.",3
3743,"Excellent location - within walking distance to the centre of Berlin and close to the metro, not to mention a 5 minute walk from Checkpoint Charlie.   The staff were very friendly and helpful, the rooms were basic but clean and comfortable and the hotel felt safe.    We didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel, as we were only in Berlin for a weekend and had a lot to cram in, but the hotel was exactly what we were looking for: clean, comfortable, safe and central - all without breaking the bank!  I would thoroughly recommend it!",4
3744,"So this is the final stop on my journey through Europe, and wanted to spend a lot of time exploring Berlin.  I drove in, but for this spot, you can get just about anywhere quickly using mass transit from right outside the hotel! Talk with the concierge for any details you'd need on exploring!  I spent the week in one of the Superior Suites with Exec Lounge access, and this is a decision I very, very much do not regret at all.  The service I got here was probably the best in almost all of the 5 Star places we stayed at, and surpassed in some aspects.   The 'room' was absolutely HUGE. More like a 1 BR apartment with 1.5 baths here in the US.   Room service was EXTREMELY prompt, and always eager to help! Even the cleaning staff had a bit of fun, which is something I love when…",5

Every evening and at nights when it's VERY cold, they turn the heating off (lonely ancient heater stands in the corner of the room) and explain it by ""it's been a hot day"". It wasn't hot day anyway, I call reception again. Their reply: ""We'll turn it on at 9pm"". 9pm. Still no heat and it's getting freezing in the room. Had to call 3 times in a row, same excuse. Downstairs guest toilet is in the basement and was broken all the time. Bathroom in the room was broken, too and the sink was so small I could not wash properly. For the price you pay, it's a rip off. They just don't care, when you ask for help. All night there are garbage trucks smashing bottles downstairs.",1

Down the street from the station. 10 minute walk to the park and river cruise. 15 minutes from the airport. Located in a nice neighborhood - far away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist.. I have already recommend this hotel to friends. On my list of hotel keeper.  ,5

When we arrived (1am) the night porter wasn't very friendly and didn't say much.  Our room was ok, clean and tidy. The air con was amazing (we really needed it with the hot weather) but we were disappointed with the size of the balcony and in hind sight should have booked a sea view room which had larger balconies at the front of the hotel.

Crowne Plaza next door but otherwise little that was tourist related. No bars or restaurants close by. There is a metro station up the road for access into the town centre although we didn't use it. Hotel is well appointed with three efficient lifts. All staff found to be polite and efficient. Large rooms  with very nice bathroom area. Tea and coffee making facilities but strangely enough we were never left any milk! Good selection of food at the self service breakfast.

We were given a room on the 10th floor with lovely views over the perfume river.  On the first night we struggled to sleep as we couldn't get the aircon below 23 degrees.  We reported this to reception the following day who quickly sent someone to our room but they could not understand what I required.  A second person was sent who explained I would have to wait 40 minutes but eventually the temp would come down to the required 19 degrees.

I had a lot of ants on the wood just above my bed. Towels had stain marks. The only savings grace is the location which is right next to the beach.

The airconditioning in the sitting room, when switched for about 10 minutes, would emit a sourish funky smell through the air vents. We would end up not keeping the airconditioning on due to the funky smells.  The Hotel unfortunately do not offer any standby air purifier for guests.

The Royal Orchid, Rocamar and Cais da Oliveira are a complex of hotels which work together, however the accommodation, shared facilities and restaurants are connected in peculiar ways. For instance in the Royal Orchid the lift stops between the floors rather than at them. So carrying your suitcases, you climb up (or down) 10 marble steps from reception to reach the lift (already having just climbed steps from the road to reception) and then you do exactly the same when you get to your own floor.

The double shower is a nice touch, although we didn't use this feature (as I was traveling with my mother this time) but maybe newly weds will highly appreciate it ... …",4
3789,No customer service  Tiny room Poor facilities  Wouldn't stay again  Only positive is the distance and ease to get to shops with uber or public transport Restaurant was never open when we wanted to eat there Front desk staff could barley speak English and we were over charged for a roll out bed and had to ring to have them refund it  ,1
3790,"I was here for a conference in December, the rooms are totally ok, nothing fancy. The shower head should have a proper cleaning since it had calcium deposits.   The breakfast was great, one of the best I have been to. A lot of options and a big area. ",3
3791,"This hotel,is a delight.It is well situated near the Invalides,and the 'hop on hop off' tour bus. Rooms are well equipped with a mini bar where the first drop in is free! All other drinks 4 euros. There is also a very relaxed bar area on the ground floor behind the reception which is open 24 hours. I can highly recommend this hotel.Very friendly staff. Breakfast is excellent -more than 'continental'",5
3792,"Lovely place to stay, very peaceful that you can forget you are in one of the major European capitals. Excellent transport into the center right outside the front door. Breakfast was superb with fresh produce and something to fit all tastes, and more. Al the staff were very helpful sorting out any issues straight away.",5
3793,"Hotel had a good rating on wotif but did not meet expectations. Noisy and poor cleaning standards.  Had frequent problems with the key card system too.  Hotel requires a revamp.  On the plus side, the room had a little kitchen. ",2
3794,"Was in town for a conference, the only redeeming feature of this hotel is its location.  From a UK traveler's perspective, a very badly maintained, bygone Edwardian hotel located in the middle of downtown Chicago just doesn't work.  Main issues are:  1) The concept of customer service doesn't exist in this hotel - the only exception is at the hotel restaurant - suspecting the power of tips is at play.  Other than that, do not expect helpful or friendly staff.  Want to grab a taxi - use uber, there wont be any valet to help you.  Take the luggage to the room yourself - porters MIA.  Reception staff - poker face upon check in/out.  Same day dry cleaning - only on paper.  2) Room - so outdated and old.  Hot water is luke warm at best, I was unlucky enough to get put in a room that…",1
3795,"We were able to check in early after a long flight series so that was outstanding. The front desk was incredible and we even upgraded our rooms to the apartments. It is very boutique and trendy. Great music playing in the lobby. Clean and welcoming rooms. Great views from the open windows. I never used the air conditioning since the weather was wonderful and I was excited to have windows that opened. Just before 2200, there was a guy that sang opera across the street on his doorstep. It was awesome! Breakfast is a really great choice for a tired traveler. The rooftop bar wasn't always opened but they have a bar on the ground floor that opens during bad weather.  Irly (I'm sure I spelled that wrong but he's from the Ukraine) at the front desk was amazing! He recommended our…",5

3797,"The hostel itself is lovely, staff is friendly and nice. It’s clean, and cosy. HOWEVER, I find it unforgivable that a man was placed in our room after paying for an all female dorm. My friend complained and warned an employee not to do this again. Yet my other friend who stayed extra days there, informed me that this happened AGAIN.  When she complained, they told her it was a mixed room. I have it on my receipt that it was all female, so this is clearly a lie.  Just a warning: you never know what trauma an individual has been through in their personal life. So when they ask for a single sex dormitory, give it to them!!",3
3798,"This hotel just blew us away! The responsiveness of the staff from start to finish was amazing.  Shout out to the staff Leo and especially Karim who was not only very responsive and accommodating, he definitely served us with sincere kindness.  My husband sprained his ankle and At 2 am, Karim connected us to get medical advice and gave us all the first aid items we need to alleviate my husband’s pain.  We are certainly staying here again, highly recommended!",5
3799,"Had a lovely stay at Corendon happy that the spa was only 15 Euro for the whole stay we used many times kept very clean couple of complaints our room carpet had more than a few stains on it and around the bath tub was mouldy , also great choice of snacks food at the bazaar although one day we waited almost 25 minuets for a cheese and ham toastie I think there should be more than one member of staff at the bazaar one staff member served us then took food up to a different room and didn’t let us know we didn’t know if he was coming back or not . Other than that it’s a lovely hotel very peaceful thanks !",3
3800,"Nice room and location, but I find it bizarre the way the staff totally ignores the Do not Disturb light on the door. Came in on us not once, not twice, but 3 times in our first day here. Twice without knocking, and once while we were still in bed. I double checked and the light was definitely on each time. They just ignore it. As of the writing of this review on our second morning, they again came in without knocking at 8am while we were still in bed.   Maybe i'm nit-picking, but its just not something i've seen before in a 5 star hotel nor am I comfortable with it. I thought the transparent wall to the shower was cute until I realized that strangers are apparently going to coming walking in un-announced!  An extra note that is less of a big deal, the ""hamburger mania"" they…",2

The hotel is situated in a very central location and nothing is too much trouble for the staff.  I will be returning.",5
3802,"This place is just ridiculous. DO NOT consider staying here if you are planning to go to Buenos Aires. The city is great, so don't ruin the trip by staying at this hotel.  When we arrived, we were given a room in one of the two wings of the hotel. It was in a terrible condition: the carpet was stained, the bathroom would be considered tacky even in the 70's and there was no furniture besides the beds and a TV... But what truly was unbelievable was the door: not only did it NOT lock, as the door handle came out and it was thus unusable. It was just unacceptable and no one could give it 4 stars. We called the front desk and they told us there weren't any rooms left (it was a busy weekend) but they would give as a suite the next day. We accepted, and somehow managed to get some…",2

We've been told regarding extra charges for upgrades, has been agreed, & here we are! Unfortunately, hotel doesn't meet 5 star standard. Room wasn't really clean( it was even dust on the clothes hangers, balconies chairs & table also were dusting). Next day it was my daughter's birthday , we went to the tour,& when we came back- were unpleasantly surprised. Pillows from the bed were laying on the floor between beds!!! The bedding in the room wasn't changed; we contacted reception & been apologized,& told that…",3
3804,We have just come back from 3 nights this lovely family run Hotel and missing it already! Everyone made us feel so welcome and nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast in the garden was wonderful and the freshly picked figs a real bonus. The location was perfect being less than 5 mins walk to the bars and restaurants in the Old Town and the same distance to the beach. The pool was so refreshing at the end of the day and the pool side bar service an unexpected bonus.  Thank you for making our family trip so memorable - we will be back.,5
3805,"A recently refurbished hotel with small but very well equipped rooms, stylish and very comfortable beds. It's not so much the room that's small but the shower room and toilet. Free wi-fi. The staff were always on hand and very friendly and helpful. Great location being only a few minutes walk from La Republique and easy access everywhere from there. Very quiet street. Supermarkets and great restaurants nearby too. We had no complaints. A great find considering previous experiences at budget/small hotels in Paris.",5
3806,I have stayed in Grand Mercure at least 3 times since it's opening. I have seen when it was opened until a few years since opening. This hotel is on nice location facing the river so it has a nice view. It also sits on an end of the street so the area is quite and only 5 minutes from the airport so access from and back to the Airport is quite easy. The staff are friendly and it has a nice lobby with nice room sizes. But the wifi in the hotel is ok for basic needs such as downloading emails and doing chats but when you have a big file in the email it takes a while to download and doing business conference such as webex or skype video its very bad and doesn't work. Also the TV in the room the channels are very poor and the quality is bad and has not interactive TV for a modern…,2

3808,"Here it is.  They say they offer a hot breakfast and they dont.  They offer a micowaved Jimm Dean sandwich.  I understand that they are going through a renovation but then why dont they say something on their website before you book.  Its deceptive so say the least.  Over $200 a night and they give you a Jimmy Dean microwaved sandwich.    And I realize they will respond with the whole ""Medditeranean options this summer"", but why would I go back to a hotel that just screwed me over??  Stay away!!  There is an Aloft and Fairfield next door that will give you the same great location without the false advertising.",1
3809,Vue bar very disappointing. Not really classy I’d even say vulgar as many prostitues are hanging around trying to catch someone for the night. Champagne served into plastic glasses. Bartender didn’t even want to give us a glass of water to have a medicine.  Watch out light on the bund turn off at 11pm so it’s useless to get there to have a blurry view of the bund (even if it’s not the hotel fault there).  Entrance fee: 110¥ with a glass included ,2
3810,"We have spent our Christmas & New Year holiday with Enotel Quinta do Sol. Our experience overall was good. The staff is very pleasant. Overall the hotel is good. If you're looking for luxury, this is not the place to be.  Breakfast every morning should be switched up as every day it is the same. 7am -10am. Hotel is located in a great place , walking distance to Lido and Funchal Centro.   Over all the experience was good. But don't think we will be returning so soon. It was worth the visit.  ",3
3811,"The location of hotel is central & easy to walk out of front door & explore. Easy to get around from there.  The room was rather small with little shelf space to unpack items. There is a safe & small refrig in room. Not unexpectedly, no face towels at all.   We ordered lunch (club sandwich) at hotel. We were on a time schedule, so we were limited. We had wait 35 minutes for food-we asked twice if it was coming, at all.  Once we were served, the food was good-sandwich & tomato soup was lovely, but we had to rush to eat before our tour began. We only had 1 hour to eat & refresh before the next tour started. ",3

Order TMB travel card on line to get discount - 3 days is for 72  hours from first use.

The hotel's lobby and breakfast room are decorated in a Nantucket style with plenty of light. The entire hotel is air-conditioned, clean, and well maintained.

The views are fantastic from the main, large dining area and pool.  However, our room was very dated and tired. The king bed was like concrete hard but the hotel quickly fixed it with a mattress topper. The blow dryer did not work but they provided a portable one for our stay.  Shower is leaking through the wall and water damage evident every day on the hall carpet floor.  All the carpets in the hallways have a strange marking, like they’ve had serious water damage.

The metro stations nearby where on lines of places we wanted to go, and the ""big bus"" had a stop not too far away.  Many things (Galleries Lafayette, Moulin Rouge, Opera, etc) all in short walking distance.  We paid for an upgraded room, so by Paris standard it was VERY large.  Staff were helpful.  If you didn't want to have breakfast in the hotel, there were plenty of cafes nearby.  We even found laundry nearby that was very clean and a high standard.  Rue de Athenes is a nice quiet street.    The only downside was cigarette smoke that wafted in if we left the windows open.",5

Not wanting to be problematic, we replied ""No need, just give it a spin in the blender and it'll be fine"".

Since the room was a rare room and it was facing the wall of the adjacent building, we had nature photographs screened on the next building wall at night, so we will not be too bored with just a building wall.

Rooms smell very old and musky. We were very cold throughout the stay so put the heating and and just smelt like burning the whole time. Curtains didn’t close. The noise of the housekeeping was unbearable and we were woken up constantly. The lock on the room didn’t work. Dust everywhere including bathrooms.Only positive was that the bed was comfortable.

(Was great for just me, would have been a little tight had my husband come along--especially the shower which measures less than 1m square.)  I took the RER from CDG for only  €10.50.  It stops at ""Luxembourg"" then you have a quick, 5-minute walk to Hôtel Sorbonne.

When we talked to Hilton guest services, they confirmed that it was cancelled, but could do nothing about the charge - that needed to be handled by the site management.

Sleep quality was good with large beds and soft pillows. The only thing to note is that some of the doors in the hotel are a little noisy - even when closed, some of them make a 'juddering' noise which can be quite loud. This is possibly caused by the wind or when other doors are opened / closed.   The staff were extremely helpful and corteous throughout. Overall I was very happy with this hotel.",3

We knew Santorini is expensive but we have stayed in other hotels on the same week with higher quality amenities for lower prices, right next to Fira so we would dispute that the price of this hotel is quite steep.   The reception staff were lovely and friendly and the bed was comfy and our room was cleaned every day.   We had a good stay but felt a little overcharged for what we got, sadly.   ",3
3847,"The customer service was horrible. Hermes was tebbible at the front the parking was very expensive a day at the hotel and as hot as it is there the hotel does not supply water, not even a water fountain",1
3848,"The room quality is old and the maintenance and upkeep of hotel is quite shabby. Bedsheets also had stains. It is marginally cheaper then the city suites, however, it is worth considering. Staff can be friendlier and the hotel is 45 mins from airport.",2

3850,"After collecting car from airport, had great difficulty finding the hotel, despite stopping to ask several times. This was partly due to one way systems & no sign at entrance to the complex of 3 hotels on site. Long way up a steep drive to Mimosa. Room on 6th floor, great view from balcony, sea one side & mountains the other, Unfortunately hit an unusually bad spell of weather, so was glad to use the indoor pool & sauna. Breakfast was perfectly adequate, though lack of fresh fruit was a disappointment, though after speaking to very helpful gentleman at reception, we had local bananas the day after I mentioned this to him. Satisfied with room, if basic, cleanliness & friendliness of staff. Lots of good restaurants in the area, but not recommended to anyone with mobility problems…",3
3851,"I stayed here for almost a week a few years ago and really loved the hotel.  Decided to return with my wife and it just wasn’t the same.  Admittedly we booked late, but the rate we paid for the room was very high for what we got. A small room at the front of the hotel, up some stairs and past some mops and floor brushes left in the corridor. The double bed was just two singles pushed together.  The room was very clean and quiet.  Breakfast was another disappointment. No bacon, no mushrooms, dried up beans and dried up eggs. The waitress said they had run out of bacon, and that mushrooms were on the way. We never saw them. For €15 (€20 if we hadn’t booked breakfast in advance) this wasn’t worth the money.  I’d go elsewhere next time.",3

3853,"Luckily, this stay was paid for already, but I would never actually choose to stay here. The staff were wonderful, so it was not an issue of them at all. To start, the bed was terribly uncomfortable. Sure I like my own bed more, but I thought we were beyond 1980s spring mattresses. Floor was super dirty and grimy so I made a ""safe"" pathway with towels. It was also small so beware of that bothers you (didn't really bother me much). There was no microwave which I guess I took for granted other places (I like to make popcorn when away from home). And lastly was charged a fun surprise fee that I haven't figured out yet-always my favorite when checking out of rooms. ",1
3854,"When choosing a Paris location for our hotel, we saw  this property close to the train station.  It is only a brief walk across the street. The restaurants next to the hotel offer reasonable breakfast items. Having a metro stop so close was a definite convenience.  The staff could not be more helpful with directions and making us feel comfortable until our room was ready. They were all genuinely friendly with excellent communication skills. I would highly recommend Hotel Terminus Lyon for a future stay.",5
3855,"Just spent 2 weeks here on business. Had emailed ahead a week before asking for early check in as I was arriving early and had to go straight to a meeting. No acknowledgement and no room ready when I turned up. Stayed here before. My room was ok if a bit dull in terms of decor. Clean linen every day and good showers. Breakfast buffet adequate. Wi if not the fastest. Most of the staff were very helpful but for a business type hotel not that many English speakers. Location is good for nearby businesses. There is a shopping centre and a large Carrefour within 10 minutes. Have to say Sao Paolo not the most interesting or appealing place to visit, I was bored out of my head every weekend. One tip is to allow plenty of time to get to the airport as the traffic can be horrendous.",2
3856,"I'm disappointed at both our stay at this hotel (See my friend's review from 2 weeks ago) and how the hotel responded to her 2 star review.    On the night of the check-in, I was told that even though my name was on the reservation, I could not redeem the points so had to put down a hefty deposit - due to potential fraud.  My husband (Marriott platinum member who made the reservation, with my name on the reservation) called the hotel, spoke Chinese to the receptionist, asked to talk to a manager at this point he was told the manager only spoke English.  This was a terrible way for the receptionist to try to make him ""go away"".  My husband then said he was comfortable speaking English.  This time he got to talked to a Chinese-speaking manager!  He then was re-directed to member…",2

3858,"This hotel sells itself as bijou. It is not shabby chic it is just shabby. Our room had half a window ( half obscured by the extremely noisy air conditioning unit. The room resembled a dreary cell with a light about a metre wide at least suspended over the bed with debris visible through the 'drum' skin. The colours we're dark, depressing and looked as though they were applied by children. There was no mirror in the room, only in the bathroom.  The lobby had bikes leaning against a pillar and a dish of water for passing dogs!  Although advertised as having coffee making facilities in the room, we had to complain and eventually were given a kettle. The only coffee making facility available for everyone was cups and coffee in the morning in the lobby. The staff seemed overworked…",1
3859,Great location but the rooms and surrounding areas are a bit worn down.  The lobby is clean and looks good once you step in the door but the area surrounding the hotel should also be taken care of... Buffet breakfast is nice with quite a large selection.,3

Very clean and staff were fantastic.No iron in room but they brought one up.There is s bar downstairs and the Batman was great not easy looking after Aussies and kiwis😜 There is a roof top pool but we were not allowed to use it due to a light breeze- rather disappointing.,3
3861,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel in early September. The hotel is located on a very busy street with a bus stop a few feet away from all rooms. The noise from the traffic very late at night and from the buses was extremely loud and we could not get a single night of sleep.   In addition, the parking at this motel is very limited and is on FIRST COME FIRST SERVE basis. There are only about 16 spaces and many more rooms on this property.  On several days, the number of cars were more than the parking slots and management allowed guests to park such that other cars were blocked! Even allowed some to park in the handicapped area.  We were departing on a very early flight and I went to request the hotel to ensure that our car was not blocked. She was extremely rude and said ""Our…",1

From the Railway station Friedrichstraße you reach it via U6 (Stadtmitte). Formerly, on similar occasions, I was many times in an other hotel on the nearby Leipziger Straße, but its breakfast prizes (>31€) being far from justified, I chose this hotel (breakfast 20€, same quality.) I was not disappointed.   The hotel has an interesting, quite varied floor plan and, as a consequence, many of its 139 rooms are quite individual. All are well and very tastefully furnished (and all seem to have a wall decoration showing a French army music corps with drums and trumpets). There will be a desk with the usual equipment, more than one seat, and a sufficient…",4

The staff was friendly and had a (not exciting) coffee kit to offer for free. we didn't have breakfast in the hotel, but booked the ""comfort"" room, which offered no difference what so ever than a normal hotel room you'd expect (which was maybe a bit disapointing). The location is great if you like Friedrichshain - a young, cool, living neighborhood with great nightlife. a place to put your head in the night if you're looking for a nice clean bed.",4

We booked the hotel a couple of months ago and were so excited because the pictures on the hotel website were amazing and the description sounded so luxurious.    The hotel had just opened to our surprise. We were told via email that it already opened back in July which was not true. It opened mid August.  Unfortunately the rooms were smaller than expected, we had less privacy than expected, and a lot of things were not ready yet.

Stood in line for 5 minutes for the concierge, but he was too busy talking to his buddy, I walked away and used the worldwide web for reservations  I did reach Lyle (some kind of manager) who asked me what I wanted for my inconvenience.  BTW, DON'T ASK THAT.  Either do something for me, or don't.  Lyle promised me points which never happened.  Thanks Lyle....

3869,This was our honeymoon. A five night stay. A good location close to public transport and attractions. The hotel is a stinker !! Literally it smells. Our room was tiny. The bathroom was roomy though. There were black hairs over the bathroom floor and toiletries minimal. The room was smelly and the bed linen was poor and short sheeted. Then to our disgust we started breaking out in red lumps and whelts over our back and arms. Bed bugs the obvious thought. We are now home and suffering. We have emailed the hotel but no response. Hotel staff are droll and breakfast is a joke unless you eat cake. Think twice before staying here.,1
3870,"Bed was an old worn out spring mattress that was overly soft. After the first night, I woke up with bad back pain from the unsupportive mattress. I asked to change rooms and was told that all rooms had the same old spring mattresses but they could put a board under the mattress to firm it up. The board did help but only slightly. I travel a lot and the cheap mattress would be unacceptable at even the cheapest motel.  The fact that they had custom cut boards to put under the mattresses tells you that they get the complaint very often.   Room was old and musty, but okay for an old SFO hotel.  ""Green Program"" is a scam.  You op-in to not receive any maid services in exchange for a $15 bar voucher per day.  Great right! Unfortunately the bar will only accept the voucher the same day…",1
3871,"Highly rated and over priced. The room was a typical hotel room but $450 a night. One would think at least the rooms would have decent coffee, but sadly, no. Ten o’clock at night all we could hear were a bunch of drunken bros and their ladies shouting four letter words at the top of their lungs, even with all windows closed. Clearly a disappointment. If you are going to spend the money, spend it elsewhere.",2

We booked here simply because it was within easy walking distance of the Arena, between there and the city centre, it turned out to be an ideal location.  It is midway between 2 metro stations, Bastille and Quai de la Rapee, and just a 5 minute walk from the bank of the River Seine, as tourists this was ideal for both the L'Opentour bus and the batobus on the river for getting to the main sights.

They did not seem to replenish these though on our second day at the Hotel, but I am sure if you needed anything, Housekeeping would oblige.  Maybe they just forgot to replenish our rooms?

I'm not kidding, watch where you walk, puddles in the gutters are actually yellow! Also, you have to pay for overnight parking as there is no parking for the hotel. We were told parking runs around $35 a night. Only  2 spaces on the street in front of the 'hotel' that are marked as reserved for the hotel.

After dinner we returned to the bar for a night cap, when I wanted to pay I couldn't because my deposit was not big enough. So I had to go to my room and then to the lobby to increase my deposit.

This totally was not the scenario, my first interaction with their chosen Hilton Diamond representative was with a Jolanta (from Poland or Ukraine). This woman was the epitome of horrible service: she insisted I pay $50 a night for incidentals and I was booked for 25+ nights (my other coworkers did not have this experience), she was rude, and refused to get a supervisor and stated she was the manager.

The hotel lobby turns into a club in the evening, which is fair for a W hotel, the problem is to check in, you now have to go through or pass by that club.

We didn't like the down blankets and pillows in bed - after telling about this to reception, they were changed promptly. Great value for money. Complimentary BVG tickets were a nice extra. ",4

The front desk rebuked me for complaining as if I was the one that made the sheets dirty and now asking for clean ones.  Anyway, slept on that (tried best)... Don't ruin your San Francisco experience by staying here.",1
3913,"I arranged for a parcel to be delivered to the hotel, I then called up the concierge to let them know to expect it and was promptly told that I’d be charged USD 5 for a document/letter and USD 10 for a small parcel. They mentioned it is for “handling fee” purposes since they have limited storage. To which I replied what if I were already staying at the hotel, they could just bring it straight up. Was given some baloney that they have to handle the goods with care and all that nonsense. I’ve never come across a hotel that charges to receive documents and parcels for a guest. Ever. The Titanium status seems to matter little to them.  So much for the legendary St Regis butler and concierge services.

Hopefully, the guests at Hotel Avenida Palace a hundred years ago weren't treated as cooly as we were.  We will never understand why some hotels feel the need to ""put on airs"", treating guests as though they were doing you a favor by letting you stay there.  All of the reception staff was cold, unhelpful and disinterested.  We dealt with several of the concierge staff, most of whom had the same attitude (the one exception was a wonderful gentleman named Joao who went out of his way to help us on several occasions).  The staff in the breakfast room was indifferent, just pointing us to a table and then ignoring us for the rest of our time there. The hotel itself is…",3

Room was slightly on the small side but soon got used to it and everything was quite practical. Clean, modern. Very good shower with different settings. Air cooling system wasn't brilliant and may be a problem in really hot weather. No noise issues in our room to the rear of the building. Decent choices and quality at breakfast, though nothing warm.

The hotel room was nice, except that they have my Wife and I two separate beds. My only complaint about the hotel was that the maid's didn't do a thorough job cleaning the room. The first night we checked I found a huge turd left in the toilet and the second day they didn't collect all of our trash even though we left it by the trash can. Also I had to call for extra towels (they only had one in the room). Overall I would recommend staying here. ",4

Problems such as sleepless nights due to construction in the building for almost the entire 6 months that I was there, very frequent and long power cuts due to electrical problems within the building (the surrounding area was not affected), a lack of compliance and proper training of the 'receptionists' who work at the building who can't give you a new key to your room if you lose it (meaning that you have to either ask to sleep with a friend, sleep in the corridor or sleep somewhere else), rain water leaking into your room, lack of noise cancellation between the rooms meaning you can hear what everyone is doing above,…",2

The hotel was crowded with a wedding party, which was fine but when we asked at check in for a high floor, they gave us the 2nd floor, best they had (and I'm a Marriott Rewards member)...when we arrived in the room it was dark...the lighting was low...it was depressing. We took a quick nap before we starting getting ready for my husband's birthday dinner at Ruth Chris.

3920,"If you need a base to explore Berlin then this is a good solid choice. The rooms are a decent size and well equipped, very close to the station and the location is good for exploring on foot. The staff are also friendly and helpful in sorting out minor problems. there is also a pool which the kids loved and a midday checkout time is very civilised  Down sides are that the hotel is a bit corporate in character and breakfast is very expensive (but there a some very good local alternatives). I also found the beds gave me a sore back after a couple of nights.",4
3921,"Overall, this older hotel is not well-kept. Floors are not vacuumed and walls are thin. Only thing going for them is the location and some of the front desk - helpful when I needed assistance (concierge) with phone issues. However, there was a gentleman who put me in a dirty room (at check-in) and made me upgrade for a ""nicer amenity"" and when i came back to tell him, he ignored me. If they didn't have the location aspect, i don't think this hotel would be in service.",2

We paid alot of money for a double room and ended up getting a twin, the room is completely green, everything is green! Its weird and ugly and ensuite is a bit smelly. Good shower though. Location is fantastic",3

Clean, modern with a very friendly staff (especially the registration desk is great, they look you in the eyes and treat you as a person also in a busy season as Christmas). Also little details, as getting a chocolat ‘Nikolaus’ on Dez 5th at breakfast are very much appreciated by guests. I rated it 4 out of 5, because the (excellent) breakfast is too expensive (over 20 euro per person). ",4
3925,A pleasant hotel in a good location for the Lisbon Challenge Half Distance. It has a noisy road on one side and a railway on the other but as a city hotel it is ok. The rooms are clean and spacious although could do with a bit of a refurb. We chose to pay extra for a river view which was ok and it was a good choice as it meant you were high up and therefore the noise from the road at night wasn't too much of a problem. Overall an alright hotel for this event. Join the loyalty programme when booking and wifi is then free and the wifi is good and fast. Breakfast is ok but nothing special.,3
3926,"Very good hotel, very clean and comfortable. Spa very small, but still lovely to use. Staff at reception were very pleasant and helpful. Position was great for us near rail station. We only ate breakfast at the hotel which could have had a bit more of variation and really surprised there were no bananas a staple breakfast food!! Overall a very good hotel and no hesitation in recommending it.",4
3927,"Clean and tidy hotel on the outskirts of the city and therefore probably not the best hotel if you are car-less or don't like public transport.   Bedrooms are nice and the hotel uses art in a nice way to decorate what is essentially a boring looking building near industrial units. I wasn't actually that impressed with the art, but conceptually, it worked.  Reception staff were nice, efficient and friendly. Bar and restaurant staff were a little slow and needed regular reminders for menus, drinks and bills.   The 22 bus is a quick way to get to the city centre and an uber costs approx €9 compared to €15 or so for a taxi. If you are happy to cycle, it's no more than 15 minutes to town.

Excuse was that Housekeeping didn't arrive until then. I really don't believe that manager on duty doesn't have keys. I had to leave for the airport at 6:30am. So too bad for me and my business. Won't return to this hotel. I recommend staying at Fairmont San Francisco next door where they offer outstanding 24hr guest service.,1

I had one person in front at check in and it took the better part of 20 minutes.    When actually was served not greated, and had to ask about things such as club lounge access, breakfast etc. Only when reminded that a spire member did they produce the sheet with all the standard perks.

Metro station also in the square which is convenient, or you can just walk easily down into city centre. They were happy to accept our luggage until booking in time, as our flight was an early one.  Hotel is smartly decorated but in dark tones, which is not helped by dim lighting and makes it feel a bit cave-like in the corridors. Room also decorated in dull colours.

Shopping is good along this route or Kleiststrasse.  Don't miss Kaufhaus de Westens (KaDeWe) food hall.

The pool area isn't big and unfortunately it was littered with empty glasses from the night before.  It can be a nice place to relax but is dependent on other guests and the gardener who loved nothing more than to clip/chainsaw the hedges throughout the day.

It's also close to the S-bahn station, it's good for people who need to go to the Messe for trade shows; it's only 3 stops from the hotel.

I must say that it was better than expected though, they did a good job isolating the windows. -Wifi was not good in my room (5th floor), it was too slow to work with.

There are no real pool attendants, watching for when people leave in order to clear the seats. So all the chaircovers remain on the loungers, until you decide to remove them. Good luck finding some shade as well. So the guests now do the work🤷🏽‍♂️. Good luck finding the towel people as well, I only found towels because I saw kids taking them out of a storage area.

The rooms are small (not unusual for overseas) but nice and clean. I loved my room! It was a courtyard facing room. The only noise I heard was kids in the hall and next door.  The breakfast hours were long, therefore really convenient. The selection was pretty good for a smaller hotel.  Since it was a birthday trip, I splurged for the roses in my room.

It is located in a more local area where you won't find an overwhelming amount of tourists. It's a very short walk to the metro and local cafes, restaurants, and a few tourist spots (Sacre Coeur, Montemarte, Moulin Rouge).  The front desk was able to get us our room early (as our flight arrived earlier than check-in) and they were incredibly helpful in providing directions or suggestions.

Breakfast was more than enough and it was delicious. The metro station was really close to hostel. The most important thing for us were the air conditioning in the room. I think each room has it. The only negative thing (actually it did not bother us but some one could say) room was not very big. But we stay 3 people in one room. All the other thing was really good,5

Sun garden was great particularly as we had great weather and were able to take advantage of it for an evening drink. Room was very spacious for three people.

Be aware that face cloths and tea and coffee are not replenished each day so you need to reorder from housekeeping.  The breakfast was OK, not a large selection  but something for most people.  Staff were very helpful and friendly. The decor of the corridors and rooms need a bit of getting used to. Walls, ceilings and furniture are all black with a hint of green and grey and therefore very dark. I'm not sure what the designer was trying to achieve but I  wasn't a fan of it. If you like bright and airy accommodation then this is not the hotel for you.",3
3969,"My husband and I like to have a weekend away once a year in Paris - and for the 3rd year in a row we are staying in this lovely boutique hotel.  Perfectly situated (and quick direct metro ride from Gare du Nord), right by St Sulpice church and in a lovely district.  Quiet, comfortable rooms, lovely atmosphere in the hotel and very helpful and friendly staff.  Also love the fact they do complimentary afternoon tea in their cosy lounge!  Highly recommend!!!  ",5
3970,"We stayed here in February on a trip with university. The hostel was tidy and kept clean, the staff were very friendly and helpful. the breakfast was very basic, (cereal, bread, fruit, coffee and tea.) the hostel is about a half an hour walk away from the main streets. There is a lot of cheap transport available about a 2 minute walk away from the hostel.  the hostel policy states that there should be no noise after 10pm but for all 3 nights that we stayed there was lots of noise from other people staying in rooms close to us, we noticed the reception and nothing was done to stop the noise.  all of the staff that I spoke to were fluent in English.  Overall the stay was good but I think that the rooms could be cleaner and the bar could offer a wider selection of drinks.",3

Bear gave me an w excellent massage and my facial wasn't bad either. However, you pay a premium at a spa like this at a resort for the extras...saunas, pool, etc. You typically just want to hang out all day and soak up the pampering. Not here. It was a concrete jungle. The pool was a lap pool with no seating but you wouldn't want to because it was surrounded by 4 walls of concrete. The relaxation lounge was in that same concrete jungle with some lemon water and hot tea but the seating was very uncomfortable..not a place to relax. Basically had my services wondered around a bit and started feeling like the…",2

On arriving, we were picked up by our transfer on the assumption that it would be a quick journey. However, almost an hour later we arrived at the hotel.  We checked in & went straight up to our room. This was not what we booked, 2 single beds pushed together does not make it a double. To be fair, at this point the reception staff moved us to a different room with an actual double (at the expense of the poor people who's room it actually was, as they hadn't yet arrived). The hotel itself was very nice, a large room with a modern decor & good views. However that's where it ended. The food was awful, the service was shocking & the staff were somewhat lacking…",3

The bar was open but you could get only alcohol which is cool but if you don't really in the mood for alcohol you don't have any other option.. also there is nothing in the room like a minibar or a kettle because they don't want you to have a ""picnic"" in the room (according to their brochure). I think they should find a way to offer another option for their guests.

The teeniest elevator brought us upstairs to our room.  Front desk person is always friendly and helpful.  Our favorite was the machines in the lobby for free coffee/cappaccino/etc. and another with many wine selections.  So convenient and nice to sit and wait for our travel companions.,5

The staff was super accommodating and helpful. We needed a restaurant recommendation and Louie made reservations for us at an amazing little place down the street. Onto our room which we honestly had a difficult time leaving. We stayed in a junior suite (very affordable) that was decked out with character. Whether it was a stocked bookshelf, light up tiles in the shower, or furniture that looked like it belonged at Versailles, we couldn't help but feel like we were in our dream room. On top of all that, the location was about as convenient as possible for anything you'd want to do. Oh and free breakfast. Do…",5

The housekeeping staff didn't speak english so it was impossible to request anything.  The coffee pot was missing parts so it couldn't be used.  When we got there we questioned its cleanliness since we saw rubber gloves on the floor in the bathroom.  They didn't clean the room well leaving dirty kleenex tissures on the furniture.  The front staff was average but they sure didn't rush to help you.  We asked ahead of time for a large vehicle to take us to our event knowing that  it would be difficult to get at the last minute.  We were assured that it would be there to get us to the wedding.…,1

However, it was lacking for nothing and was generally clean, if a little dusty.

Pros : proximity to museums, clean, quiet, lovely terrace with lots of sunlight, cost.  Cons : single unfriendly, unhelpful staff member (the remainder were happy to go out of their way to help), size. ",3

The lobby is not real inviting and certainly not relaxing. After my travels I want to enter into a hotels that I feel relaxed in and can unwind. This hotel does not offer that experience at checking.  Our room was an ocean front with two small ""queens"" more like full size beds and a couch with a coffee table and dresser.

However, it gave me the impression that it is being operated on a shoe-string budget.  I would rate it as a 3 star rather than the 4 star rating shown in the brochure.  The quality and variety of food left an awful lot to be desired.  Very limited selection and certainly no imagination used in variety of food presented over the week.  If you are happy to survive on Mcdonald style chips, boiled rice and a bit of salad then you should be alright, otherwise look for another hotel.  A number of people we met here were of the same opinions as ourselves.  Negatives aside, Madeira is a place we would certainly  visit again…",3
3985,Had a nice stay. Compared to the rest of Europe you don't get much accomodation for your money in Amsterdam. For example for the same money as La Boheme we stayed in 4.5 stars in Berlin And 5 stars in Prague. That Is not the hotels fault tho. The good points about this hotel are. The location is fantastic. Right near a tram so you can get around the entire city easy without walking. Plenty of food coffeshops and cafes around. The breaky is good. It was relatively quite at night. The bed was comfy. The staff are super friendly and helpful. The rooms are on the small side. There is no air con just a fan. The stairs are a nightmare with heavy luggage. If you are old or frail this ones not for you. WIFI was good. ,3

Call me old fashion but when I travel, I like to empty my suitcase, and yet this is impossible in Volkshotel, since my room did not have a single drawer or cupboard, just some hooks to hang your coat. Floor was pure concrete, so remember to bring some sleepers. Breakfast on the top floor was OK, and the vintage look very very pretty. The terrace by the bar to have a drink in the evening was pleasant, but nothing too special. Overall, an amusing experience, and certainly different to anywhere I had been before. Glad I was only staying for one night though.",3

We were on floor 6 and was quiet. Please note My location didn't matter so I'm not sure how convenient it is. It was about a 20 min drive to Tegan airport. Very nice!",4

It wasn't until morning that I noticed how dirty my room was, especially the bathroom. I mentioned the condition at checkout and shared these images with the front desk person. Vicki was great - a bit horrified - but assured me that this was not the norm at the W Lakeshore and offered me some bonus SPG points. That was three weeks ago.

3993,"Having read a few of the recent reviews and having stayed over a weekend, my problem was not with any bar across the road. Rather it was with the 3 tram lines which pass the hotel front very closely from 0600 till 2400. They even throw in a few appearances during the night too. So if you are allocated a room at the front of the hotel bring along your ear plugs.  The building appears to have double glazing, but perhaps it is in need of renewal or even triple glazing as is now offered. Perhaps there may also  be a grant from the City, who run the trams.  There are ways of keeping down tram noise, which were used in the new Hautbahnhof tunnels, but sadly it seems not here.  Otherwise the Breakfast was good.

Once we returned home we unfortunately realized we had brought home bed bugs. After weeks of ridding our home of the pests which was not only stressful and expensive but also made us feel dirty I contacted the hotel to simply inform them of the issue. The first initial call I made I was told the housekeeping manager would be in touch. No apology. No nothing. Next day received an email from the assistant manager. Still no apology but insisted we could not have gotten them from their hotel. The assistant manager then told me I could contact their pest control company. After a few emails exchanged and my…,1

Boring food, juices straight from the carton (and you get an award if you could guess that you were drinking grapefruit juice), warm water for tea (its in a flask!!!) etc etc etc. Oh, and its on the mezzanine floor (floor 1) so use lift number 3 because it is the only lift that goes down to level 1 else you will go to the reception level and walk up stairs or take yet another lift. And even THEN you cant find the room! 2. Wine bar is comical. Well, read above. You see its the breakfast room and its prepared for the following morning's breakfast.

As for the hotel, my room did not have closets ... just some hangers on the wall.  There is no heating or AC ... the room smelled must and humid and the whole place is unkempt. Oh and the elevator requires that you manually open the door and then some other contraption just to get in.

Because there were dozens of youth football teams, you can (or not) imagine what an ants nest this was. The room was clean, better than expected to be honest. You can however notice ‘marks’ from previous visitors with little respect, which is unfortunately the audience this kind of hotels seems to attract. This place really served our purpose, and for that I would give score 4.   However, we paid for half board... breakfast was meager, but we don’t ask much.

The room and restaurant staff were amazing and very polite...however, I have taken a point off for the following reasons - there were times when the barman was grumpy and occasions down right rude to my friends, for no good reason. Service at the bar was very slow.   I also needed an iron and there wasn't one in the room.

They basically said ""too bad, so sad.""  Night time wait staff was much friendlier and accommodating.",3
4009,The general impression I formed of this hotel was that it was relying on it's reputation as one of Madeira's up market hotels and is clearly overpriced. The breakfast was poor to say the least and on one occasion there were no fried eggs without an explanation! The bacon and sausage were of a poor quality and the scrambled eggs appeared to powdered. Quite honestly I had a better breakfast in Leeds airport before leaving. That aside the only thing in it's favour is it's location next to the sea. This place needs to sort out it's kitchen fast and the rooms need a refurb. There are other better located hotels in Lido which are more modern and cheaper. I wouldn't recommend it.,3

CONS: The room was very disappointing. The hot water was not at all consistent, and took many very uncomfortable showers. The sheets and towels were not a great quality, and they did not offer to change your towels in stays of less than 3 days.  The room was also quite loud.

Also, from 14-21, you can visit 7th floor for cakes, coffee and tea.  I also enjoyed a large selection of teas available.  The location is also wonderful with S-Bahn and U-Bahn stations close by.  There is even a pharmacy just around the corner.  Overall, I strongly recommend this hotel to whoever visiting Berlin for business or pleasure.",4
4027,"The hotel infrastructure was nice, in line with what you'll see in other good hotels in Rio. The included mini bar is also a treat for the children. Nonetheless, we had a number of issues during a simple 3-day weekend. From more serious things like finding more than 10 pieces of broken glass around the pool (clearly from the parties they had around the pool every night) and having to wait hours (after countless requests) for a crib for our son, to minor things like not being able to get food service at the pool area before noon and not having enough towels in the room for the number of guests we reserved for. We had a list of over 10 problems we had in a 3-day stay. All in all, you definitely don't get the five star experience for the five star price you're paying.",2

In over 10 years as a Platinum SPG guest I have never had a worse experience than my one miserable night at The Westin River North.  If you are SPG loyalist, stay at The Gwen in Chicago - a far superior hotel where the staff are actually nice and professional.  Prior to my arrival I called the hotel direct to ask about a certain type of suite I wanted if I was to use a Suite Night upgrade for my stay.  I was assured the room type was available.  At check in I again asked and was again told it was the type of room I wanted.  When I opened the door to my room it was exactly what I said I didn't want.  I seriously didn't care either way, I was fine in a normal…",1

4039,"We stayed in a suite on the 10th floor. The room was beautiful with huge bathroom and dressing area. I loved the room. However, the hotel is located far from city center (about 30+ min walk) and there is really nothing around the hotel except a mall which we did not visit. What really surprised me is that this hotel is supposedly a 5 star and yet the service was very hit or miss. The reception area doubles as a concierge and when we tried to get restaurant recommendations they were not very helpful. A guy who said he was in charge of guest relations was near by and basically told us that he could not help us. For that price, I am sure you could find a hotel which has better location and service.",3

New hotel so super clean. ,5

Terrible for having to visit the facilities in the middle of the night.  We were offered an alternate style and should have taken it. Too many switches for electronics and lights in bedroom would go off on their own.  Our traveling friends experienced the same in their room. TVs worked intermittently which the maid blamed on the weather(??). Comfortable beds.  Terrible service in the restaurant.",3
4043,"Had a couple bottles of Champaign.  Went to pay the bill and the waitress said ""your card is not working"".  Which is strange because my AMEX has no limit. So I gave a different credit card.  Signed my tab at the end of the night for around 1400.  The next day, I noticed an 1881 charge...then two 394 dollar charges.  So I checked my other card (the one the waitress said wasn't working) and she ran about 2400 through on that card.  So for a 1400 dollar tab, they ran a little under 5,000 dollars total  So I tried calling the club and left voicemails and nobody responded.  I called their bookkeeping office and left messages...no response.  So I started calling the GM Juan Leyva of the hotel, for three weeks.  No response.  They left me no other option but to dispute the charges.   …",1
4044,"A great stay at the Pullman. We stayed in a junior suite which was very large and clean.  The bed was super comfortable. It did seem more about the size of the room though as I felt it lacked the plush feel of a suite. We only ate breakfast at the hotel which was great, a varied choice of breakfast (sausages, eggs, bacon, cheeses, breads, toast, cereals etc). I had an omelette made up most days - highly recommend. The bar area was really nice with an amazing drink selection. The pool area was closed at the time of our visit but we still had the opportunity to use the intercontinental spa and pool over the road (which is lovely but be prepared for a chilly pool temperature when you first get in!). The staff were very friendly and worked hard. All in all a great stay. ",4

Located within a few minutes of the Metro and Avenue Paulista this hotel makes a decent base in which to explore Sao Paulo from. The area is relatively safe.  Customer service towards members of Radisson Rewards was non existent and disgraceful. Non of the benefits ""elite members"" are entitled to were offered, no room upgrade, no in room benefit, absolutely nothing! No point in having a reward scheme if properties can just disregard it on a whim. To make matters worse the hotel did not even credit the points I was entitled to after a 4 night stay!

4047,"Rio has gotten incredibly expensive and this hotel is a perfect example.  It is a mediocre hotel (I say mediocre because the renovation looks/feels cheap), the service is very poor, the elevators take a lifetime, the gym is absolutely ridiculous.  All this and a tiny hotel room cost us R$1000 + tax (u$500/night + 15% tax) AND it was almost sold out.   I could not help but feel like the owners of the hotel were just completely gouging their guests.   For instance, how can you sell u$500 / night rooms and have gym equipment that is at least 10 years old?  There were 5 cardio machines and literally ONE worked.  That is absurd.   Management, if you read this, do yourselves a favor and BEG the owners for new equipment.  It will cut down on people like me feeling totally ripped off.…",2

The Catedral square also has live musicians in the square outside the horel, which is especially nice to enjoy in the evenings. That said, our room was quiet and we didn't hear any outside noise. The front desk service was friendly and the room was comfortable. The rooms also have a full size bathroom, which I've found to be a luxury often when traveling Europe. The only con is the bed; it wasn't comfortable, and although I could likely fall asleep on a bed of rocks, my husband suffered a sore back during our stay.",4

But, what really was unacceptable for me was the way my fellow colleagues visiting from Europe were treated in the restaurant when they were trying to get breakfast. They were accused of lying with regard to the number of vouchers they gave for breakfast. The restaurant manager even went so far to challenge them by saying they could check the surveillance video in her office. How embarrassing for us as hosts for our international guests to experience this. Two words on this hotel in light of many other choices in the downtown Chicago area: stay away. ",1

The hotel is in a perfect location near the metro, walking distance to many restaurants and cafes but still situated on a quiet street. The staff was friendly and professional.

Beds really are a personal thing though, so I can't say that everyone will have the same experience. But for me, I found it difficult to sleep and my back and shoulders were very sore. After 3 nights, I was really happy to get back home to my own bed.   The heating was an issue too. I found it hard to cool the room as there are only heaters, and heat travels upwards. We were in Berlin in November, but had to open the windows at night to try to get a pleasant temperature. (We switched the heater off for the duration of our stay)   Even with these issues, I was pretty pleased with the hotel overall.   The reception staff were lovely…",4

When we finally found our rooms fumbling through the many long corridors, there were no bath towels in the rooms and the lighting was very dim. Our rooms faced the swimming pool and it was very noisy as it was the Vietnamese school holiday and the pool was filled with screaming kids.  At the breakfast restaurant, we were told to find an empty table. Since it was crowded, we ended up having to 'stake out' a seat, definitely not a 5star hotel experience. Not all staff spoke English and we had to get our own utensils as they were too busy to set the table.   We chose to stay there as it was the 'Best ' hotel in Vung Tau.…",2

When I approached the manager by the counter she mentioned that we are free to change hotels and she wished me luck finding availability in town, can you believe that answer? I sent an email to corporate and no reply. is this the type of Service that Westin offers to its customers. I hope that people read this. I am never coming back",1
4061,I travel for business a lot. I was here for 12 Days and got to know a little about this property. I was in an executive suite. It was clean. I was on the 23rd floor and above me was the executive lounge. The floor up there is wood and they start working about 6:00am with heels on. It’s very loud and will wake you from a deep sleep! The air conditioning hardly works so you will be hot and calling them daily about it. My room had two bathrooms - each sink hardly would drain. I’ll stop there - it was a 50-50 experience. Good luck with yours!,3

The room overlooked the courtyard area and was quiet, clean and comfortable--especially the bed!

The ""retreat"" is actually located in a rough part of town with bars on everyone's windows, abandoned burnt-down buildings, and gated front yards. I had to pay in advance by mail with a check. They almost never answered the phone. When I arrived, the manager told me she over-booked and I'd have to stay in a storage-type area just through a massive pile of junk that she called an office. It was freezing cold. The manager slept in the room next to me with no door on her room. There was no lock on my door. The smoke detector beeped the entire time I was there from a low battery that she didn't want to bother changing (even though I offered to help with the ladder). She also had a dog that shed all over the couches in the lounge. I never got a receipt for my visit because she couldn't find it.

It is, in every way, a decent place to stay if you are in Lisbon for a few days and don't expect to be in your room much.    If you are looking for a hotel to be a central part of your travel experience, this is not the place for you.  If you are looking for a place to put your stuff, sleep at night, and have breakfast, then this is place is perfect.

We can see how others might have a different experience, however.",3

The problem is that service at the restaurant is extremely slow, with waiting times of 20-30 minutes not uncommon. Breakfast is also an issue, with frequent queues in the only coffee machine they have. The staff is attentive at all times, but prices do not reflect the lack on investment in more staff or equipment to make the stay more confortable.

4089,I booked directly through their website about a week before check-in date and called the hotel after to confirm. The man on the phone found my reservation and sent me an email confirmation just in case. Fast forward to when I went to go check-in. Lo and behold they cancelled my reservation without letting me know!!! “Apparently” I had no credit card information and they couldn’t contact me beforehand because they had no email and phone number on file. Um what?! I showed them on my phone that there’s no way to submit a reservation on their website unless ALL those fields were filled out! Of course all rooms were sold out by now and they had to send me elsewhere. VERY disappointing as I was an hour late to my event due to our cancelled reservation and getting another hotel!,1
4090,"Everything said about the hotel in other reviews is spot on.  However, at the moment - 12.30 - fiesta is in full swing and we are enjoying it hugely (well there is no way you could sleep😃). But.  The mini bar contains coke and water. And despite the fact that the reception is staffed, apparently you can't get a drink beyond midnight on a Saturday (fiesta) night.  Not good enough.  Really, just not good enough. ",3
4091,"Having stayed at the Mandarin Oriental in Bangkok many years ago and remembering the hotel fondly, we decided to reduce our planned 4-day stay in Barcelona to 3 days but stay at the MO instead! Located in the Park Lane equivalent street in a former bank headquarters, the hotel exudes luxury at every turn, both from the facilities to the guests. The rooftop open air restaurant set the scene on our first evening, with a delicious small plates meal featuring Peruvian cuisine. Exquisite tastes, with excellent service, but at120 Euros, not something to be enjoyed every evening.  Being a city centre hotel, the room was small, with a definite triumph of design over function, but luxurious nevertheless. The service throughout the hotel was impeccable, especially from the Concierges who…",4
4092,Location I'd perfect! Smack in the middle of Gothic Quarter. Walk to everything from here. Hotel staff is extremely nice and very helpful. Rooms are super clean with very attentive house keeping. What ever was requested was supplied very fast. Breakfast was served daily and was worth the extra money. Hotel decor was Beautiful....top notch.  Only issue is the rooms are very small. Overs only 2 twin size beds if need of 2 beds.  Our room had no natural light or window to outside. Very small gym area. 2 pieces of equipment. But Gym Holmes Place is. 5 miles away. 10 min nice walk.  If you don't mind those 2 small issues then you can't go wrong here. Room service 24 hrs also nice to have.  5 star 🌟 hotel 👍 ,4
4093,"The website painted images of luxury and comfort, but that’s not quite what we got.   The hotel shares its space with two other hotels, and residential flats. The whole building isn’t the Grand Hotel.  The normal rooms are all ground floor, and are very modern and generally clean, although mine had an odd smell which dissipated eventually. The hotel offered a new from the next day if needed, but it wasn’t required. However the climate control was very difficult to get the temperature regulated correctly.  What got me the most is the hotel sells itself as 4 star, but doesn’t offer the amenities I’d expect for that rating. It consists of rooms, a front desk and a breakfast room. There is no restaurant, no cafe or bar. However across the road is the excellent Cafe Bosco which…",3
4094,"A nice hostel, close to the city center, just 15 minutes walking to Placa Catalunya, where La Rambla starts. Barcelona is a party city, but if you want a quieter place to stay, this is the place and I was looking for such a place. ",4

4097,"Could not have been happier with this hotel. Easy to find from UBahn station, literally around the corner from Checkpoint Charlie. Room was spacious clean and warm. Staff were so friendly (and multilingual from what we observed the receptionist helping some tourists with maps etc) lovely bar/cafe area with happy hour cocktails but some cafes nearby also. Late check out was no problem. Highly recommend this hotel and look forward to returning in the future. ",5
4098,"Ratty saggy furniture in the lobby. Frayed towels. No fans in the bathroom. No “Do Not Disturb” and this housekeeping disturb multiple times beginning early in the morning, even on weekends. (I know they have a job to do, but ...) Keurig pods and clean mugs not refreshed any day of our stay. Called once for replenishment, waited 90 minutes, didn’t bother again. Wow. Shabby. Very. At this price point - at any price point - this is poor service. Go elsewhere.",1
4099,"The hospitality at the hotel was very poor, we stayed here twice within the span of two weeks, for 6 nights in total.   The bellman never greeted us, never helped us with our bags, English was poorly spoken by the reception staff. Even the staff in the restaurant were literally clearing our breakfast plates while we were still eating so that they could finish their shift.   The points that we were supposed to receive for the green choice were never awarded. The worst issue was that we were erroneously billed for over $600 USD and when brought up this issue it was supposed to be resolved upon on our 2nd stay, but when we arrived to check in again it was evident no one had looked at the issue and is still on my credit card and has not been resolved now being charged interest.  The…",2
4100,I was there 2 years ago and still talk about how horrible and utterly creepy this place was. Unfortunately I was stuck there for business. This place was upgraded by Hilton?  I can only imagine how gruesome it must have been before. Tiny shabby room with a disgusting bathroom. I had a memorably miserable stay. It’s taken this long- 2 years- to get over it. Maybe I’m not over it yet.,1

4103,Rooms in the HF Ipanema Porto are OK but outside the summer season they switch the airconditioning to central controls ... In March you can still have a warm day in Porto with as result a room that is too warm to sleep in. Opening the windows doesn't really work due to the noise from the busy road and because of the small opening there's hardly any fresh air coming in anyway. Not pleasant.   Also the housekeeping staff managed to walk into my room 3 times (!!) without knocking on the door or waiting for a reply. I understand there's time pressure to get the place cleaned up but this is just not right.   I have to say the hotel offered a solution to the heat in the room but that meant re-packing all my stuff again and moving to another hotel.   As mentioned above the room itself…,3
4104,"Let me start by saying that I travel a lot and there is a reason why when I select my hotels, I look for the 5 stars chains that “should” ensure the same standards independently where you are in the world. I’ve been in many countries, both developed and underdeveloped.   The experience of this hotel goes beyond what I have ever experienced in my life. Many people before me have rated this place well above his standards.   The view is amazing. No doubt about it, but everything from breakfast to service is below any standard.   I had to point out 3 times that a plate with half eaten pizza was still standing on the corridor floor for at least 24 hours. I was assured that this was not acceptable by the first two gentlemen that took the call at the service desk and nothing was done. …",2

4107,"The rooms are ok. Clean and ok. but the service is a nightmare and how it is handled too. - When I returned to my room, there was dirty towel on the desk and a wine cooler with ice - 30 min before I wanted to check out they start cleaning my room and took al stuff in the bathroom with them - when complaining no one cares - Management is not available - all managers have been on a business trip  - in the executive lounge they charge 45 RMB for a tea  Complains are either not followed up or just ""sorry"".  There are many other hotels. Go there.!",2
4108,While staying at this hotel I was locked out of my room on the first night and the 2nd night I was escorted out of the hotel at 11pm because “my payment didn’t go through”. When I called my bank they confirmed that the payment was approved. This was the most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to me. I still haven’t received an apology or anything.,1
4109,We booked this place since it was nearby the airport and we had to leave for the same very early.The closeness to the airport and also train station is the only argument to book this hotel.A highlight of our stay was that we asked for a fork to be sent to our room and were told that this would be charged with 5 Euros. Seriously?!?,3
4110,"We stayed for the weekend, checked in on Friday and left on Monday. The good things: The staff were friendly and helpful.  Breakfast for € 8.50 was good enough. (We found out about the restaurant in the basement later.)  They have a pool table you can use, not free of charge of course.  Roof bar. Vending machine with drinks New towels every day. Close to the train metro. Is literally 2 minute walk.  Things could have been better: We couldn't find the table tennis Rental bikes. Don't expect the most comfortable ones but they will get you where you want to go. ",4
4111,"Right after the Cannes film festival, when all the prices dropped to normality, I checked into ""Colette"" and was nothing but pleasantly surprised. Although situated on a very busy street - exactly oposite of the Central Station, you don't get disturbed by noise because the windows/ doors don't let any unwanted sounds in. And when all gets quiet in the evening, you can sit on the balcony and contemplate. The rooms are spacey, well designed, and YAY to the bathtub! I also enjoyed the air-con temperature, which wasn't exaggeratedly cooled down, but was just perfect. The breakfast is good, not over the top - but the choice of fresh fruit is surprisingly good. But, what makes this place special is friendliness of its staff, so refreshing in France :-D",5
4112,"Despite 2 phone tracers, breakfast was not delivered to my room until 7:30 am while I requested it be delivered between 7:00 and 7:15 am.  I dare not go to toilet from 6:55 am to 7:30 am.  What an inconvenient experience, let alone a waste of time. The hotel is otherwise good.",2
4113,The room is boiling .there is no Aircon... And they never said when I checked in. It's stylish and nice BUT WE NEED AIRCON BECAUSE ITS BOILING . and it is outrageous to charge 350.usd  for a room with no Aircon. They brought a portable one that sounds like a lawnmower,1
4114,"The beds and carpets are so old and nasty. We wanted to have a get away in the City but honestly it was not worth the money. The hotel is very average, would rather pay more for a better service and cleanliness.",1
4115,This hotel is in a good location and offers basic accommodation but with some high levels of service. The receptionists I spoke were both extremely helpful and friendly. The breakfast at 10 Euros extra was good value. The room I had was small but clean and comfortable. However it a feel of more hostel than hotel. For people on a limited budget this is a great value place to stay. Although the weather was not good for my stay the garden is a bonus and gives this hotel a further selling point.,3
4116,"Granted we booked last minute, but our choice or the Porto Mare was based on the TripAdviser reviews indicating that all rooms faced the beautiful gardens, the sea or the many pools available. We weren’t offered a choice on the website but booked on this basis over other hotel choices. Unfortunately our balcony overlooks a rear service road; the room itself  is lovely. We asked at reception straight away if there was an alternative, but we’re told the hotel was fully booked and that we had reserved a ‘land’ view room (whatever that means) - It’s a shame really for what is otherwise a lovely hotel.   We visited the Goya Restaurant last night on spec. Highly recommended if you like old fashioned dining and a very reasonably price too. We will return here at least over the next…",3

4118,"I previously lived in Shanghai and chose this hotel, as I used to live in the neighborhood and had a gym membership card for this hotel. Their gym and pool is really fantastic, but that is about it. The hotel is quite old and I had a room facing the busy street. Every morning I was woken up at 6 by the traffic, noise insulation non existent. The bathroom had a scale which was full of rust and didn't function. Also the bath tub was probably made in the 80ies - it is tiny. I maybe could give my 3 year old son a bath in there. One of the biggest problems for me as a business traveller was the not functioning internet access. I was not able to downlaod emails with the the complementary internet service, so I bought a 60 CNY package, and it still didn't work afterwards!",2

Thank you for taking onboard my requests and making our stay that little bit more special. 10/10 ",5
4121,"Tried to check in at 1pm on Sunday and was told it would cost an additional 20 euros for early check in despite the rooms being ready, all the more galling as I stay here at least once or twice a year often bringing groups. Breakfast was very poor, despite not being particularly busy I had to go and find someone to bring coffee to the table. The girl behind the egg station clearly did not want to be there or interact with customers, not once did she ever come near to smiling. The “hot” food was anything but hot. All in all a very poor experience and certainly not worth the cost, look elsewhere, there are plenty other hotels who will value your custom. Management have obviously imposed cost cutting measures and prevented receptionists from using their discretion on check ins. I…",2
4122,"I'm wondering where all of the great reviews of this place come from?  This is massive resort that has seen better days.  The beach is not useable with constant onshore winds and large waves.  The closest useable beach is 1 mile away.  The rooms are in a sad state - the shower/tubs are from the 80's with a shower curtain - I have never seen a set up like this in a $600/night hotel.  The carpets are stained and frayed.  The breakfast buffet was Four Season priced but mediocre at best.  The absolute worst part is its a half mile walk anywhere from your room - to the restaurants, to the pool, to the parking lot.  This hotel might be okay for a meeting/convention but not for a vacation.",2

We were apparently upgraded to a superior room, at no cost.  The room was certainly not as good as the standard one we had last year which had a partial sea view.  This year we had a view over the terraces of several other rooms and one of the bars where a party was in full swing when we arrived.  The aircon in the room was pretty useless so the room was stuffy and hot.  The reception staff were not as efficient or friendly as last year.  The staff did not work well as a team and seemed reluctant to engage with clients.  On one occasion when a lady was trying to book places on the courtesy bus with one of the…",3

All staff were very friendly and helpful and we were able to leave our bags in the luggage room on the last day. There are plenty of supermarkets nearby and lots of gorgeous backstreet restaurants, we loved Anooshey's Indian that was literally over the road and a lovely little Italian we found in the handy ""restaurant recommendations"" book left in the hotel reception, that was just round the corner.

Would definitely advise to get the Welcome to Berlin travel card, makes travel a lot easier and cheaper. Money off vouchers in the book too. Only minor grumbles about hotel. We would've preferred plumper pillows however another one was provided when we asked. Just personal preference. Hairdryer didn't like going above setting one, it would cut out. Ok for me but might be frustrating for people with thicker hair. Nice choice of food at breakfast. Use of safety deposit box, free of charge.",4

Shabby, outdated, and overall not on level of what you would expect from most  Marriotts. Go somewhere else. ",1

The bad: Service, we had 3 different interactions with 3 different front desk agents, all left us very uninspired. No hello, welcome, how was your trip? No, thanks for staying with us, how was your stay? Just very cold and only interested in form of payment.   The room was pretty clean, but the extremely stained carpet made you wonder....  Breakfast ended at 11am on a Sunday...  And 1 big mistake (I am a former hotel manager), at check-in, we were given our keys without a key packet with the room number written right on the key!

Upon arrival, the front desk tells us that they do not have any king beds available, and that it is Ohana's policy not to guarantee specific bed sizes.  We were offered either a queen or two twins.  We took the queen, and weren't at all concerned, so what if we didn't get a king we thought.  Big mistake.   Apparently this hotel has both newly renovated rooms and nonrenovated rooms.

4132,Only stayed here for 1 night and it was excellent.  It's not in the centre of Berlin which is why it was so cheap but it was only 1 train station from the centre of Berlin and the train station was about a 3 minute walk.  It also came with breakfast and it had a large variety on the buffet.  Absolutely cannot complain about the price and what you get.  The room was quiet and clean and very modern.  The window view was not nice but then I wasn't in the centre of Berlin and I didn't spend hundreds of Euros.  I think all up I paid 79 Euros.  Has free WiFi.  I would highly recommend this hotel.,4

One evening we noticed the water in the room was brown. I reported it to the reception who said they will get staff to look at while we went out for dinner. On returning, no had been and the water was still brown. I reported it again and was told to run the water for 10 min to clear it. I let it run for over 15 mins and it still didn't clear.

The rooftop pool and bar is great but we were let down by the fact the staff could not bring us any towels for swimming and bar staff were very limited in English for ordering drinks .

There’s one guy at the reception who speaks good english, but the other service personal doesn’t understand the simplest words like “breakfast”. The room service is also too simple for a five star hotel. They just make the bed and give you new towels. It feels like they don’t realize the sticky table and drawer.

Breakfast was very good and had eggs and sausage, a load of bread and cheeses, salads, fruit, and several beverages.

A spotless pool and surrounds area but dirty and worn poolside mattress/bed covers and pillows. A spotless albeit fairly basic bedroom but a shower which has seen far better days and has large areas of mould on its walls. I cannot understand why all the previous reviews don't mention this. It's the biggest let down of all. Definitely would not pass health and safety inspection. A plentiful self serve breakfast with attentive coffee table service but no fresh fruit, only tinned peaches, and repetitive offerings of cold meats and cheese, sliced fresh bread (no bread rolls), lukewarm scrambled eggs, sausage or bacon. Such a shame as the staff are indeed fantastic and deserve all the praise heaped on them, but the owners do need to upgrade urgently.…",3

4154,"I  had a really bad experience staying here. The hotel feels claustrophobic as the rooms are gloomy and the public areas are small with no outside area and no pool. Each day I witnessed and experienced queues at the front desk, especially at midday when the queue went right round to the lifts! Guests were constantly returning with room keys that didn't work.  The rooms are varying shades of brown and beige; gloomy! The bathroom tiny with dirty grout between the tiles and thin, hard off-white towels! There is no spy hole in the door to identify who is outside and in spite of having my ""please make up room"" light illuminated and a card on the door handle to the same effect, I was in my room when a message came under my door from housekeeping saying they could not service my room…",2

It was quite cold in the room, no extra duvet. The smell coming from the bathroom was quite bad. Lots of drunken tourists on the street, so the room facing the street was very noisy.  I suppose this hotel is OK for one night.",2

Upon my arrival I was given a smoking room as all other rooms were taken. When I requested to speak with the Manager, I was told he is not available on weekends. They assured me however, that a room should be available the next day and I will be re-located.  The next day, I was re-located, however the air condition was not working properly. I requested to be moved again and the same response “No manager on duty and no available rooms.” After much complaining I was given another room.  Of all the three rooms, the bedrooms was quite small but the bathrooms was okay.   The up side to this hotel…",3

The only problem the hotel needs to fix is the water from the shower. Everyday when my wife and I used it the water turns out either hot or cold. We did not have a good experience with shower. The rest was good. I wouldnt stay again in this hotel just because of the shower. That’s why I give an overall rate as average.",3
4164,"The room is cozy and the location is perfect and very quiet. We can go on foot to the famous station Friedlichstrasse. (Here is a good chinese restaurant.) The kitchen in the room is very useful to us.  The breakfast has a wide choice, but there is not an omelet, but boiled eggs. Though we ordered it, but the waiter said, we can not. It was a little bit unfortunate. ",4

The staff was friendly but it was extremely difficult to communicate with them because of their lack of language skills (English). I really had expected more from an international hotel.  My room included a kitchenette as well as a balcony - which both of them could not be used. The room itself also could need an upgrade with regard to ""Value for Money"". What could have been nice to have was a comfortable armchair to relax in when watching television instead of sitting in the bed.  The breakfast buffet was comprehensive on asian food. However the poor choise of international food for breakfast - and the fact that they served exactely the same every morning - made the…",2

Yes - the hotel seemed busy however a smile costs nothing and as for the 2 older gentlemen behind the concierge desk I felt as if I was intruding by asking for assistance before being summarily dismissed. Housekeeping was inconsistent - on check in there were 2 bottles of water in the room. The second day there was 1 and the third say none at all. Reception were friendly and efficient as were the bar staff.",2

The room was clean, spacious and the bed was heavenly. We had the best time in this hotel. The location is great, very close to many attractions and the lovely neighborhood of Opéra. The staff was super friendly and very helpful.  One piece of advise if you're coming by car. Book a parking spot in the Saint Lazare parking under the trainstation and do it in advance. It'll save you quite some money :)  Thank you very much staff of Idol Hotel, you made our weekend perfect!",5

Four of us (two adults and two pre-teens) stayed in one room (double bed and two singles).  The location was convenient to transportation hubs at Alexanderplatz, which is a 1-2 minute walk from the hotel. Shopping and family-friendly dining was close. We ate breakfast at the hotel, which had the usual selection of cold meats, cheese, cereal, pastries, juice, and hot beverages. If we return to Berlin, we would consider staying here again.",5

The purported reason was that patients from the hospital that had surgery stayed over. They comped my room at the Crowne Plaza and acted like they were doing me a favor.

I got in the Hilton Honors line. There was only one person at the front desk, and she waited on TWO other people in the other line before she got to me. When I finally got up there, I asked about my Diamond perks, including a room upgrade and free breakfast.

The building itself is monolithic when viewed on arrival and just what you’d expect from Berlin. A short walk up the side walkway and the real hotel is revealed. A really cozy but cool reception, bar and bistro. Met by friendly and helpful staff who carried out a quick and easy check-in- no faffing around in Berlin! Room was nicely designed and laid out with adequate storage for the number of nights (3) we were spending there. Bathroom had a fantastic shower..just what was needed after travelling or “refreshing” from the night before...great way to blast away the hangover. In summary a really cool hotel with cool staff.",5

The room was clean, not too small like many options in the city, well planned and well decorated. A nice soft king size bed and pillows allowed us some very good resting nights after some long sightseeing journeys through the city.

Getting a drink in any part of the hotel is an ordeal! We waited over 40mins on our first night while watching 4 staff members chatting at the end of the bar with one poor bartender working her hardest.

We called again and they promised the same thing, no one came. In the morning i followed up again and they said they would only give water upon check in. We just moved to a suite, they did not oblige. And they could have just told us that they couldn’t bring us water instead of making us wait and wait.   Even upgrading to a suite was a bad experience.

But even if you reached way early enough,the trays for bread, fruit etc always remained empty and were never refilled.To the extent one day,we were told they had run out of bread as they had estimated lesser !!

Hotel itself is lovely. Clean, modern, spacious rooms and lovely helpful staff. Its a perfect place for couples but maybe not so much if you're bringing kids as the storage space in the rooms is limited. The roof top bar is wonderful with spectacular views.

4222,"I had worked at a different Meininger in Berlin in 2004 and knew that the accommodation would have been interesting for my young cousins travelling with me and my partner.  The room was neat (maybe a bit more light would have made it even better, though) and clean. Towels were changed every second day - we stayed there for 5 nights, and the room cleaned daily. Breakfast may seem too plain or always the same for some people, but the good thing is that you can choose whether to have it there or not. The location is perfect: Senefelder Platz U-Bahn station is directly in front of the entrance door, Alexander Platz is just two stops away, and there are heaps of restaurants to choose from in the neighbourhood.

The top of the tile surround was so dusty that it looked like a layer of fur!  The carpets were stained and worn out.  The tile floor was moldy.  The mattresses were stained and there was evidence of bed bugs.  The entire room smelled and the window treatments were broken and dirty.  The towels were stained and very thin.

The biggest issue we had was that we are vegan and went for a specific vegan yoga retreat, which we were disappointed about.  As for the food, the morning buffet was not marked vegan, and we were initially told some things were vegan and later found out they were not.  There ended up being only 1-2 vegan options, including granola and fruit, and the rest of the buffet consisted of meat, cheese, and non-vegan pastries.  The dinner options were limited and mediocre, and we were served one meal covered in cheese and another one commented it had lactose in it.

The location is outstanding on a beautiful tree lined street. The weather was appalling with pouring rain for two days  but on leaving the hotel complimentary umbrellas were given out which was a nice touch.

About the location , the hotel is a bit far from main attractions and metro station is about 10/15 minutes walk.

The pool on the roof was freezing but nice that it existed and the little bar up there is nice.  If they invest some money in rehabbing this place it could be lovely but it needs help.

They kept contacting me by phone to come up with all sorts of absurd reasons to explain why I will have to pay the extra amount.  2. The rooms were hit and miss. Whilst some were fine, others smelt of damp, one had a leaking AC and the third had a showerhead that was mouldy. This is very poor standards.  3. They asked me to pay a non-itemised room service charge!   The breakfast was nice and the staff were polite but…",2
4280,We were very happy with friendliness and professionalism of your staff. Room Service was excellent and well presented. The Hotel should have it's own Lounge / Bar though.  We will be back. Great location. Thank you. ,4
4281,"Lets start with the elevator. I had to bring my luggage 3 floors up by myself through narrow stairs because the elevator was broken. Fine, I'm a big man, I got it.  Then, I arrive at my room and the internet is soooo bad I can't even read my email. I ask the front desk about moving me to another room and they say that they can only do that during the day. I was on a business trip which meant I couldn't move cause I was at the office. And then, to make things worse, the heater broke... twice.  Oh, I have asked for a copy of my invoice because I need to expense it and I haven't gotten it. I've called twice. I would not recommend this hotel at all.",1
4282,"Stayed here with my young adult kids in chilly February.  The Hotel is superb, warm and friendly and with a generosity that is rare in city hotels. We ate in the restaurant where Adam looked after us so well, food was local, delicious and innovative.  Magical taste sensations.The location is perfect, we could walk to lots of bars and restaurants.  The room was funky and comfortable.  This is my go to in Berlin, I love it. Oh and check out the great sauna.....",5
4283,"The room is beautiful and clear, friendly service, the breakfast is very good, the location is very good: you can reach the restaurants, shops just by walking. So it is very closed to the inner city but the street of the house is still calm. You can rest here perfectly.",5

There are many loud, homeless people and trucks around the hotel at night.  The staff didn't consistently service the room.  I would not stay at this hotel again, even though it is a great location.",1
4285,We ended up stayed for five nights added on two as we liked this hotel so much. It’s newly refurbished and super clean . We had a superior room that was spacious with lovely interiors. Great bathroom with a powerful shower and separate loo. We found a superb deal online that included breakfast which was good quality. All the staff were lovely. Supermarket next door (Casino) very handy. They make great Sushi. Parking available at the Hotel for an extra charge. We had a safe in our room. We found a launderette five minute walk away. We found the room to be very peaceful. It’s about seven minutes to the beach and close to the main shops. We had a very relaxing massage at the sister hotel Cezanne. Would stay again. ,5
4286,This is our second stay in this hotel (first time was in 2010 and there is a review for that stay too). Stayed for 4 nights in June 2014.   Location: Central (10 minute walk to the centre). Beside the bus station so convenient public transportation access. Stayed in the marina facing room and had no issues with noise.   Room: The room was not as clean as it should have been when we arrived. But front desk was highly responsive and the issues were dealt with promptly. We were impressed with the customer service and we quickly forgot about the negative first impression. The bed was OK - a little firm but comfortable enough. The flat screen TV was very small with only a few channels and not great picture quality. The wifi connection was spotty.  Service: Everyone at front desk was…,3
4287,A nice hotel with friendly staff. Room was a little small and bathroom even smaller🤔. Breakfast was good. Located within walking distance from train station. Reception is well managed with all touristic info and also sells Bahn tickets saving you time and effort of buying at the train/bus stations. A coffee machine (€1.50 for a cup) and complimentary fresh fruits every evening are added attractions,4

If you like a good nights sleep do not stay here!! when I complained that I was kept awake all night by the slamming doors (which they have had complaints before) the only offered to refund me the resort tax....I would not recommend this hotel to my worse enemy!  the staff were rude and very unwelcoming, the showers where cold and the toilet didn't even flush properly. when addressed they were not interested.",1
4290,"Although the hostel is not exactly centrally located, public transport in Berlin cab get you there from almost anywhere in the city. We stayed at a Twin Room with a shared bathroom for 4 nights. The room was very clean (we were given the bed sheets upon checking in), as well as the shared bathroom. There was not much noise at night and breakfast was more than decent, with a rather wide selection of foods, including vegetarian ones. We were also able to store our luggages for free after having checked out, since we went back at the hostel to pick up our staff and catch out early flight. Minor drawback the fact that we had to pay the whole amount when we arrived, something not stated when we were booking. ",4
4291,Over all average accommodations at a very high cost. The location is isolated from the main restaurants and facilities such as pool and bar. The walk to the ocean was well over 20 minutes meaning you had to take your car. ,2
4292,"This place could be one of the best hostels I've been: great location, very helpful staff, very clean, comfortable rooms. But the extreme loud music volume all day long makes me not wanting to repeat a stay here. It seems somebody of the staff loves techno and disco 'cause it's all day very loud. Even if you get upstairs in the lounge it's impossible not to feel and hear the hard drum and bass.  Such a pity, it could be one of the best places!",3

4295,"Stayed here at the end of our trip all over Brazil and was not impressed. We arrived in beach clothes directly from a wonderful stay at Uxua in Trancoso and the guy at check in looked at us and approached us in a manner suggesting that we did not belong there. As we travel a lot and stay in many fabulous places, it is very seldom we encounter this behaviour which makes it stand out even more when it happens. We had a deluxe room facing the beach, which turned out to be interconnecting. We could hear everything being said in the next room through the interconnecting door which was unfortunate at best (would suggest you check this when booking to avoid). We tried the private beach in front of the hotel, but abandoned it quickly as there was a constant approach of people trying to…",2
4296,After checking in for this hotel at $750 per night we were kindly informed that the staff were on strike and that they would not clean the rooms and provide minimal other services. I would question the ethics and  professionalism of the hotel management and the staff who don't inform guests upon check-in. Not staying here again. Without service this is just an old building. AirBNB would have been better.,1
4297,I paid top dollar for this resort and was over run by a large convention.  No one told us when we booked the room we would be part of this experience.  I think it was a nice resort but couldn't enjoy it because of the spring break atmosphere with all their friends and friends friends. ,2
4298,"We stayed three nights. Staff was courteous and helpful. The rooms on both occasions were clean, comfortable, quiet and had good bathrooms.  The breakfasts were great. Most of all we took advantage of the hotel's proximity to the metro which made our Paris visit so easy!  We will come back to this hotel when we return to Paris.  Highly recommended.",5
4299,"A good, clean, quiet, safe  standard Ibis hotel ( small room but functional ) near the Zoo in Berlin. Very nice, friendly and helpful staff. Breakfast was good for me. AC was a problem as the room was stuffy at night. A fan might have helped. Excellent transportation nearby - 100/200 bus plus easy U Bahn station. Area good. ",4
4300,"I stayed one night at this hotel and couldn’t be more disapointed. The hotel is old and badly furnished. When I got to my room, I realized that it was not what I had booked (I payed for a queen size bed, and they had put me in a room with a single and impressively small one). Asking them to change rooms, I was provided with the apartment which I had booked. Again, it was a old, badly furnished room, with a tiny shower box, but this time, a bigger one, with a double bed. This time, another issue surfaced: the door only had a regular lock, and not the security lock that hotel rooms usually had. Being a young woman travelling alone, this aparently mild issue became a big one, and I wasn’t able to rest properly and felt unsafe during the time I was in the room.  Furthermore, when I…",2

Breakfast was terrible tasted like all frozen food I will never come back to this hotel they need to get a whole new staff even the door men was very unfriendly they refused to open the door for I had to search for my key with bags in my hand.,1

4304,"Yes, it is old but I love some of the older hotels in Chicago. I frequently stay at the Hilton, Palmer House and Congress Inn. Our room wasn't ready until an hour after check in time. I wouldn't sit in the chairs in the lobby because they looked so dirty. Only 3 people are allowed at one time in the one small elevator. We could take all that but the room just did not seem clean. The sheets were stained, there were dead bugs smashed on the walls and finger prints on the microwave. We could not feel comfortable there so changed hotels through Expedia. Just seemed gross to us.

It was very hot during our visit and the air conditioning was a welcome relief at times. Staff friendly and helpful. Celebrated a birthday during the visit and the bottle of bubbles was a nice surprise. Would recommend the hotel for anyone wanting to visit Berlin.",4

4308,We booked this place through hotels.com and got placed in the Africa room. Apparently it is the smallest room they have. The room has no exterior windows. You have to step down and walk down a short hallway to get to open deck where coffee maker and refrig are.  The bathroom requires quite a step down and switch is not close to door. We have both hit our knees and shins on the bed that has a hidden wooden frame that is longer than the mattress . We are very disappointed especially since it was recommended by our guide book and reviews.,2

After stating we wanted a double room we were told the hotel was fully booked and it wasn't until we pulled up an email stating we had booked a double luxury room that one magically became available to us. After that experience the hotel was lovely, a beautiful room and great service however lunch is only served for 2.5 hours and food is not 24hr available which is poor considering a 4 star hotel. However had a pleasant stay would also expect better due to outside tram works outside the hotel which looked appalling. Would rate 6/10",3

However, I'm writing this feedback because the taxi driver tried to scam me for the ride to the Airport. This taxi was waiting in front of the hotel and is probably well known by the concierge.  To make things simple, the taxi meter counted 57.4km for a 47.6km ride. +20%. How much do the hotel concierge get? It would be nice to make sure this taxi never go back to this hotel again. Taxi ID: 131001560805, License plate DX0859.  Given the prestigious image you're trying to convey, it would be good that at least the taxi you put your clients in are ""clean"".

We have received little gift in the room and I am not sure whether it was sorry for the wait or my gold membership but it was nice. I have asked for more toiletries for a family of three but I was brought more toilet paper so I gave up pursuing that any further.

We booked this hotel specifically because of the wonderful memories I had of staying at the Warwick New York City, another branch of the official International Warwick chain of    ""boutique""-style hotels.  Unfortunately, immediately upon entering the front lobby - a tiny room off the sidewalk guarded by two glass doors which one must awkwardly open outward whilst struggling with luggage, etc - which consisted solely of a generic, cheap looking reception desk and not much else.

Nobody walks around the pool asking if you want drinks or food. There is just the one bistro available.

Breakfast was limited but sufficient. Pool area small but clean and a nice view out to the sea. We stayed in room 6 which had a nice pool and sea view.

One negative episode that happened to me is that when I got to the hostel, there was a person sleeping in my bed (that I had made) and the staff just gave me new sheets and told me to find another one.

The reception was almost hostile refusing the smallest of requests ranging from lending an adapter to fixing the phone in the room. Breakfast was very average and had a limited selection. The bathroom gave out a terrible stench which would not go away. The pool was full of leaves and quite unkempt. The hotel refused to call us any taxi except the hotel taxi which was at a 20-30% premium. The only other option was to walk 2 kms through the jungle to the main road to hail a cab.

My biggest complaint about the room is the 'King' bed - it was two single beds pushed together with separate sheets on both. Many hotels join two single mattresses to make a king so the rooms can be converted into twin rooms however at the OD this would be totally impractical as the room does not have a separate bathroom.

Next up the maids didn’t come until we had to call down after coming back from our pool at 5pm. Had to literally call 5 times. The hotel has a whole tv outage at some point. Service at the breakfast place sucked. The manager Ken promised us credits and when we got our final bill nothing was taken off. He also left us his card with his cell that conveniently didn’t work. Would never stay here unless I was desperate and needed a cheap place. Front desk is rude.,1
4345,Bad experience. Got over charged! Rude management. I BOOKED MY ROOM the same day as my friends. I booked on the hotels website and they booked on expedia. I paid 500.00 and they paid 350.00. I called the manger Zack and asked him to refund me the difference as we got identical rooms. He was not only non-helpful but making excuses about why I paid more for the identical room. The right thing to do would be to give me the credit or offer me a credit for a future stay! Not good for being in the customer service industry!,1
4346,"I spent a week at this hotel, the first night they put us in a room on a round-about!!! It was extremely noisy. We did manage to get moved at a considerable additional cost to us.    In our so called ""suite"" the kitchen units needed a good clean and were a bit shabby as was the bathroom. Certainly not four star in my opinion. There were a number of areas that could have done with a bit of attention i.e broken tiles in and around the pool.  On a positive note the assistant manageress was extremely helpful and thankfully to her my whole holiday was not ruined",3
4347,"This must have been state of the art Brazilian hotel back when it was opened back in 1975 but property upkeep has been neglected ever since.  Booked one of the premier rooms with ocean view that had plenty of space but only ocean view if you put your head out of the window and looked right. Wrong marketing.  Bedding was absolutely terrible. Bed was nothing that hotel calling itself a ""Palace"" should have. Hard and thin blanket. AC worked but was mainly ON/OFF only and nothing in between.  Morning only one person was working in the front desk. Left without checking out because would have taken too long to stand in line. Inadequate staffing.",2

This Hotel is very Ordinary - the Rooms are Ordinary, the food is very Ordinary. The ""Roof Terraces"" accessible to ordinary, Guests are very, very Ordinary.  Only some rooms look out on the Bay and it separate from just about every place that you want to be in SF. We can only guess that Guests who give it a higher rating have not been in a Luxury Hotel, or in a Boutique Hotel. The Hotel simply does not earn the credits that it gives itself.",1

4350,"Nice looking hotel, clean, and near convention center. But here comes the one star part: We were aware the parking fee was $36 a day.  We were here for the weekend so the parking was billed at $72. Ok. The problem is, we were billed for the parking on THE HOTEL ROOM BILL, and at the GARAGE when my husband took the car out of the parking structure.  $144 for two days parking? not OK.  I didn't notice the double billing until I got home and reviewed the hotel bill that was emailed to us (you don't see the bill at checkout.).  So now it's off to the races with calling the hotel, talking to the front desk , faxing the receipt, sitting on hold while the manager calls accounting, calling accounting two days later to check status, waiting for email from front desk, calling front desk…",1

4352,We stayed at the Ibis Styles Bogatell. This was easily accessed via the metro from the airport! (Recommend getting off at Maria and walking s little further rather than taking a third tube to Bogatell). The hotel was very clean and modern. Staff were nice but could have been a little friendlier at check in. The room lacked some basic things we missed such as a rack to dry our towels!! Also a fridge and coffee making facilities but there was a coffee station available in reception for free. Breakfast was a decent continental but could get very busy 9-10 so we started going a little earlier to avoid the crowds. The hotel was about 15-20 minute walk away from things you want to see but this wasn’t a problem for us and we used the metro every day which was hugely convenient - tubes…,4

4358,"I've been to Miami several times and stayed at this hotel plenty of times. This time will definitely be the last. When I come to check in, that's when the front desk manager Dorothy decides to tell me that the suite I originally booked has been sold out to someone else, and therefore they cannot give it to me anymore. I booked a whole month in advance - no calls, emails or anything to inform me that they sold my room to someone else. It is when I am here with bags that they decide to disclose this information.?? That to me constitutes a very poor way of doing business. I could never do such a thing to my clients. The best they can do is to put us ( a couple) in two separate rooms. Seriously?? Not going to book this hotel for any of my further trips to Miami.",1
4359,"This hotel is small but perfectly formed, clean and tidy and fast efficient check in time, we arrived early but were allowed to store the cases so we could go and look around ! The guy on reception told us about the sea food restaurants on the sea front and they didn't disappoint.   We were Pre warned about pickpockets but lots of police about the ramblas to make you feel very safe and secure.  I feel it's only honest to mention the few little problems we found, the mattress was mega hard and it did disturb my sleep, but I do have an artificial hip and this hard mattress kept waking me up every time I turned onto  my left side which didn't help towards a good nights sleep !  (The other three people In my party also mentioned the hard mattresses so maybe it wasn't just my hip)…",4
4360,"My mother stayed here for a week while my child and I stayed down the road at another hotel.  My mother added me to her room and gave us a key to her room so we could meet up at her hotel room.  This was the worst elevator I have ever been on!  When you do your card key, you have to figure out that it assigns you an elevator but it can have one elevator door opened right in front of you and if that is not your assigned elevator and you get on it, it does not stop at your floor.  You have to get off the elevator and then 'call' the elevator again and to get to your floor.  And you better be prefect when using the elevator otherwise you will pay!  For example, when we left my mother's room, we decided to go to the bottom floor and entered that floor prior to getting onto the…",2
4361,"So I had booked a week at this place for myself and my mum as part of a dream holiday we are having in Canada and the US and this place turned out to be a nightmare. A poor room to begin with, sprarse and dull, was compounded with it being very noisy from the outset. Then, during the first and only night we ended up staying, my mum's bed was infested with BED-BUGS which resulted in her being bitten throughout the night and waking up with bites all over. In addition, the shared toilet was in this only night covered in human faeces in and outside the bowl. Of course the next morning we went to the reception and complained. We were met with a cold response and told the room would be changed within an hour. This was not done, so we went down to speak with them again. At this point,…",1

From the moment I stepped into the hotel, the front desk agent couldn't not find my reservation even after I provided them with my confirmation number. As a result they somehow created an extra reservation for me.   When I received my bill, there was a ""fraudulent"" bar charge that was never incurred by my in the 2 hours I stayed there. After calling the property to correct the issue, they investigated and said the charge was incorrect and would refund my card. This has been two weeks ago and still no refund. After calling them again, they said there was no note of this incident.   After calling the Platinum desk, I found they charged me for two nights instead of one.   I am a platinum…",1

However for the modern traveller looking to create memories and experiences the hotel is cold and outdated. The staff is very formal and seems te be more concerned with their internal processes then causing their guests to have a good time.  Strickly pressing you for your room number when you arrive for breakfast... is that really necessary? Why not first greet and then ask for the number?  We had asked for help with Some tourist activities before arriving and the mail was most kind but no help was given when we arrived.   So My advice: stay here for one night to experience the beautiful building and then Go to a place where the Guest is…",2

We depend strongly on the internet and the wifi connection was great, just remember each connection needs a seperate password.  Don't worry its free, just ask the desk.  The prices on the rooms vary, depends on your needs but they have great prices. First check with hotels.com and other networks. Will stay there again.  Great value.",5
4366,"We stayed in Vintage Lisboa for a long weekend. The location is very good, downtown in the city centre. The hotel itself is pretty nice, modern and clean. But for a 5star hotel there are simply missing some features. Our room (suite) was nice furnished, but that was it. There was nothing special to upgrade the room in terms of decoration elements add ons like magazines, books, fresh flowers, fruits or some nice snacks and beverage available in the suite. Service was ok but could be better.  Nowadays its simply not enough to have nice decoration in a price range of this particular hotel. All in all the stay was ok but there are better hotels in Lisbon in this price category.",3
4367,DO NOT GO TO THIS HOTEL THEY WILL FIND A WAY TO SCAM YOU TOO. In August 2018 my sister and her boyfriend came to visit me and had a reservation for the Nob Hill Inn. The cab driver mistakenly took them to The Nob Hill Hotel.  The receptionist told them the reservation from booking.com wasn't showing on their system and asked to see the paper copy of the reservation. Despite reading THE DIFFERENT NAME OF THE HOTEL he went ahead and decided to scam them telling them that he could give them the same room at the same price and charge them directly instead of via booking.com  My sister and her boyfriend were still unaware that was the wrong hotel and when they checked out they were charged both from the original hotel that kept the room for them (which makes sense) and from the Nob…,1

Brilliant Apartments is now my first choice of places to stay in Berlin, and I will recommend it to all of my friends.",5

About twice the size of a briefcase.  The bathroom was also small, as was the closet.  We had no way to unpack.  I went to the front desk to ask for assistance and the manager offered me a suite for an additional 300 dollars a night.  That would have been an additional two thousand dollars for basic accommodations that are available in every other hotel.  They have to take better care of guests staying for longer than a night or two.  I would have changed hotels but it was already paid in advance.  We literally lived out of our suitcases.  That's not five star service.",1

The housekeeper came in and wrinkled her nose, then was going to spray some stuff at the drain, which was the point I was on the way downstairs for a room change, which I was graciously given.  (More on this later). My new room was worse, smaller and on the noisy street hotel front.  Rather dingy, all the place needed was an elevated subway running by and a flashing neon sign lighting the room.  Two days out of six nobody serviced the room.  Nonetheless, if you are on a budget and complain more than I did, the hotel is a serviceable and well located place. The staff, on the other hand, was great.  Front desk, concierge-- helpful,…",2

4375,My company had prepaid my hotel room in advance this was noted when I checked in by clerk. She then asked for a credit card for incidentals which I gave her my personal credit card. While checking in she noted that I would be emailed my statement which was acceptable by me. When I got the statement it was charged to my personal credit card in addition to my company card so I was double charged. I immediately called the hotel and I have called back several times only to leave messages. No one will take my call in person. It has been two weeks and this is not been resolved. ,1

The air conditioner was loud and emitted an odor. I have a bad back and the bed made it worse. There is no headboard just a concrete wall. The small chair was very uncomfortable. They only give you one small soap so you need to move it between the sink and the shower. The sink has a wooden shelf hanging over it making it impossible to wash your face or shave without hitting your head or getting the floor soaking wet. The elevators are small and very slow. Cleanliness was an issue. It was so bad that we opted to buy our way out which cost us one night at $600 plus a $10 early check out fee. When we were in the elevator another guest…,1

It's a 24/7 kind of place -- the breakfast area turns into a club at night with drinks & music. I thought the night scene was over the top -- the bouncers were rude and patronizing, but during the day the staff is quite friendly.   Nothing is included in your stay - so be prepared to pay for breakfast/snacks. I would have liked a common refrigerator to keep somethings cold. They don't allow food in the rooms.   What this hostel lacks in coziness it makes up for in location.",3

The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful with directions and recommendations.  The rooms are on the smaller side, as is customary in European cities, but were nicely decorated and spotless.  We would gladly return here for another Paris holiday",5

4403,The hotel was very good. Everything was easy to reach on foot. The staff was very friendlyWould book the hotel again anytime. The rooms were clean and for England very nice and bigust around the corner there are bars as well as Restauratns. Shops are also within easy walking distance,5
4404,"Stayed here for three long nights on the 31st floor, felt like the ventilation system wasn’t cleaned in years. Got a mild throat infection because of this place!  As a loyal Marriott member i can say this is the worst property i have stayed at in terms of indoor air quality and front office desk service.  Asked for an mobile air filter for the last night which got delivered immediately but only helped a little bit. Staff did not offer other solutions to help out.  The housekeepers were nice but other staff seemed generally disengaged and unhelpful. E.g we checked in at 2pm and were told the room would be ready soon but when we returned at 5pm it was still not ready and were told to wait longer.  Amenities and other services were on par but still wouldn’t recommend this place...  ",2
4405,"The hotel and facilities are good but the quality of the food and drinks are not acceptable. Having been here for 10 days I am very disappointed. I have read other peoples reviews and the managements responses and would have expected something to have been done about it. The drinks are average at best but mostly very poor, the food is of poor quality, not very warm and not a very good selection. Before management respond please try a meal for yourself. As for the specialist restaurants I don't really consider a restaurant open on one day of the week as an alternative. We have spent a couple of nights out in Funchal just so we can have a decent meal and a good bottle of wine.  There is no way that this is a 5 star hotel. You have one bar open at night with two staff, should it…",3
4406,This hotel is in a fantastic location close to many attractions .  The room we had on the third floor was clean and comfortable. Due to the sloping roof would not suit a tall person as I bumped my head frequently and I’m not that tall. There are no tea coffee facilities in the room .  The shower is adequate but there is no shelf in the bathroom to put toiletries. The breakfast whilst adequate was very basic and often the hot food was cold . There is not a lot of choice so be prepared for that .  There is no bar in the hotel but plenty locally. All in all not bad .,3

The reception had a tantrum because we did not have my sons Visa card of his he paid for it he spoke on the phone was sending a copy of it our bank would talk to him but they Quoted hotel policy nothing would do so I paid for the hotel 2 time on my card they them messed up our room numbers and one nice customer care person Isobel had to fix that up while we waited 1 1/2 hours to get in to our room. The reception lady Carla C . Was nasty person I’ve ever met in dealing with customers.   The hotel was in need of a big overhaul as you see from photos of our room. The bath was impossible to fill with its old taps not mind say leaning around the shower screen. the wardrobe had a wall in it so you…,3

Yes, the rooms are tight, but that is to be expected in Paris and how much time are you in the room anyways, right?  The beds were very comfortable and the front desk staff was always very helpful, especially at check-in. We felt very welcomed.  The area is not as lively as some others but there is still no lack of places to eat and we even did our laundry down the street where the woman working there was very helpful to us (our basic French from high school was put to good use). It is close to metro lines so it takes no time at all to get wherever you need to go.  The breakfast area is in the basement which gave a unique feel with all the stone/brick walls. …",5
4409,"Stayed here for the Mobile World Congress event. Location is only a few minutes from the Diagonal train station, and is a quiet, mostly locals neighborhood with numerous restaurant options close by. The Deluxe room was plenty large-especially for Barcelona. Very clean and well laid out too. Bed was a proper full size bed (not 2 singles pushed together) which was much appreciated. Plenty of hot water and pressure was very good. The free Wi-Fi worked well. Breakfast buffet was what you'd expect, and was well-stocked. The staff was cheerful, helpful and responsive. Definitely recommend. ",4

We used the laundry services of the hotel and some clothes came back shrunken. We told the staff our complaint and they were not helpful at all. The guy at the desk even told me I lied and that it was my own fault that the clothes got shrunken, because I shouldn't iron and washed it myself... Uh..  Hello... I gave it to your laundry service. Despite the beautiful location we will not book a room in this hotel anymore.",2

Our first impression of the Congress Plaza was great; it had a great location and beautiful lobby. Also, the bellmen were helpful and friendly. That is the end of the positive things I have to say. Upon check-in, we found that they had cancelled our reservation. Mistakes happen, and we weren't upset. They did end up getting us a room that was available. Unfortunately, there was no apology or even politeness from the front desk. They acted as if we were an inconvenience. Our room was old, had peeling paint chips on the floor, and had weird modern-style furniture mixed with old-century…",1

We like to charge our devices during our time away, but our second room keys were removed for some reason.   The tea & coffee in the room was not restocked.....and I used this as the coffee machine in the breakfast area was broken.   Breakfast nice & simple.  ",3
4415,"Friendly staff greeted us and were helpful during our whole stay, suggestings restaurants, excursions and even finding an open laundromat. But for the hefty price they charge, many things were just ok - substandard cleanliness, mediocre breakfast which we quickly tired of, and the pool was either extremely dirty or closed during our 5-day stay (a large reason for choosing it). Very disappointing. Our two girls of 8 and 12 loved having their own adjoining room with bathroom though. We enjoyed the people, but we wouldn't stay there again",2
4416,"Stayed here while in Amsterdam a few days and was not impressed at all. Room was clean but rather small and overpriced for it not to be in the city center. Breakfast was average, nothing to rave about. The staff was friendly and helpful during our stay which was also a plus and there is a bus stop out front if you want to travel into the city center instead of taking a taxi whic can get a little pricey if done on a daily basis. Personally wouldn't recommend this place to anyone nor would I stay here again if ever in Amsterdam.",3
4417,"I spent 5 nights at the Coconut on a business trip.  The hotel is just OK: clean and more or less conveniently located for Waikiki.  However, it feels very old, with many layers of (shiny) paint, peeling off at places, like a cheap motel.  The windows don't close tight, so you hear all the noise from the street --and it faces a very busy street--, so you end up waking up at 2 a.m. by music blasting from cars: not nice at all. The breakfast is also just OK, with mini-waffles, pastries, fruit salad and cold cereal.  They also had some mushy yellow stuff that was labelled ""eggs"", but it tasted like eating a sponge, and I wasn't the only guess that threw it away (and I _never_ throw food away).  I guess I shouldn't complaint, since the breakfast was ""complimentary"" (well, after…",2
4418,"Viceroy Chicago charged so called ""resort fee"" during check-out, claiming just using WiFi would trigger the fee, even though we did not use their gym or other facilities. It also charged $72 for overnight parking of a regular size car, even though nearby same-class hotels charge only $40. Water from the faucet had very strong chlorine taste. Otherwise, the hotel's location is fine, room was small but adequate. Bed was relatively comfortable. With so many hotels nearby providing similar quality, within the same price point but do not charge ""resort fee"", I would not stay in Viceroy Chicago again.",1
4419,We arrived early before our Check In time & Valerie was there greeting us with a Warm Welcome. Before hand she did also helped us arranged Airport Transportation & responded to our messages very promptly. We are so Lucky that she even helped us to stay in the same room for our nights because our actual reservation required us to move after the 1st night.  Rooms are very nice & clean. Hotel has The Best & Safe Location just 10 Minutes away from Eiffel Tower & the Most Tasty Bakery Les Gourmandises d’ Eiffel.

Picture a lobby filled with a maelstrom of humanity sitting on the floor, a man sleeping on the only couch in bare feet and a swirl of video game playing loud locals enjoying a Sunday afternoon in the lobby.   I booked a room on Agoda but when I arrived I found the only wireless is in the lobby unless you pay $50 more per night and upgrade to a room with the same filthy carpet but a new desk and shower.  The man checking me in said use the wireless in the lobby.  But the only seat was the couch with Mr bare feet sprawled out and the vision of sitting near that horror story was more than I could manage.  I paid the $50.

Having visited Rio many times I have not yet found what I would call a good hotel. Standards are generally low compared to other locations around the world and central Rio hotels seem to trade on their location and don't try very hard to justify their cost and this is another one. Room small, tired, fairly clean but quite basic. Feels like a run down apartment building. Breakfast limited and uninspired. Did not try dinner here but plenty of good places nearby. Service was un-enthusiastic. I will continue to try to find a good hotel in Rio and am unlikely to return to this one.",2

Interesting mix of people staying in the hotel and coming in for drinks.   The room is small but we were aware of that but is really comfy and clean. The social areas are so nice downstairs that I'd prefer to have a drink there anyway.  Breakfast was delicious. €15 pp. brilliant selection of things and the nicest buffet breakfast I've ever had ,5
4425,Paper wall hotel. You can hear aby little sound or noise from neigbhors. The doors are non insulation - you hear every step at the corridor.. Very noisy AC. The windows in 1st floor are locked(if to open - you can get fine 100$). Windows view is to another building in 2m. Super small rooms.,1

I’d regard the Rio and Salvador (do Carmo) in Pelourinho as budget hotels. Rio we paid about £75 a night and Salvador was about £40 a night.   Given the architecture and location of the converted convent it could and should be stunning. The place felt a little on the dirty and grubby side. Pool area quite a depressing place, you wouldn’t want to linger. Pool furniture stained, bird poo over it and generally worn and shabby. The whole courtyard felt neglected.

Entering the room the window air conditioner mounted on the wall couldn’t keep up with the outside temp and humidity.  Room smelled of mildew/mold and nastiness. Towels and wash cloths stained and grey; look like bought used from a car wash.  Fortunately the temp and humidity were down on nights 2 and 3 so I opened the window to get fresh cool air.  Carpet in room and hallways filthy and worn.  This place is a dump and would never come back.  ",1

The staff were all friendly and did their best to be helpful.  Nevertheless, it wasn't a hotel I would stay at again. Our first experience was waiting in the lobby for a good 5-10 minutes before anyone appeared at the Front Desk.

4437,"You get everything you need for a nice stay.  The only drawback is the lack of air con in every room.  It is located close to the main attraction  The only drawback is the lack if car park.  My advice is to park your car in private paid car park nearby rather than on the street.  We were 95% sure it was a legal street car park but we still got a ticket.  It is all in Spanish and we hardly figure out what to do.  We were told by the local to pay the fee at any ticket vending machines but after a few months, we still got another ticket mailed to me.  In order to avoid all these hassle, I would suggest you to pay more and avoid the street car park unless you are 100% sure how the system works",4

However it is not on the main avenue but some 200 metres up a side road so make sure your taxi driver knows where he is going, this was a slight problem on all of our taxi rides.  Although public transport is close, the walk down to the main part of Lisbon is over a mile long which is quite a long way back up after a full day . If we go to Lisbon again we would look for a hotel closer to the river.",3

The WiFi dropped out frequently and was virtually useless. The hot water took 5 minutes to kick in. Breakfast was chaotic and ordinary; stale bread and dry fruit amongst mainly pork based noodle dishes.   Staff were pushy and demanding. On arrival they pushed on to us an expensive all day boat trip to various local oyster farms and gift shops. The trip didn't include any locations anyone would really want to visit on Phu Quoc.

Of course nobody expects better with so cheap room price.  The big minus comes from the shower room. It was clean but smelled like a cellar or dungeon. I guess there is some sort of moisture problem somewhere.",2

If you are a gold member, they offer you an extremely expensive upgrade to get access to the executive lounge not worth it. Their final bill is extremely difficult to understand .

This was my main frustration as there was no room service or ability to get food to the door when I was jet lagged and working long hours - if they hadn’t blatantly lied it might be better on the overall impression. I was told I could order food and come down and get it, from where I don’t know. Soft drinks in the club area were warm. The buttons in one of the elevators were dodgy. No toilet brush in the rooms, low quality soap and disposables. Only option to purchase refreshments was really complicated despite a lot of staff standing around downstairs.

We have never written a bad review before but when the staff asked our opinion on the hotel the language barrier made it hard to explain. Hopefully this will help...  Firstly, it always seemed to be short staffed or they were just in the wrong place. The rooftop bar never had anyone available until we mentioned we would be up there. The restaurant had to have a couple of chefs called in just to cook two dishes for us. We didn’t mind waiting but this made us feel so awkward.

Also, housekeeping didn’t come during the 9 hours we were out and had to be called thus interrupting our getting ready to go out for dinner. Plus apparently noise abatement is not used around the windows as car alarms, emergency vehicles and noisy walkers interrupted our sleep. On the positive side, the common areas of the hotel were very clean, modern and inviting. Also all staff encountered were extremely friendly and helpful. ",1
4449,"Not the best stay in a 5* hotel I'm afraid. We were there on a work trip. Rooms were very nice, however breakfasts were very average. It was set up in another room for our group and the food certainly didn't hit the 5* mark. We snuck into the hotel opposite for breakfast one morning where the rest of our group were staying. It was far superior. Even more disappointing was the fact that they wanted to charge us €5 to use the pool. At the rates we must have been paying this was  disgraceful.  Again, we ended up using the pool at the opposite hotel, the Epic Sana. Rooftop infinity!!! It was great. If I had the choice again I would much rather spend my money and stay at the Epic Sana next time.",3

This is higher than most Vegas resorts, and seems like a blatant way to bilk customers. Very unexpected from a Starwood property. The poor woman at the front desk had three people yell at her about it while I was waiting in line. The management exploits customers, but makes the hardworking staff take the brunt of it.",1

I asked for the sheets to be changed while I was out at dinner - never happened.  I asked again - still no clean sheets.  I ended up sleeping on top of the covers the two nights I was there since I never got clean sheets.   Thanks to the great location, the view from the roof top pool is great.

This was my second stay and I think this is is really sad because for sure the location of the hotel is perfect and the staff is superb, pleasant and well trained, everyone speak good english (rare in Brazil). If you are looking for a good and safe place, this is anyway a good choice.

We had a couple of maintenance issues but the lady in reception did a great job in ""de stressing"" any issue. Agree on other comments on the breakfast, the staff try but it is a shamble from the running through to the quality.

However, the other guests (a group which I could not identify), the external noise coming from a bar close to the hotel and men at work crossing the street starting 11:30 pm up to 3:30 am the whole week, associated with the very poor room sound-avoidance acoustic finishing transformed this trip into one of the very bad experience while traveling for business I ever had.",2
4466,Stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. Stayed in the deluxe superior room. I was taken back at first as it was small but I got use to this and checked other hotel room sizes and they are all small in Paris. The hotel is only a 2 star hotel but it was very clean the bed was very comfortable the reception staff were very helpful especially Johan. Breakfast was so big could not believe this. Once you left the hotel there where many places to eat or have a coffee or you could walk to the main square. This hotel is a credit to the management and staff.,5

Upon checking into the Hilton O’Hare, I immediately noted that there was not a smile to be had by anyone at the front desk. The lineup for check ins was huge and even though there were at least five people behind the front desk only two were serving customers.

We were happy with most of the positive reviews and thought it could be a good option once there was nothing else available there.  When we got to the hotel the reception guy started by doing something that is ILLEGAL here in Portugal. They made a copy of our electronic ID cards. We told them this was illegal and that they could not do it but they said everyone still did it and went on doing it anyway without considering our request not to. This alone set it all off in a bad foot. They are not serious and professional.  To amount to that, the room didn't have the minimum comfort for even a 3 star hotel, let alone 4.

As soon as you get off the elevator to your floor, there is this weird and distinct smell. Kinda smells like green tea, but more putrid.  Breakfast came with my package deal, but I chose not to eat. However, I did stop by just to fill up my water bottle. The waiter accused me of getting amenities from the breakfast area without paying.  First of all, I already had the breakfast package. Second, I didn't have any breakfast. Just water. Yep just water.

I speak Spanish and love developing respectful and happy relationships with people everywhere I go. Most of my reviews rave about how amazing the staff are wherever I have stayed.  This is the exception. This might be my first bad review ever.   We were so excited to stay here during our honeymoon in Argentina and I'm sad to say we were very disappointed. The staff at this hotel are overall indifferent and rude until you start to provide really generous tips.

The Martinez offers excellent staff, and service, beautiful clean rooms, and a great buffet at a beautiful outdoor dining area.  My wife and I can't stand old and moldy hotels.  Some of the the more established hotels in Cannes, like the Carlton, might be better known, but they smell old too. If you like new and fresh, this is the best choice in Cannes.",5

We decided to upgrade to a special room and stayed in the Johnny Jukebox room. First impressions of the hotel were great, however our room was very under-whelming. It looked good, however was really quite grubby. There were stains on the window seat cushions, a lot of dust and loads of hairs on the bed from the decorative throw.  No tea or coffee making facilities or drinking water were available either and everything was made of MDF so felt very cheap.

First, the positives: while not in a particularly swinging part of town, it is very convenient to transport. You can get to the Messe in 30 mins, easy, just have to switch trains once. And Kurfurstendamm is only two stops on the U-bahn.   The room was much nicer than I thought it would be - new and large. Good amenities, a real hairdryer, and a coffee maker. The chocolates in the room were delish. The reception staff are lovely. Breakfast was good and there was a nice selection of newspapers to read.   What let it down slightly: no housekeeping during my two day stay, just never happened. And their bar has one of the all time obnoxious bartenders. Much too busy chatting away to refresh…",4

Clearly unacceptable. Not to be adviced.,3

Even if you have a suite you are basically in a small cave with one small window  2.we were told there was 34 rooms but only 18 sun beds so unless you make a plan you are sitting in a chair looking at the sun 3. For a 5 star resort the TVs were tiny and if you are English speakers then you have a choice of CNN or CNN which is unacceptable for a quality hotel have they not heard of satellite TVs 4.also as an animal lover the stray cats on the premises are treated very badly they should either be fed by the hotel or looked after in a home the hotel gets enough money off the customers to more than pay for this Lastly it's a lovely place as a novelty for a…,3

Reception staff friendly and helpful. Location was okay. We walked all over Berlin from here.  There was a conference on while we were there and one day when we returned to the hotel we were told we could not get into the hotel for about 30 minutes due to the expected arrival of some important person.

It had the tone and insinuation of suggesting that we were at the wrong hotel and should not be there. Not only was this mortifying, but it was down right rude. Once the check-in was resolved, he told us that no rooms were available and they would call us when a room was available. We were early, so it was ok.

4494,"This was the fifth hotel I tried to book, as the previous four had no vacancies. We found out it was a long weekend in Amsterdam.  We thought it was quite expensive for what it was but maybe this was due to the scarcity factor pushing up the price.  The room was very small, did to have a  fridge or minibar and did not have air-conditioning which was a bit uncomfortable as it was quite a hot night.  The hotel is in a good position and it is easy to walk to most places in the central city.  It is a bit quirky and has a feeling of a traditional Dutch building being very narrow with a scary spiral staircase - there is a lift too so no problems with luggage. The staff were helpful and the breakfast was nice.",3

If you stay, ask to stay on a low floor and use the stairs, as the elevators are wonky. We actually got stuck in the elevator for an hour, until the elevator company came to free us. Modern  furnishings, but attention to details like only scalding water coming out of the bidet, outlets not working, and handles falling off of doors really detracted from the charm. Great location. Great staff.  But worrying about getting stuck in an elevator or scalding delicate parts on the bidet made it more of a commedy of errors than the romantic getaway as we hoped.",2

The room was not as clean as before especially the toilet and shower room in general. When checking in and out electronically the system failed (as it did on the 1st visit).

The sink was tiny - like what you see in an airplane bathroom  with a light over it that was so dim you could not actually use it to see in the mirror.  And it was the only mirror in the room.  The pool is tiny.  Dont let the photos on their website fool you - its the size of a postage stamp with chairs jammed all around it.   And then there is the $30 resort fee.  Was told this was for ""beach towels"" and ""housekeeping"".  Since when at a ""luxury"" hotel does housekeeping cost extra.  Just insane.

The motel itself has a 24 hour check in with a bar and breakfast (not included). The room itself was serviced daily and had a separate toilet from the bathroom. The bed was super comfortable and had a couch and a small table with chairs (suite). It is definitely worth booking the suite. The room was renovated.

The room change took six hours and then to my amazement this room was bang appositive the construction site. When I told the management they to my shock said we thought you meant the other side.

4519,We stayed 4 nights here at the end of March and the hotel was fantastic. The rooms etc were very comfortable and very clean. The breakfast was great even for fussy eaters. The staff were very polite and extremely helpful. The hotel is in a great position for all public transport. Would highly recommend a visit.,5
4520,"We really liked the hotel. The staff was friendly and helpful and the entire stay very pleasant. Having the Metro in a walking distance is convenient too. I can recommend to stay in this hotel. If I ever have another opportunity to go to Paris, I'll take this hotel into consideration.",5

4522,"Room was in a back ally , you have to keep curtain closed at all time , very tiny but at least quite far from the noisy street of the front. Not much space to put our two carry on . The closet has robs , sleepers and other stuff which doesn't leave much room for clothes . When we asked the housekeeper to remove the heavy cover from the bed , she stuffed it on top of our clothes , we moved it into the bathroom and left, when we returned we found it back in the closet on top of our clothes .",3
4523,"There is one thing in China, one must know. Operating a swimming poolis quite a costly affair. A lot of hotels would advertise a pool on their website. Once, you arrive there, you'll find out that the pool is closed - officially due to maintenance.   Well, I have hoped that a Pullman-branded hotel would not resort to such tricks. So, a friend of mine called in the day before and asking whether the pool is open. He got a yes.  After I checked in and wanted to get ready for a swim - surprise, surprise. The pool is - officially - closed for maintenance - what a coincidence. After I complained that staff suddenly could not speak English anymore.",2
4524,"One week out of two have passed:  Negative:  1. Mould in the bathroom. Easy to clean, not done. 2. Reception staff does not act that they are solving the problems that occur. We needed to clean our bathroom in the evening because of food poisioning in one restaurant (not at the hotel), but the reception did not have the keys to the cleaning wagons placed on all floors....?!? 3. Bed pillows worn out, needs replacement. 4. Noisy street in the back of the hotel.  Positive:  1. Breakfast staff very friendly.  2. Pool is well taken care off each morning. 3.

I asked the front desk to change my room, I was moved to a bigger room on the second floor. Initially, the room looked clean but after a quick inspection I saw the famous dirty black marks on the walls, the desk in room was dusty, towels in the bath room full of hair, the smoke alarm in the room was dirty and dusty.

Booked a 2 room standard apartment at Belmar Spa and resort. Paid 1650 Euro including an extra bed and breakfast.  The place is just beautiful, well planned with friendly staff. So what went wrong?  A. Does the name or even the description indicate that this is an apartment hotel - No! B. In the room description there is a line that says this type of room is cleaned only 2 times a week C.

4528,"We spent three wonderful nights at the hotel.  The staff was exceptionary.  They gave helpful recommendations,  made reservations, gave directions. They gave us water bottles every time we left and returned.  It was a rainy week and they provided large umbrellas.  We were provided electric socket converters and a free mini bar.  The room was not large, but I did not expect that in an European hotel.  Very convenient to the Metro.",5

The mini fridge was very disguising inside.  There was food , hair, hairclip on the carpet. The sheet is so old and full of dark spots that feels it hasn’t been washed for weeks. The same for the towels.  I didn’t feel comfortable at all.  ",1

Then when we were departing the girl wanted to charge us again for the room when we had paid cash on arrival, Then to top it off once we returned home my friend had noticed that the hotel had taken another large payment out her bank. Really not good enough as it will take 3 to 5 working days for the payment to go back in to the bank. I have experienced this before with large hotel chains such as the Hilton and it really does puts me off staying with them again.",3

We were very disappointed with the self catering room... only 2 hobs that didn't work a VERY loud fridge and a sink... no kettle no microwave , basic things that I just expected to be there after we had paid extra for the room.... There is a lovely bar over the road up some stairs to the left that mad medium beers for 1 euro... lovely staff and the takeaway nextdoor was lovely and always busy. Also I enjoyed m mango daquri from up the street ;) definitely try one of those. Had a fantastic bakery opposite too. The hotel is very clean rooms done daily.

4534,"The Taj's exclusive offer (like many hotels) of stay 3 nights and get 4th night free is false and misleading.  For a four night period, it amounts to approx. $100 savings which is far less than a night free (approx. $350/night).  Hope you don't need  reservation assistance because their online chat doesn't work and their online call back doesn't work.  It's been 3 days and still no call back.  I called property directly, and in house reservation manager said  that although he recognized the issue I was raising, there was nothing he could do to fix it.  Beware of hotels that falsely advertise deals that don't exist.",1
4535,"A comfortable and clean hotel in Charlottenburg, conveniently located for restaurants and shopping ( a short walk from the Kurfürstendamm). Only 15 min by taxi from Tegel airport. S and U bahn close by. We chose this hotel for a weekend opera break as it is close to the Schiller Theater, currently housing the Staatsoper. Service was friendly and breakfast was great. An excellent choice for a holiday in Berlin. Only tiny minus was the noise from the street (we had a first floor room facing the street).",4
4536,"I'm not certain why so many rate this hotel so high.  It's okay, but really nothing special.  The rooms are clean, but often musty (due to the climate, I'm sure), and there are very few rooms with views of the ocean.  The breakfast is okay, but repetitive.  Also, the hotel does not use mineral water to make ice cubes and makes its juices from concentrate. ",2
4537,"Be warned that this is a boutique hotel in the worst neighborhood in San Francisco. Had to make my way through streets filled with homeless people and drug addicts to make my way to the hotel. Once in the hotel, the room is deceptively small and old. If youre looking for a good time or want to impress someone please stay somewhere else. The downtown Marriott is the same price but 100x nicer. This really should not be in the Marriott line of hotels.",1
4538,We stayed at Least Robinet d'or for one night.  We arrived early and our room was ready; fabulous.  The hotel is location is great. The hotel is located between Gare Du Nord and Gare de l’est near the Canal St Martin  The staff is awesome. The room was clean and spacious. The bed was comfortable with clean linen. The bathroom was clean with toiletries of good quality.  The food in the restaurant is good and affordable.  All in all I recommend this hotel and would stay again.,5
4539,"Small room, small bathroom, small bed..especially the shower room...i feel like living in cruise ship state room. If im not sleeping.. i cannot stay there for 30 minutes. For the cleanliness , they reuse the bedsheet for three days if you stay there for three days. I book and paid my room from 9 months before my arrival. But i cant check in until 4 pm. Either their housekeeping is slacking on their job or they didn't keep the room although it was paid , i dont know. But as a redemption for this problems , this hotel give me a very nice location, many restaurants and bars in the area. If you are going to amsterdam with your friends to have fun...stay here and you will be fine. But if you visit the city with your family...stay away from here. This hotel is not suited for it.",3
4540,"This hotel is a glorified cheap MOTEL. They get away with such low quality since the hotel is attached to a conference center. The hotel is devoid of quality restaurants, room service and fails to provide basic furniture and even a clock  in the room. This hotel should not receive any star rating. I was shocked to learn that this is a Hyatt regency hotel.",1
4541,"We were very excited about our stay at the Hotel Felix, having researched it online. It looked to be consistent with the boutique hotel explosion that's been occurring over the past ten years or so: interesting art, modern design, a sorta' ""hip"" bar, etc. Not unlike the hotel I work at myself. We got a fantastic rate via a 3rd party which, as a hotel employee, I understand the terms and conditions that accompany the agreement. I called and asked if there was any possibility of a complimentary upgrade that night but was told that it would be a $40 charge to upgrade from a Queen to a King. We decided not to since a Queen sized bed was perfectly fine.  Staff at check-in were friendly and proficient. It was when we arrived in our room, 1010, and saw that it looked to be something…",1
4542,"we had a lovely seaview room on the 15th floor and we loved it. The only down side is the receptionists. Their English is limited, which we didn't mind at all, but they really made no effort to communicate with us. There were 1 girl and 1 guy at the front desk while we were staying there, the girl is absolutely speechless whenever we ask a question. The guy, I believe his name is Martin or Matthew, has better English, but never looked at us in the eyes and kept avoiding answering and giving details to our questions.which we find pretty rude. For such a nice hotel with lovely facilities, they should train their staff better, despite the lack of language, they can at least show positive attitude when talking to guests, not showing that they're annoyed by questions",2

Calheta beach is a man made beach, but you have to pay to go onto the beach for the day. I found with this hotel it’s great to relax, but that’s about it, it’s not for the young, and it’s certainly isn’t for the clientele who wants something active. The food is very limited...the selection is very poor, and on some nights very random, but you can always find something to eat. The deserts are amazing, they do pride themselves on that. The premium upgrade isn’t worth the money, so don’t bother. The hotel does offer a private coach to Funchal city (1 hour trip) for 20 euros each...great service. This does leave on 2 different days, one comes back earlier…",3

The staff is attentive but the poor quality of the Afternoon Tea was disappointing.    The small selection of teas consisted of just a few regular teabags you would find in a grocery store  --  not any high-quality teas from the various well-known tea-regions in China, which are normally what you find at top-level hotels or traditional tea-houses.  The food was even worse:  Amongst the savoury items, the salmon/creamcheese roll was frozen and not yet thawed.  Amongst the sweet items, the macarons were hard and stale, and the other pastries were not fresh.    Overall, the tasteless and mediocre desserts were of a level more-expected from a…",2

4549,Let’s begin by saying that I’m a very laid back guy. I usually don’t complain much. It takes something pretty significant.  I've never written a hotel review. This isn't a good one.  I stayed at the Intercontinental hotel in San Francisco on the night of 5/23.  For $530 I assumed that I would be getting a beautiful clean hotel room.   The check-in was seamless and the person who checked me in was kind and welcoming. I was happy to be here.  I walked in the room and checked out the bathroom. The lights look like they haven't been cleaned in a few months (see photos). Lovely. Great view of the city though.  I slept well.  Next morning is when things go downhill.  I came back from breakfast and the ceiling began leaking urine (or some fluid that bubbles) all over the workspace…,1
4550,"Room really dated (especially the bathroom). Noisy if on the street side and in our case because of the airconditioning that we could not turn off. We only slept because we were really tired after our flight from Europe.  On the plus side: excellent location for city center and puerto madero,  both within 10 mins walk. Breakfast choices ample with different types of bread, cheese/ham ,cereal, fruit and pastries. And really nice staff that gave us a room at 9 am after our night flight.  All in all ok for basic tourist needs,  but I think there are nicer choices out there. Will stay in Recoleta area upon return to BA. ",2

She had to have manager approval (showed her pics of roaches) at 3:10ish PM no response Went to front desk again this time I spoke with manager and he didn’t wanna let me change rooms.

4556,This hotel was great for a short break in Berlin. Close to the underground train station to get around Berlin and to and from the airport.  The apartments have all amenities which is handy and at a decent price. The only thing is you have to pay for wifi but it's only €1 for the length of your stay per device.  ,4

Arriving at the hotel and long line for check in. Finally got my room, decent size and shape. Bathroom as experience in most hotels in Argentina in poor condition. Wifi works ok and stable. Bit noisy, can hear neighbors. Breakfast is a big disappointment. Most of food is out and takes forever to refill. Waited endless for coffee. At reception staff was unfriendly and for such a hotel with poor English. Luckily I did not have to pay myself. Location is good, right in center. Hop on/off bus close by as well as a pedestrian zone with many shops. Overall not very impress with NH Hotels during this trip.",2

And receptionist was very nice and kind. Gave us info, like usually you expect. Sadest part was in the evening, when I went to see friend on my own and went to hotel to pick up some stuff and join my girlfriend in old town.

Sadly we were let down . . . first and foremost let me just say this Four should have a warning on the website: Kids Tolerated. Pool is for 16 and older, lap swimming only.

The maids are not considerate either, if they are working then you ain't sleeping. No tea/coffee facilities in the room which I find ridiculous. The rooms are tired and disgusting shower/bath. One positive, just one, is the bed is comfortable. I stay in hotels all over the world and I am slowly going off the Sheraton ones. I would rather stay in a premier inn than this particular one. Book somewhere else.  ",2

We had booked through a company and paid quite a lot.   He later apologised but the damage was done.

Its entrance is very huge, but makes you feel as you were in a train or a bus station. Lifts don't smell good. Carpet on floors are old fashioned.

Best part of all - no room service ($700/night hotel in a '5 star property' and NO room service).  To compensate for no room service you have to go to the lobby restaurant, order and take it back to your room.

Also, it is really close to the Antibes so would recommend a day trip or 1!   As for this gem of a hotel - I definitely recommend staying here!   1. The hotel is infamous for its wealth and celebrity guests - and this makes your stay extra special.  2. It’s location is perfect - just across from the beach in the main part of town. Although you do have to pay to use the daybeds on the beach which is a little much given the rates for the hotel.   3. The buffet breakfast and drinks on the balcony are 👍👍👍  Only comment is that rooms, whilst large, are classic. Don’t expect modern! Otherwise - what a stay!      ",5

I immediately went down to the front desk to see if they could dry clean them. The managaer, Rudy Roman, took the shorts and was inspecting them while doubting our story. He said he was going to inspect the iron and see what happened. When we came back to check with him he stated that it couldn't have been the iron that did this, insinuating we were lying.

Also the cooperation with the Beach Club (Le Goéland – 10 minutes walking distance) is great, as the staff (Hugo!), location, service and food there is super nice too.

Paid good money to be here, coming from OH, for celebratory trip.  Asked to change rooms twice, once on the phone and they stated they were full and unable to accommodate anything until the following day.  My husband went to the reception desk requesting a room change and they stated there was absolutely nothing they could do and offered breakfast vouchers.  Horrible view, room seems nice but definitely not worth what we paid for 5 nights at the 7th ranked hotel in Miami Beach.  Extremely disappointed is an understatement.",1

Every Time we asked for a small help, the workers   smiled and nodded, but in the end- weren't able / didn't do much extra to help. I guess that what bothered me the most. I like feeling there's someone who would do their best to help you when needed. Everything else was ok. ",3

We were supposed to get picked up from the airport by a driver with a sign... who was 20 minutes late and we still got charged the full 30 euros. When we got to the hotel, the lobby was full of flies that never seemed to leave the whole time we stayed. It was gross and gave an immediate negative impression even though the lobby was nice otherwise. The housekeeping staff was also not very hospitable when we asked for a few extra things, so I felt uncomfortable every time we interacted with them.   That said, the breakfast spread is fantastic (especially the Greek French toast!) and the room itself was fine: clean and a good size, although pretty cold and not well insulated from outside sounds.

The room did not have a fridge, bathroom basin took forever to drain and room was in severe need of total makeover, including replacement of cigarette burnt table. A really good vacuuming would of been nice - felt like I had to leave my shoes on in the room all the time. No staff speak English at all and a fellow traveller was unable to source milk for his room at night as no one could understand hand gestures let alone English. Another couple moved rooms due to black mould on ceiling if their room. Breakfast is tailored toward Japanese tourists. For basic Western needs, done cereal is available, toast, jam and a fried egg. Would not recommend this joint to fellow travellers.",2

We booked 2 rooms.  That's not a well spent 88,000 points!   Spend your $ and your points somewhere else.    We stayed here a few months ago and thought it was a good property.  But not this trip.

If you are looking for a traditional hotel with bar, restaurant, etc., this is not for you.  If you are looking for larger accommodations for a group, then this is great!  Our apartment had 3 bedrooms, 2 baths (one is a half-bath) and a small, fully equipped kitchen. It was very, very  clean, nicely decorated and appropriately furnished.

From the very start of the holiday we noticed a clear divide between ourselves and all inclusive guests. We actually overheard a receptionist calling an all inclusive guest ""special"". I have noticed on this forum that any negative comments are brushed over by hotel management staff, and there are very few visible hotel management staff around the hotel to speak to. Other negatives are a flat atmosphere, especially around the pool.  Positives are lovely location, nice room, great views. But we won't return, we realise we are in the minority, but each to their own!",3

The hotel bar is one of the best in the area and is well frequented.  Only gripe was that the Executive lounge is on the ground floor which is very unusual.  The selection in the lounge is very good and the service was excellent. A very nice hotel, about 15 minute walk to the centre of town and right next to the Tiergarten, so great for walks and cyclists. We enjoyed our stay very much and recommend the hotel. ",4

The special notice in the rooms to practice safe sex and that free condoms are available at the front-desk I guess indicates the hotel is frequently visited by the prostitutes from the Copacabana.

4639,"Very clean hotel, quick 5 min walk to subway in a core location - couple stops from all the main attractions. Front desk staff was friendly (some of them) but not very helpful.  They didn't have information that I would expect front desk staff to have.  They didn't know or have recommendations of anywhere to eat nearby, they didn't know basic info for main attractions (i.e. how to get to places by subway).  We had to keep asking questions because they didn't take initiative to provide us with any information.  One upsetting thing was when I asked for some tap water, they said I had to pay for bottled water and that they couldn't give me tap water.  Kind of whack if you ask me.  Also, the pool in the winter season is only open until 6pm - it would be nice if it was a bit later…",3
4640,"I didn't have a bad time but I wouldn't stay again. The staff are nice, the facilities clean, the location central (perhaps too much so) and the breakfast useful. But very much a hostel if you're purpose is to  smoke so the atmosphere isn't great. ",3

In addition, they refused to issue an invoice in the name of my company, only to me personally, although my check-out had not been completed yet",2
4643,"We stayed here on a short business trip and couldn't have picked a better hotel. Location is very good, only a few minutes away from the shopping and the beach, the train station and the road in and out of Cannes (if you are driving). The hotel is very very clean, the bathrooms are brand new and bedding soft and comfortable. An underground car park was close and safe to park the car, if street parking outside the hotel wasnt available. The owner was very helpful, suggested great restaurants, trips along the French Riviera and just general Cannes know-how. Breakfast was continental, good value for money with a lovely selection of jams and honey. The hotel has a cute outdoor lounge area in the front, a nice place to chill either before or after going out for a meal - felt like…",5

The window did not open and the carpeted floor definitely needs updating. If you are looking for a place to sleep, it is ok. I still preferred to stay in an AirBnb over this hotel.   The service at the front desk was excellent and the staff were all very friendly. It is also close to the Alfama district which is one of the best spots to tour around in the city. If you stay, there is a excellent breakfast/brunch place about a ten minutes walk away called Brick Café that I highly recommend.",3
4647,"What can I say about this hotel, nothing good. Let's start from the food, they serve frozen hamburger ummm, I complained but no one even came to me to appologize or suggest replacement, the pool is in the buiding outside the hotel, so I passed the street to go to the pool and I was even more surprized that in order to go to jacuzzi I have to go back to the hotel. The jacuzzi was so small, size of home bath and with extriemly hot water so I couldn't even use it. It's not a service you expect to receive. Stay away, there are many much better hotels at the same price.",2

4649,"Booked hotel due to cost and location. The location was fantastic and the staff were very kind and helpful. Our room was at the back which I was pleased about due to trip advisor reviews saying front rooms had traffic noise.   Room was very pleasant although very warm and we couldn’t get the air conditioning to work (saying that, we didn’t go and ask reception for help). It was also definitely not soundproof. You could hear people in the corridors and a toilet flushing - initially we thought this was our toilet flushing on its own, but must have been next door.   Other than the above issues, we had a fantastic two night stay and appreciated being so close to the Gothic Quarter.",4

4652,"I was really disappointed by this place. I always tried to be even in my review but it was hard to enjoy this stay. After some trouble with check in (kayak had made a mistake and double booked us, but Loi really had no sympathy and would not put us in a room and let us resolve it after refreshing ourselves, despite us being exhausted, which was not an unreasonable request since the room was already paid for - twice!) we decided to put this behind us and were determined to enjoy our stay.  Now first, on the good side, the place itself is just beautiful. Nestled in the jungle, the poolside area is exotic and the rooms are modern and very tasteful.  This revived us a bit.  However, upon trying to order anything....we soon found the awful service permeates this entire place! Good…",2

They told me that the certificate was valid and could make the reservation for me. I agreed.  Check in was great but 10 min later they called me and said that they had to charge me for the room! The excuse was"" you needed to call the hotel direct to redeem""  My guest was about to arrive so I agreed under protest. After the stay, I tried to contact the supervisor and the general manager about this but no one has returned my email or my calls. I requested that my money be refunded.  I have also contacted Starwood corporate directly.  Please be very careful about booking at this hotel. You may be sorry!  ",1
4654,"This was one of a number of Radisson Blu hotels we stayed in during our Baltic Countries visit.  Others were at the usual above-average level but this one was poor.  Firstly, the hotel is in a reasonably good position and has a Skyline Bar on the 26th floor.  You can see everywhere in and around Riga.  The Bar has a Happy Hour and the prices are low by western standards - so this is a plus.  The minuses start in the rooms, which were clearly designed by someone who never stayed in them.  No drawers and a single shelf to store clothes (we stayed 3 days so needed to unpack).  Then there was no plug in the washbasin so shaving had to be done in running water (not very eco..) - the desk manager told me this was standard across Europe, implying I was stupid, despite there being a…",2

This hotel is located near a train station and a busy subway and so I thought it would be an ideal place for me - Plus the name ""Holiday Inn Express""  seemed to fit well because I had good experiences with same hotel here in the states.   During my 3rd day visiting, I was walking down the busy sidewalk before 8 PM near the hotel to get something to eat.  I was told in English I can get a good massage in the area too, but instead I tricked, trapped and lured into another location with a small room -  Inside there were 5 mobsters who began bouncing my around in the room for awhile.  In short, they…",2

However, it was unbelievably expensive for what was offered, you have to eat their $14 each meal which we found in the most part inedible. We emailed ahead explaining a seafood allergy, and after acknowledgement found fish in almost every dish, which they denied. We left after 3 days extremely hungry. As an isolated island, it seems obvious that they would have some kind of internal shop selling snacks/toiletries etc but this is non existent. Extremely impractical. Also, not quite sure what made it an ecolodge, the resort offers 3 trails to follow to check out the plastic and overwhelming…",2

They still charged me without wanting to at all help me out. That, right there, is a reason to never go there.   Awful way of dealing with it - awful hospitality. I understand policies, but damn I was sick. Taking my money elsewhere. Went to Hilton Conrad a day later then The Gwen the week after and never looked back. ",1
4659,"The room was smaller but had great amenities for those who prefer not to dine out every day. There was a stove top, microwave and sink which enabled us to prepare meals right there and dine on the balcony.

The only complaint was their policy of keeping passports overnite at the front desk but after several attempts they agreed to return ours.",3

As a Small and Luxury Hotels member, I requested for room upgrade ( it depended on room availability.)  The lady at the reception asked me if I would like to take a look at the first room. It was nice and spacious but I told her that I would prefer if I could get the better one. About 10 minutes later, she came back with a smile and leaded us to a new suite with 2 bathrooms. The first one with a big rain shower and another one was adjacent to the bedroom. The jacuzzi was located in the second bathroom. After having dinner we returned back and took a bath. It was a chill night in April about 10 degree outside. There was a problem with the heater, it could not be turned…",3

They also have paid lockers, no other way to keep your stuff there for a few extra hours without paying extra. Otherwise it's fairly clean, organized, professional and trustable. Doesn't create a cozy atmosphere though, I personally prefer places which feel a bit more casual and friendly. I was told to wait 40 minutes to check in my room, but I tried to go in anyways to check and the key cards worked and the whole room was already cleaned out so I just checked in anyways. With a tiny bit of extra effort, they could make it a bit more convenient for the guests.Location is great! ",3

Our stay was good but was a bit spoiled by a few let downs along the way.  First we need to say that the hotel upgraded us to a junior suite from the double room that we had booked and paid for. It was a very welcome present and gave us access to a bigger room and a private jacuzzi on our balcony.  The views are literally breathtaking and the weather was amazing. We didn't get tired of looking from our balcony.  The few let down are as follows: the food and drinks served in the hotel as well as the breakfast are really average.  We ordered two mojitos on arrival: no ice (!!), no flavour apart from a lot of mint, no lime of very little served in a tall and…",3

The first thing we noticed were the large groups of school students everywhere. It was a bit daunting walking off a train into a hotel swarming with large groups.   The room itself was ok but definitely not hotel standard. The bunk beds were comfortable but our double (which was 2 singles pushed together) bed was so uncomfortable, so much so that you could feel the springs in the mattress.   Pros were that the place was spotlessly clean and that included our room. The room itself was spacious and bright but just lacked comfort.   Staff were pleasant enough but not overly friendly at…",3

This is a great neighborhood to stay in - it's close to lots of restaurants, shopping, and sights. That being said, the rest of the experience was mediocre. The rooms are unusually dark and not cheerful at all. Although the hotel is relatively new, a large shag rug in our room looked dated and dirty. We booked an executive room, which is the largest, and it was laid out strange with much wasted space. The bathroom is small and dark and so poorly planned that the sink gets soaked each time you turn on the faucet. There is a coffee maker, which we did really appreciate. The lobby is small and not…",3

The main problem is shower in the room, because it is not comfortable for two persons.",4
4679,After entering the beautiful lobby of this historic hotel I was excited to be spending four nights here. When I entered the elevator I felt that I was in the twilight zone. It was small and in poor condition. Exiting the elevator into the lobby the carpet was dirty and dingy. The lighting was abysmal. Our room was off of the main corridor   -when we opened  the door we encountered all white walls with three small photographs. Two of cows and a tiny one on the main wall that upon close inspection was a saxophone player. The bathroom was equally white. Tiny square awkward sink. After one night in this hospital looking room we checked out and went to the lovely and colorful indigo hotel around the corner. Difference was night and day!! ,1

With the bathroom door open, you can even get to the entrance to the room because there is a big ""closet"" (with kettle, safe, etc. in it) right opposition to the bathroom, forming a pinch point. Small bathroom, small desk. Having said all that, it is fairly clean and nice, breakfast is nice too although the selection of food is average.",3

The room, which was a sea view again was spotless but lacked tea and coffee making facilities.  The location was on the sea front and only a short walk to the amenities in the town. We were booked bed and breakfast and breakfast can only be described as average with no option for freshly cooked food just continental or a choice of five warmed foods. The hotels location, cleanliness and pool area are its positives.  While the breakfast wasn't the best there was also a high level of general noise from adjacent rooms and floors.  Alarmingly the window of our 9th floor room could be fully opened.",3

When we mentioned we were valet parking, she said ""Yes, that 20$ is for the valet and the cards on file for incidentals."" We both remarked, TO HER, how great a deal the valet parking was at 20$ a night and she simply smiled and finished checking us in.

Our room was spotlessly clean - simply furnished (we loved the wardrobe which was a massively oversized dolls house), but very comfortable. Breakfast was simple but excellent quality.  The staff were universally welcoming and helpful. Excellent value for money. We'd happily return for a longer stay.",5

The hotel is OK, I guess, but certainly not worth $278 a night! This included a breakfast but we had to leave long before they started serving! Parking was extra.

Where the hotel fails on numerous fronts was in the service aspect- contrary to many comments here. On arrival to the hotel I was taken to my room and needed to change for the conference.

The location and ease of access to buses and metro was fantastic. We covered huge amounts of Barcelona in the six days were there. Sadly a four star hotel should do better with some basics.

As soon as we arrived and was warmly greeted by the owners we knew this was going to be a wonderful break. We arrived on Sunday 11th June for 3 nights B&B. The rooms are spacious and light, in typical French décor. There is also a Roof terrace with sun loungers and easy chairs, we sat out in the evenings with a glass of Red Wine watching the sunset and generally feeling relaxed.

The manager, reception staff and breakfast staff were all very friendly and went out of their way to ensure we had the most comfortable stay possible.  The breakfast is a selection of pastries, ham and cheeses, cereal, and yogurt as well as hot and cold drinks. The metro is on the same street (1 minute walk) and anywhere in Paris is accessible from here direct or with a change to another line.  The hotel is in a great location as there are many shops and restaurants and an ATM directly below.  A very nice stay made even better by the staff, THANKYOU, we will…",5

4706,"The room was clean and spacious. We stayed in this hotel for two nights. There is an open concept large pool on the roof of the building but the water was relatively cold.  The hotel is well located to downtown but not centrally located. To reach downtown you can either take a taxi or use the Metro. The closest metro station, ‘Jardim Zoologic’ is about a 10 minutes walk from the hotel. Downtown is about 6 stations away.  The a/c in the room works well; however, if you turn the fan to level 2 or 3 there is an annoying continuous noise. Tuning the fan to level 1 will make the noise disappear but you will hear the sound of the cars from the road. The alternative if you do not want to hear either noises is to keep the tv on. Speaking about the TV, there is a wide selection of movie…",3
4707,This is by far the worst hotel i've ever stayed in. The rooms are nothing like what the websites make out to be. There were RATS in the room!!!! not just one but a whole family of rats! I spotted two! and in the middle of the night you can hear a whole family rats running behind the walls! The shower did not work! The shower head was broken and all that was coming out was a jet of water. When i first opened the tap the water was rusty brown. The furniture was old and everything was just of inferior condition. The room was right next to the bar and you can hear loud music playing throughout the night. I absolutely hated my stay there!,1
4708,"July 2015, spent three nights at this hotel. Very clean, nice room, good location, friendly stuff, good meal.  Highly recommended!  Near the hotel are some nice places to eat.

When I first arrived at this hotel just over a week ago, I was ""high"" on being fresh off the banana boat in Chicago and the lobby is the best maintained space in the hotel (as far as I could tell). Once I checked in, I made my way up the dank/smelly stairwell to my room, which was just above the lobby. Now in the room (and happy to be in a room with a bed given that mine hadn't arrive yet) and overlooking the dirty windows/screens, dim/outdating lighting, and generally rundown appearance and musty smell, I was still thinking ""it's just got character: 3 stars.""  In a nutshell? WRONG.  The carpeting is dirty enough to leave dirt imprints on my feet and socks. The sheets/pillowcases were stained. The wallpaper is peeling in multiple places, the…",1

We booked a suite which overlooks the main square of Porto and while its very noisy with traffic, ambulance and construction we can hear in our room through the closed windows, it is quieter of a night. The restaurant is Nuevo cuisine and not a large menu, however what we ate was nice. The bar has a great setting with a library style. What lets this hotel down is the service in all areas, apart from breakfast, it is dreadful yet they seem to have plenty of staff.

BUT: room was kind of shabby, room phone did not work, nor did the heater in the bathroom. Even AC did not function well. I don't understand how this can be rated a 5 star hotel. It's not a bad hotel. It's fine. it just should not be rated 5 star",3
4717,Stayed at the hotel 26th October - 2nd November 2018.  In general the hotel was good - a lovely reception and lounge area - super indoor spa pool - nice restaurant (we went half board and the meals surprisingly good for buffet style). The staff were friendly and accommodating.  Our bedroom (room 51) was comfortable if not a little dated - and despite being warned about noise from a nearby building site and asking for a quiet room prior to travelling - we were placed in a room right next to the site! Fortunately we spent most of the daytime away from the hotel so made no fuss.  The biggest surprise for a 4 star hotel came at the bar where they completely ran out of all brands of blended whiskies - from Monday - Thursday (for 4 days running). They also ran out of certain wines in…,3
4718,"Just ended a three night stay at the Sheraton Mendoza and am so glad it's over.  The rooms are old and poorly designed (especially the shower) and in desperate need of maintenance (think torn wallpaper, sewer stench coming out of the toilet requiring a bodega air freshener run, etc.)  Of particular note is the fact that we got to experience three different rooms due to non-functioning air conditioning.  Also, the lobby and most/all common areas stink from cigarette smoke.  The only bright spot was the front desk staff (especially Hiram) who went above and beyond to assist us in our quest not to die of heatstroke and tried to make all the inconvenience up to us.  If you're headed to Mendoza, spend a bit more and stay at the Diplomatic or the Park Hyatt (although its lobby smells…",2
4719,"Clean, beautiful, quiet. What else would you want from your hotel. The staff was really helpful and kind. Our room was quite small, but enough for two people for one night stay. Couldn't hear a peep from neighbouring rooms. Really nice breakfast! One of the best hotels I've ever been.",5
4720,"Fantastic location - heaps of eateries and grocery shops and very handy for the metro. The terrace was actually on the roof of a different building (6 flights of stairs with no lift) but we got over that pretty quickly. Our apartment had a small balcony (for outdoor smoking) and the lounge room picture window was always filled with THAT church - amazing!!! The apartment was very clean and well equipped, and the beds were comfortable. ",4
4721,We stayed here as a family of 4 we had  two rooms. Which were right next door. For a city location the rooms were super quiet and the beds very comfortable. Dark shades for night time were a nice touch. Also coffee/tea maker in room. Lounge area had waters and cookies. Free bottle of water daily in your room. Small luxury hotel and we thought the price was very good. Next door is a nice coffee shop so we did not go for the breakfast which was discounted to 10.00 per day when we were there.So you might want to wait and decide on breakfast when you arrive. Location was great. Nice shopping area with high end stores. Lots of good restaurants within walking distance. La Sagrada Familia is within walking distance and not to be missed. I suggest doing a tour guided tour. Walk to the…,4

You cannot beat the location, in Monmartre, not on a high-traffic street, short walk to everything including Sacre Coeur, awesome sidewalk cafes, shops, Dali Museum, metro stop, and more.   The staff are very helpful and friendly.  The rooms are very nice with pretty views.  Have stayed here twice and will for sure stay again. ",5

My husband and I booked one of the smallest rooms, (103) which YES, it was basically a bed and attached bathroom the size of a closet, but we had no problems. (We also had two large suitcases, so yes, it can be done!) The bed was comfortable and the room clean and quiet. We were greeted with a happy 'bonjour' by any staff we encountered during our 3-night stay. When we booked an hour in the spa, it was gorgeous and sexy, and perfect for recovering our tired feet after a long day of walking the city. The location is fabulous too--only a five-minute walk to the Louve.   For us, this was worth every penny!",5
4725,"I will start with the bad things... Didnt like my room had heating off and didnt like the shower with curtains since all the floor gets wet... And shouldnt like to wait so longer for the breakfast but the reality is that was compensated with the quality of it and the simpathy of the entire staff.  A lot of comfusion with orders and billing but i understand it since most of staff was very young and seem like bew there. I recommend this hotel since its well located, the design its very interesting and all staff extremelly friendly, but if dont have patience for mistakes, if you are one of those too serious and boring persons, dont stay here!",4

The free flow of champagne was not included anymore and the cheapest bottle is 1000 rmb, pretty expensive even for Shanghai. 2. The food buffet was very poor compared to what it used to be. Sashimi choice was limited and there was not red tuna, only white one. Only rolls available not sushi at all. 3. Service not at the level expected for the price you pay (345 rmb plus 16% tax). You need to call the waiter to ask for water or to clean the table.  It is not worth the price you pay. I will not go anymore.",2
4730,The staff try their hardest but this is definitely not a five star resort.  To be fair the facilities are great it's just a shame the service does not match. Staff are very polite and try their best but it becomes very obvious very quickly this hotel is not well managed. The bar shuts at 945 which isn't great if you want a little night cap and the food is inconsistent depending on who is cooking it. One day I ordered a chicken burger which was amazing the next day it looked like slop.  In the room the hot water does not work properly which means you can't make use of the bath. The internet connection is bad. In regards to the general manager we asked to see him twice and he could not be bothered with us. When requesting to meet with him the first time we were told he was in a…,2

The kitchens are a little under-supplied, and the appliances are somewhat hard to use, but otherwise fine.  The rooftop pool was loved by the kids, and the location on Passeig de Gracia was fantastic.  The only drawback was that even the family apartments only sleep 4 people, so we had to get an additional room because we were one kid over.",4

The last day I was leaving at half 6 on a coach that would take 3 hours to get to the airport, the gentleman at reception asked when I checked out if I had breakfast I had said no as I didn’t realise it was open but I would walk around.

Sad because I had high hopes from the pictures/reviews online, and sad because we were celebrating a special occasion (my fiancé's 30th). Communication before our arrival was brilliant (thank you Priscila), and indeed the staff were all excellent throughout our stay (at reception, cleaners, and in the bar). Nothing is too much trouble, whether it be tips on places to visit, or help making bookings. We were quite disappointed in our room (104). It was supposedly a 'deluxe', but was, in my opinion, a fairly standard size. It looked quite tired and dated; it did not have the updated bathroom design shown in the promo pictures, there was an old kitchenette hidden behind a curtain, the laminate flooring was…",3

4737,We stayed in the old house which is well decorated and comfortable.   It has the pool outside which is helpful and fun.  They do a nice lunch service at the old house which is alongside the old wall. The problem is breakfast.  It takes forever to order and arrive and there is about 80% chance your order will be wrong.  Even on holiday this is frustrating so that on our two day stay we only did this once - the second day we went out.  The sad part is that we complained and the manger said they knew their service was terrible but 'people liked a la carte breakfast'  No they do not.  Have a buffet so people can get what they want within a reasonable time.,3
4738,"The only thing this place has going for it is a cool lobby atrium and its location.  On a recent business trip, we had 3 room at the hotel, one smelled weird, the other had a ripped up carpet, and mine had ripped curtains.  Not only are the rooms dated, but the staff does little to help.  At the pool, we asked for robes to get back to the room, and were told that you had to request them in the room, not at the pool.  There were a stack of robes on the counter where we requested one, and we were told that we couldn't use those since we didn't request on in the room.  The lack of customer service, dated rooms and the smug attitude by the staff make it hard to justify the price for this dated hotel.  ",2

He eventually assured us that the manager could straighten things out in the morning. Next morning we find out that the manager wouldn't be coming in at all and a ""lead"" would be handling it.

Television has distorted picture and when I complained was told ""well that's just how cable is"". Not a pleasant stay, don't let the pictures online fool you.

There was a desk, a fridge, a nice window overlooking Paris and it was just across the street from the Eastern Train station in a fairly nice neighborhood.  I was able to walk to nearly all the attractions that I wanted to see, all except the Eifel Tower which I needed to take the Metro to.  The Metro stop is just outside the hotel.

I was very surprised not to be offered a welcome drink at reception which was the norm in the Pestana Casino where I stayed previously. It soon became clear they do not offer drinks at all in this hotel. It is the first 5 star where you are not even offered water with your evening meal any drinks you want you must pay for so disappointing. The staff just do the basics no extra mile do there job and that's that. I found this hotel too large it's a maze of corridors I never found the spa yet. Don't think I will return to this hotel.

Indeed, we (about 200 of us) were its very first guests so, as you can imagine, there were a few snagging issues.To give the hotel its due it dealt with issues quickly and effectively which included sewage piping becoming blocked on one of the upper floors. There was still a fair amount of cosmetic work being done in readying meeting rooms and other parts of the hotel (including its garage) for its official opening on 1st September.

The entry next to a car park was a bit weird but the rooms were well kept, the kitchenette was clean and we liked the quiet neighborhood.  We also stayed a more touristy hotel near the Rambla which was loud and not as nice comparatively.   The only downside was there was no hot water on the second day— not sure if that was an anomaly or an issue they need to resolve.

The local restaurant “bo ne” next to the hotel is really good and gives a nice local atmosphere.…",2
4764,"Of course a great location. Mega-styled furniture in the public areas such as lounge, bar and restaurant. Berlin is a cosmopolitan city - and it works. Very positive: I even got around 11 p.m. a table in the trendy Grace Restaurant. My room was very quiet although forward to Kurfürstendamm. Not very big .... but with everything, which can garantee a beautify a stay in Berlin. And the shower had a tight beam ... very positive! Often you find that quite different. Unfortunately I have to stop now with the positive. On the second day (a very busy business day) I went to my room at 2 p.m ... it was not ready yet. If I had the sign ""Please make room"" hung out in the morning. Hmmm. I asked at the reception if that was normal. Of course not. They were visibly embarrassed. The room was…",4
4765,We paid about $350 a night for 3 nights which from what I viewed previously was a decent rate for an upgraded king room. They gave us the worst room available as I’m sure they were trying to reserve the better rooms for online sales. We asked for a better room after viewing the assigned room and were given a room that was smaller and on the street. We told them that we would keep our original room as we thought it would be more quiet.  Even though our room was ADA compliant so it had no shower door and the water went everywhere when we showered.  We made it clear we would accept the extremely inadequate room to avoid the street noise of the second room offered they failed to mentioned that the original room assigned to us was immediately across from a nightclub. The noise…,1
4766,My husband and I stayed at this hotel when we visited Paris 8-11th March. It was perfect for what we wanted- somewhere to relax inbetween sightseeing. There is a small restaurant/bar - we had a drink one evening which was pleasant however can't comment on the food. The room was clean and the shower brilliant. The walls were quite thin (2 American girls having a full on argument in the room above us did spoil the tranquillity one morning!) Bed was comfortable and the staff friendly. They held our bags for us on our last day as checkout is as 12 whereas our train wasn't until 8pm which was a good of them. We would definitely stay again. ,5
4767,"Clean and well situated hotel which is within walking distance of loads of restaurants and bars and there is a bus stop a very short distance from the hotel so conveniently placed.    Rooms are clean and we had a lovely balcony with a great view of the sea so no complaints there.    We could only get wi-fi if we were downstairs in reception or by the pool so not sure if we were just unlucky.   Breakfast was fine but lacked variety. However, it was hot and was enough to get you going for the day.    Biggest issue would be the staff which seems to be a running theme here.  Past experience of Madeira had been that people were friendly and helpful but it seems Raga missed the boat when they recruited staff.  Pool staff were just ignorant and unhelpful, reception made you feel like…",3

I was happy with the prompt response from the reservations team so I went ahead and booked through Le Club Accor.   We were very excited as the location was perfect but the service was poor.   Let me start with the check in process. Check in was sooo slow. When we arrived at the main hotel to get the key, they just gave us the key and told us to go to a certain building. We have 1 big luggage, 1 small one and a duffel bag. It took us 10 minutes to locate the area as NOBODY assisted us, while we saw the other guests who checked in and were assisted to the building by a bellman.

When you've paid for a huge room with high ceilings though you expect a few other creature comforts. The shower was excellent. They were helpful about changing currency and the location was ok.The cost of the minibar (water $8 for 750ml - the tap is free and safe) and the laundry ($10 for a pair of jeans) were so outrageous that I really felt this place was putting itself far far above its station.  *on arrival 3 hours before check-in informed the room wasn't ready.

I came from across the country & was so exhausted as I had been flying all day. I came for a business conference & wanted to get my peaceful rest. Great location next to Moscone. The young man at reception said we needed to call the booking agency and he handed phone over front desk which I found so humiliating & embarrassing. Really? Are you guys 4 star?

I gave them two stars because at least weather and resort itself are very pleasant.",2

I decided to call the front desk and then realized the phone did not work, so I didn't complain. The worst part was that when in the middle of the night, I heard very loud noises from right outside my window (turns out there is a loading dock) so the loud banging continued all night, I was unable to sleep and it was a miserable night.

If we visit Berlin again, I would book here straight away!",5
4780,Adjacent lounge hosts parties at night and plays loud music past midnight.  We called the front desk but they could do little.  We heard the bass constantly and just couldn't sleep.  Bathroom is full of molds and it does not look sanitary at all.  This motel is close to a hospital and sirens are clearly audible in the room.  Funny when we checked in they made us sign a waiver that we would be fined for $100 if someone complained about noise from our room after 11 p.m.  There are cleaner and quieter hotels for the money.,1

We arrived and provided payment at 2:40p and were told our room was not ready, so we had a drink in the lobby and waited for the call or text.  At 3:30p my husband inquired and was told our room was not ready still.  At 3:45p I was told that our room was not ready.

Being right in the middle of the old city with all its built in charm, interest and plethora of dining and entertainment options was fantastic. The 6 days we spent here were most enjoyable. We had been given advice that when looking for somewhere to eat you should just stand at the front door and pick any direction in which to walk. Sounded strange at the time but turned out to be spot on. Take a hard right turn around the corner and check the Callejon restaurant in particular. Of particular note were the very friendly, competent and helpful staff. This place proudly displays its industry awards at the front desk and deservres more.",4

It is an old hotel in the centre (+), with nice staff (+) an spacious rooms (+), however it also smells old in rooms (-) and despite claiming being all smoke free, you can feel the cigarette smoke in the room (!) and very clearly in the hotel corridor (-). I hoped for great breakfast, whih I read about and I found very poor selection of a three star hotel :(. ",2

Rooms were beautifully decorated, and cleaned very well over the course of our stay and on arrival.   I believe that the only thing to note is if you are travelling by foot to town with children, there is a large road roundabout to cross. While there is a pedestrian crossing, and cars often stopped I imagine that the crossing would be difficult to manage with young children and the cars are going very fast through that area.   Aside for that the hotel itself is well worth the stay! ",5

For example:  the hairdryer burned out with flames and smoke...they said that they would have maintenance fix it...I don't think so!  ...no replacement hairdryer was readily available...tried to go to another room to use the hairdryer there but no hairdryer.

Nothing to complain about, nothing to remember. It was a small lounge/bar area where it also was a television. Even if some of my friends were there alone watching a football match, they were hushed when clapping ofr a goal. So quite a practical hotel, not too far from the centre, but not as close as the name suggests. The employees probably think that paying guests is a hassle. Breakfast was ok.",3
4789,"A few positives about this property: nice and quiet ocean front, quiet pool, and a decent restaurant.   Besides that, I would not recommend this location. It appears that several of the ‘rooms’ are actually independently owned and the hotel has ‘no control’ over these rooms. I recently booked a room in the hotel tower but after seeing the tiny room and the non-private balcony, I asked if there was any other rooms available. They told me there was a room in the dolphin building which was steps from the pool and beach, but the room itself was an outdated, dirty, and bare bones version of what the online photos look like. I did take the upgrade, but with an added $40/night charge. For that rate, there are far better resorts on West Maui.   In addition, the front desk staff did not…",2

The hotel is placed on one side of a big road while the beach and beachclub is on the other side of same road. The rooms are very big but a bit outdated, especially the showers need a brushing up to meet the standards expected.  The spa area + training area is great and so is the staff working there. In general all the staff working in the hotel was really helpful, except upon check in.

I called the hotel for the next five days leaving voice messages that were never returned. Poor customer service.,1

Plus, you get a card with free drinks ( beer, soft drinks), and some snacks to claim during your stay. Walking distance to Historic Jewish Museum, and only slightly longer walk to Brandenburg Tor and Reichstag. Stadmitte is the closest U-Bahn station. Recommend for stay 👍",4

4794,We recently attended an event here.  We had over 12 people and probably spent over $2k total.  The staff had the nerve to kick out a person from our group because he lit a cigarette.  This was a day party.  There were about 20 other people that were also smoking.  No warning was given.  I can see if we were there just loitering but realize we are spending ridiculous amounts of money here.  Awful staff.  Had a great experience but the security staff think they are part of the swat team.  The guy was a total loser.,1

Also I met a friend down in Rio who was treated very poorly after merely escorting me up to my room one night (no overnight stay, no luggage). He was told he'd have to pay if he wanted to ""visit a guest upstairs"". I felt very offended and judged. Staff speaks limited English and air system is not the best. Small rooms. Pool isn't bad, but small in size and depending where you are facing, you could be looking at run-down buildings.

When I checked out I asked for the corrected receipt and was told that it appeared I didn't book the ""park for a Penny"" offer after all and they would not be able to take the parking off.  The manager was called and she said the exact same thing.  I believe that based on my knowledge of the offer alone it should have been clear that I was not trying to get out of anything.

When we asked for clarification on many of the terms of the contract, we were given unprofessional and condescending responses by the Catering Sales staff. We would strongly suggest anyone who is thinking about  such Wedding Block Agreement to think twice about signing one of these agreements. …",1
4821,"During our trip in South America, we stayed in a few boutique or 4 star hotels. Most of them were amazing in staff, room quality and service. This one failed in all 3 categories. Let me first say, staff wasn´t helpfull at all. We booked for 2 nights in advance, but because of bad weather conditions (there was a lot of snow in the surrounding mountains), we had to leave 1 night early to catch our plane home on time. I tried to explain that this wasn´t our fault, and that we wouldn´t get home otherwise. We had to pay the full 2 nights. That I could understand, but there was no sence of understanding what so ever. In check-out, we had to pay extra taxes that we were not informed about during ckeck in. Again, no understanding or excuses there. At night, it was freezing cold in the…",2
4822,The hotel is in an excellent position just a couple of blocks back from the wharf. There are lots of eating and drinking places nearby as well as cable car and tram stops.  Tourist buses are also within east reach.  I would certainly recommend a stay here ,1
4823,"Popped in to the spa area a couple of times recently.  The gym is quite small but adequate, small indoor pool and sauna. Pool has water jets too, staff will turn on if requested.  Pleasant for a short visit.    We normally visit around 5pm and annoyingly the shower gels and body lotions are often empty by then, why they don’t check them is beyond me.  You get given two towels - which are good quality, so that’s a plus.  The pool always used to be lovely and warm but these days it’s quite chilly, you wouldn’t want to just lounge around in it anymore..  Most of the staff are welcoming, although there is one youngster who rarely says a word as she hands you the towels and the locker key.  I’ve probably rated this as very good in the past but I think it’s dropped a bit recently... …",3

Reasonable rate for such a great location and nice hotel.",5

This is a historic hotel, and the lobby is grand and beautiful. If I could have stayed in the lobby, things would have been great, but I had to go to my room. I was first given room 531. I head off for the elevator to go up to my floor (beautiful old elevator), then I get off the floor and I feel like I stepped onto the set for a remake of Amityville Horror. Walls and carpet in total disrepair. The hallway was dimly lit and just creepy. I immediately wonder what I've gotten myself into. After going down this long dark hallway, I have to go through a rickety door to another dark hallway to get to my room. I enter, and I can honestly say I've…",1

I had no place to put my three pieces of luggage and walking in the room is only possible of you are walking sideways with your back against the wall. When showering, water didn’t drain well (2-3 inches), and was lukewarm at best. This is a 2-3 star no frills hotel.

The hotel is a comfortable 20min walk from Alexanderplatz station which was convenient for airport transfers (both TXL bus & trains to Schonefeld airport). Not close to main sights so a day train ticket is useful. ,4

Starting with Tina up at the front, who was soooo helpful and friendly, to the gentleman who ran the breakfast with his great big smile welcoming us each and every morning.  Not forgetting who ever cleans our room each day and can't forget the manager sharing his tissue with me.  I want to thank each of them for the kind words, friendly smiles and the willingness to take the extra steps to make our stay comfortable. A special thanks to Tina who went the extra mile to help us and answered our questions, help us with where to go and what to see.  Thank you Tina!",5

You must take a taxi/Uber to most areas of Porto.  Hotel on busy city street, far from charm of Porto.  There is nowhere close to hotel for a nice breakfast or coffee before airport, except hotel buffet in basement.  For a business trip, this would suffice.  Billing itself as a luxury spa hotel in Porto, is slightly misleading for people looking for a leisurely weekend.",3

We noticed the snorkels are not disinfected between use- merely dunked into a bucket of salt water.   Many more disappointments but we are here for another week ( having been forced to pre pay 100% in advance). We are huge travelers and to be honest we have never experienced these payment terms .... my goodness! And the prices were not all inclusive - all meals are extra .   I must also share the fire alarm Emergemcy last night. I don’t mind an alarm ... we all went downstairs @ 10pm as instructed by the PA. However when we went down there was NO ONE in control. No one explaining what was happening. No one ushering us to an open space. No one…,2

The manager, whom we asked to speak with, was extremely rude and inconsiderate.   Later, when we returned to our hotel, I noticed that the restaurant had credited my card twice. One was correct at 173 USD, but there was another one at 270 USD which we didn't recognise! This is where the real problems started. We called the restaurant multiple times trying to get a hold of the manager, left voicemails asking to be contacted but no one got back to us. At last we finally got in touch with a manager, Wes, he promised to investigate and get back to us. Two days later we still hadn't heard from him so we called the hotel asking for…",1

Breakfast selection was great and make sure you have ample time to enjoy it. Even though the hotel is right under the flight path,i dont quite hear the noise and slept very well. Reception area is very modern and a nice bar and restaurant to relax if you feel like going out to downtown. There is a gaming area with XBox as well for families",3

After changing rooms about 11PM when I asked for food and realized the table in the room does not support a tray with my request. Breakfast is a mess - there is no appropriate fork, knife and spoons for a breakfest meal + the noise in the restaurant is umbearable - waiters work like Vikings in a battle and I have no words about the crowd in there. In the last day thre were no enough spoons and wood palletes were given to substitute. To close all the mess, when doing my checkout took me ages because a newly implemented system that no one looks to understand how to operate. Complete nightmare!!! ",2

We chose the Fairmont because of location to Ghirardelli Square, Fisherman's Wharf, and the Golden Gate Bridge.  The location was perfect.  The hotel on the other hand was a different story.  The staff was awesome and brought us to our large room upon check in.  They brought us to our room and gave us a tour.  The room was very amazing and nicely decorated, however the room was poorly maintained.  There was mold around the ktichen sink, mold all over the shower floor, and around the bathtubs.  Yuck.

Requests to have it turned up ignored by reception. Rom windows are frosted! Presume to disguise view of roofs and air con. They claim prime ministers and presidents have stayed here. Really?,2

My room faced the main road which is very busy with loud cars and motorcycles most of the night.  The windows do a poor job of keeping the noise out.   In addition, the room walls are thin with little to no sound proofing--had to listen to screaming children most of the night.  Needless to say, a good night sleep is not possible here.  I think this is a very old facility not up to modern standards.

Apparently there was something wrong with the computer system, but no explanation, no apology. 2.  The room had no room service menu or any information on hotel services, like restaurant info, hours, etc.  Nothing.  3.  There were no electrical outlets anywhere close to the bed 4.

Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else!!!,1

The only downside is we booked through hostel world and they were dreadful!

Our first room had cobwebs covering the windows and it appeared that the bathroom hadn't been cleaned.   They finally managed to switch us into another room, however when we got there we found a bug in the bathroom, moths in the curtains, hair on the floor and a dried blood stain on the wall.

We had half board and due to having to leave early in the morning, we did not have breakfast.  We did have dinner and it was not all that great.

Trendy and modern yet slightly odd, I just didn’t get why a beautifully equipped room with super classy bathroom sinks, basin and wonderful rain shower, should somewhat oddly sit adjacent to half a ceiling of raw sprayed on concrete and an raw pillar running through the room.  It’s not poor workmanship but has been carefully designed – however, I would rather the ceiling was finished and the rawness covered up. This could have been an really head turning room, but regrettably the unfinished look didn’t do it for me. The rest of the hotel is tastefully furnished and has a look and feel of quality about it. Regrettably I was only here for a single night so didn’t really sample all its attributes nor its top floor swimming pool.",4

Not a very long walk with luggage from metro station. English speaking and cordial reception desk. They handed over the room more than 2 hours in advance as it was ready.  The lift was out of order, but the reception guy helped by carrying most of our luggage through the 3 floors. Room is lovely, light and airy. It was a lot bigger than I would have expected to get something in the city centre. It was more like a 2 bedroom hotel with a separate room having a sofa bed (see pic) and TV in each room.  Very nicely fitter and spacious bathroom.  Note, the lift started working the next time we came back from a tiring visit around the city…",5
4865,Wow - took one hour to check in and then way overpriced.  Check in at desk took 10 min just for us.  Supposed to be the tech capital of  the world and they were having technical difficulties — really.  That was a bad start.  Then they wouldn’t even acknowledge you as a person but asked for your Id and credit card but not your name.  Didn’t happen to warn that parking was $66 either.  Stay somewhere cheaper and drive here 😉,1

T-Cooking fasilities in the room, and available slippers and robe to get to Your bathroom (not ensuite). Complementary minibar and very flexible check in / check out makes this the Place to stay in Berlin. Much nicer than any standard hotel. A bit expensive.

We could close the door so he had his own room - a real treat when staying in a hotel! The suites have large furnished balconies that look toward the sea (down a road) and a lovely bathroom with jacuzzi bath. We will definitely stay again, money permitting. Very pleased we paid extra for the suite which was really lovely!!",5

Alex put up with my jet-lagged attempts at French while I checked in and saw to it that we had coffee and croissants while we waited for our room. The next day Edgar not only provided directions for us for local restaurants, but he actually walked us half way down the street to make sure we could find it. Top class customer service. Hotel itself is in a great location...we walked from the hotel to all the attractions. Plenty of restaurants and bars close by.

During our stay, the toilet broke, the TV stopped working and there was (not our) blood on the sheets. When we told reception about this, they said we'd have to tell the maid in the morning. And they kept hold of my credit card for four days after we checked in. Fortunately I don't use it much, but was in a panic when I realised it was missing until they finally informed me they had it.  Just seemed like no pride was taken re presentation of this motel. I suppose the money keeps rolling in due to fair location so I guess they have no reason to worry.",1
4877,Iliovasilema has a great view overlooking the caldera. It is located at the highest point of the island Imerovigli so the views is really amazing. That's about all that was worth it for this hotel. Rooms are very outdated. The bed and breakfast I paid extra for was only continental and I wasn't warned about that when booking. If I knew I wouldn't have paid for it. Although the manager was very kind and helpful I wouldn't stay there again without upgrades and renovations. For those complaints I couldn't rate the hotel any better. ,3
4878,"An ok hotel, (for those from the UK it reminds me of the Malmaison chain), in a very good location. We had 2 rooms one a ‘superior’ to fit in an extra bed. It’s all fine though am surprised by comments about a good bathroom, ours was a sliding door and a curtain. Hardly 5 stars. Remember if you are not booking a river view then you’ll be on the back of the hotel as one of our rooms was and looking at someone’s washing being hung out to dry. I’d agree with others that breakfast was good and staff helpful especially the tall chap on the front door.",3

This one has all you need in solid 3 stars properties, for example: TV, safe, bathroom amenities, daily housekeeping and buffet breakfast. I would add nice bar, computer station, library as extra amenities.  If you prefer better comfort choose any room upper Classic. It's really worth it. We stayed in Classic but were happy anyway despite small room and bath size. We are experienced travelers and we were not surprised with it, because we read description and I was in Paris before. The main advantages are nearness to metro (Cadet or Poissonnière) and walk distance to Opera/Lafayette galleries.

The good:  The hotel itself is great, reception and ambience overdelivered, the view that opens up from the reception is amazing. The staff are also on the whole attentive and friendly. Our rooms (1016 and 1011) both had great views and were very clean and well maintained. We emailed ahead and asked for rooms that didn’t have open plan bathrooms as we felt out teenagers who were sharing probably wouldn’t appreciate a toilet that wasn’t private!!!

Everything is within an easy walk to local restaurants and shops. Its located on a busy street but we couldn't hear the noise in our room. Had an enjoyable dinner.  Must have a drink on the roof top lounge and watch the sun set.,4

We tip our hats to the owner who has obviously hired excellent management who has in turn hired excellent dedicated, happy,motivated people. We arrived very late in the evening and despite the hour Nicolas was there to meet us with a large welcoming smile and he was happy to make sure we had all the information we needed about our stay. This atmosphere continued throughout the week with all the staff being friendly and helpful.   If you need a big working desk, 300 hundred channels on the TV or an 80m^2 bedroom - don't stay at Vice…",5
4884,"The resort is nice enough, but don't even consider coming here unless you are seriously rich. They do not miss an opportunity to fleece you, be it exorbitant resort fees or eye-watering prices in their restaurants. Makes it hard to relax when you feel like a hotel is extorting money from you.",2
4885,"Located in the heart of the tourist sector of Lisbon parallel to the main tourist ‘drag-way’. You know the sort of thing I mean, an area full of restaurants with laminated menus and a waiter standing outside trying to persuade you to eat in his establishment, when you are going out for the evening.  So, if you are happy with staying in this sort of area, then fine. Personally, it’s not my ‘cup of tea’.  The SJ hotel itself is functional, clean, attentive and the rooms were spacious with a good bathroom lay-out.  So what was missing? Charm is the first thing that springs to mind. No central point in which to congregate such as a convivial bar, in which you could meet and talk to fellow travellers. No character in the rooms such as art, interesting furniture, decor.  Breakfast. In…",3
4886,"Half an hour after arrival by hotel car, we called to ask what had happened to our luggage.  An hour after ordering from room-service at 10:30 PM, we had to call to ask where our meals were.  Empty minibar.  Their cheapest wine for room service was listed at 85 yuan (an incredible $13).  But, ""We're out of that.""  The cheapest available was $20 a glass--twice the price in the US.  Stupid beyond words.  Their Chinese food was barely edible.  Their conception of ""sweet and sour fish"" was ""here's the bowl of sweet and sour sauce.""  Asinine.  Maybe their Western food, at 50% above the high prices for Chinese food, would have been a bit better.  The breakfast is good, immense selection of buffet items.  But, factor that against a room price (including the breakfast) of $270.  Don't…",2
4887,"My mom and I spent 6 nights at the Hotel Adele & Jules. It was a fantastic experience! The room was clean and the beds were super comfy! The bathroom was great, especially the shower.  We cannot say enough about how kind the entire staff was, especially Adrian. The location was great, very close to lots of cafe, shoppings etc but the hotel itself is located down an alley which makes it very quiet. I would highly recommend this hotel!",5
4888,Check your sheets before sleeping in this hotel. Make sure they were actually change within the last week.  Not too many questions at once for the front desk. They aren’t the best multi-tasking team.  Try not to take a shower here. The mildew will eat you alive.,1
4889,"This hotel is modern (with beds that allow you to change the degree of firmness!) but for non-cruise ship passengers, it is not very convenient. When I booked, I thought it looked like it was right next to the train station but it's around a 15-minute walk to get there. It's just one tram stop if you want to do that but all of the main sights are off a different tram line, adding to your travel time. If I had realized, I would have just booked a place right in the heart of the city. ",3
4890,"This property was far below my standards and my expectations.  The hotel has no restaurant, no bar, no workout facility and no pool.  Our room was too small for 2 people although it supposedly accommodated 4 guests.  You couldn't use the sink in the bathroom unless the door was closed.  Access to the closets was very tight.  The room had no exterior windows except to a shaft.  The lighting in the room was awful.  The bed was uncomfortable. Front desk service was just adequate.  ",2

4892,"Booked a room for a single night but then had a change of plans. I cancelled well within the allowed time limit (up to 4 pm the day of the stay) but they went ahead and charged me anyway.   I have called them multiple times but keep being sent into voicemail and then I get no return phone-call. Basically, they're thieves and have forced me to go to my CC company to dispute the charge.",1
4893,"We stayed in two rooms for 4 nights. Nice size rooms. Very pleasant decor. Comfortable beds. Good  and plentiful breakfast.  Alexandra was wonderful making changes to our rooms after booking due to extra family members joining for a couple of nights. She sorted out flight changes for us too which couldn't be done online. She is very professional, cares about the hotel guests and everything is done with a smile.  Train station  gare de lyon RER a 5 minute walk and you can go to eurodisney direct. Metro bastille also a 5 minutes walk. We went to roland garros from metro gare d'Austerlitz which was a 7 min walk, which saved changing metros and guaranteed a seat.  Spent the last evening at a cafe near the hotel eating drinking and people watching.   Will be back next year for sure ",5
4894,"Well kept small hotel in a residential area, 10 minutes walking from the the Alameda subway station (direct from the airport). Take the Henrique Alfonso exit but be prepared to climb a steep hill up to the hotel. Room was O.K. but coffee/tea facilities include only a water kettle, so bring along your own coffee or tea! There is free internet but internet connections often fail to work properly. The room is small but the beds are very comfortable Buffet breakfast is O.K. as well, but only basic.",3

The front desk never said anything about the water issue there were signs in the elevator it said it would be back on at 3 pm. We left to go eat lunch and find restrooms, we got back at 330, still no water, we had to leave again to get water and restrooms, we finally got water at 610 pm. The room was not level I felt like I was having bad vertigo. Worst hotel experience at Best Western ever,...Will not return to this place.",1
4898,"We stayed at Springhill Suites River North and brought bed bugs home in our garment bag!  This was confirmed by canine detection and the hotel is denying any responsibility.  We are in excess of $2500.00 for extermination charges, first round only, could be as many as 3 treatments. We had to cancel our daughters high school graduation party because our home is unlivable!  This has been traumatic and devastating to our family.  This beg bug room also cost us nearly $900.00 for a 3 night stay!  You may bring home more than just memories of your time in Chicago if you stay at Springhill Suites!",1
4899,"The rooms are small but enough for a short stay. The hotel is not near the centre of town, but it is a short cycle away. They have bicycles for rent in the hotel, so you can use them to come and go. Good price for Amsterdam (which is generally quite expensive for lodging).",3
4900,"Was only in Paris for 2 days. This hotel was beautiful, quaint and stylish. The staff were VERY friendly and accommodating. Offered tips on great places to eat while we were there, and I must say, the advice was excellent. Would definitely recommend this hotel for your Paris stay. About an hour walk to the Eiffel Tower but also lots of transportation options; I wanted to walk so I could see as much as I could in the short time I was there. Rooms are small by North American standards but clean and updated; let’s face it, you’re only sleeping in there anyway. Will stay here again.",5
4901,"very bad location, very deceptive hotel. friendly staff but no sense of service. very noisy you hear everything thatvis going on in corridor and in room next door. no restaurant, very bad breakfast. too expensive for what it is. just a repainted freshened up old run down hotel.",1
4902,"I booked this hotel based on the good reviews, but left after one night.   The lights in the room broke at night and could not be turned on again - something I never experienced at any hotel before. I reported the issue and expected it to be fixed by the morning, but nothing happened and I had to remind the staff again. Also, the bath area flooded after taking the shower and all they did was to wipe instead of fixing the issue.   Staff quality was very disapppointing. When I asked upon checkin if I could have the room a bit earlier, the staff did not even bother to check or make any effort to that regard. When walking around the pool area, security approached us and asked whether we are staying at the hotel.   The pool is right next to the lobby, which makes the pool feel less private and the lobby quite crowded.   So overall very uncomfortable and way too many issues to enjoy a holiday.…",1
4903,"We booked about 6 months early on some special deal - unfortunately, it seemed we were given the worst room in the hotel, as we didn't even have a proper shower. It was just a hose and a shower curtain and you basically had to shower on top of the toilet.  Also, our hot water didn't work for the first two nights despite telling the staff.  And, our air conditioner rattled and turned on and off the entire night. Having said that, once we told Mario, the owner, he was nice enough to change us to a much better room.  If we had had something similar to that in the first place, we would have enjoyed our stay much more. He was very apologetic however, and we were grateful that he listened to our concerns.  the hotel is quite charming, with a lovely pool area and bar which fortunately…",3
4904,Stopped in to have a drink at the bar and wait for a client staying at the hotel.  Had trouble with the wifi (after purchasing a drink) and the bartender suggested rebooting PC which I did.  Then she called over what turned out to be the bar manager and I explained I was having trouble with wifi.  He asked if I was a guest at the hotel and I said no I was having a drink at the bar.  He turned and walked away.  Crossing that place off my list.,1
4905,"I enjoyed a one-night stay here and was very impressed with the hotel and personal attention I received. I was upgraded to a loft suite on the top floor of the hotel. The interior space and exterior views were fabulous.  Breakfast in the hotel lobby restaurant was terrific. There is a great deal of variety, including organic foods. All were delicious.  I especially appreciated the personalized attention I received from Keiko of guest relations.",5

EVERYONE working there were extremely friendly and helpful.  They coordinated a car to pick up us at the airport and Gwendoline even called them when our flight got delayed to let them know.  Melodie was also very helpful.  Our room (Give me the night)  was very clean and the bed was extremely comfortable.  The glowing red tub was awesome.  The hotel was very quiet and there was very little street noise in the mornings. We only ate breakfast in the hotel one morning, but the selection was great and the food was very good.  We also loved the ability to make a fresh cup of coffee in the mornings as we headed out to explore the city. If you are…",5

Coffee itself - colleague's cappuccino and my macchiato were okay; none of the small cookies were offered, and no water (till we asked).  At the meeting rooms, the sandwiches served were, well let's just say, we make them better at home. No paper napkins :(  And I kept thinking to myself that I'm just being too harsh on their service standards as I called for my car! Guess what, for some reason, they were able to dirty my car as well. If you're interested to know, some water pipe in the parking leaked dirty water and that's that. Well, the least one would expect is to have done the basic about cleaning the vehicle!  Apparently I was on the wrong side of them on this trip. Earlier dinners have…",2
4908,We stayed in the tower wing from 29 December 2012 for 5 nights. Our first room a suite overlooked a busy road. The second room was very modern but although described as a luxury king was lacking in storage space. There was no room for our 3 suitcases which were put on a rack facing the bed. As we complained we did not want to look at our suitcases we were moved to another room same style but larger. This had such noisy air conditioning we could not sleep with it on so we were uncomfortably hot. The Engineer said the noise was normal. Not so. The breakfast buffet was served on a small table with limited choice. Bowls were not refilled unless requested. The hotel is overpriced and whilst the staff try to please there does not seem to be any one person in control. Would not…,2

Short tempered with most guests, using the excuse ""this is a hostel"" whenever appropriate!

I was informed that I will receive a text once it is ready. At 4 PM, there is still no text. We went to the reception only to be informed that our room is not cleaned yet. We were given another room instead, on a higher floor, with the same room requisitions. I asked why I was not able to check in early as a gold member, and was informed that an early check in is not guaranteed and check in is at 3 PM. I just thought to let it go, and went to our room.

My husband is working and I cannot open the closet while he is in there.   We are staying for ten days and there is no place to unpack. The drawers (4 of them) are one inch deep and the credenza has three drawers that are only deep enough for papers.

4917,we stayed in this hotel because it was relatively affordable but I don't think it deserves three stars. There are a lot of things that are lacking in detail;   negatives:  for example the shower curtain does not reach the very bottom so you flood the bathroom every time you take a shower. Also there is no second chair even though the room is plenty big. There is no hairdryer and you have to go to the reception to get one and when we were there they had none left so I had to go outside with wet hair and I froze my butt off. Other small details like the steps outside that are ridiculously narrow. and the beds are pretty small and there is no night table and the rooms only get cleaned every couple of days so you don't get any fresh towels and not even if you ask for some at the…,3

Check in took 35 minutes then I I got to my room is had a bad smell it seemed he gave me a smoking room even though it says on my profile non smoking so back I went to front desk and Rex took him another 20 minutes to sort it out it seems that they wanted to save me money on the room and let me stand at the reception until morning... Then finally I arrived to my room/closet I wanted to cry but I was to tired.  The room was really tiny and…,2
4919,Hotel staff are very nice and friendly. Facilities are modern and offered us a comfortable stay. We also love the fresh buffet breakfast that they served every morning. The location is not very central - by this I mean it is not walkable to the tourist sights in Lisbon if that's what you are after. It is 3 metro stops away and about half a kilometer walk to the nearest metro on the slightly uphill road. Their accommodating staff and breakfast were our favorites!,3

Be prepared to find your room smaller than in other places but this is a trait this hotel shares with many centrally located places im Paris. I will come again.",5
4921,I had to ask a change of room as it was located below the aircondition equipment on the roof causing a continuous low noise; re-located to Herman Brood suite.  Specious with 2 area's seperated by big sliding glass door. Herman Brood art (repro??) on the wall; quote's painted on the walls he used to make a point or 2.

Very comfy bed, great shower (plus an outside one on the terrace), plenty of space in the room with lots of toiletries and other goodies provided. The walls are a little thin though - we weren't disturbed fortunately. No noise at all from outside.

It sells itself as an eco-friendly ""boutique"" hotel, but my experience was closer to a second hand charity shop, apart from the prices. Great that it is ""100% wind powered"" and is doing its best for the planet, but that doesn't excuse shoddily furnished rooms and service. Although reasonably sized, bedrooms are spartan in the manner of a second rate motel and as most look out at a brick wall, they have little natural light - my window was only 3 feet from this wall (see photo)! To make matters worse, the bedside light was so weak that reading was impossible. There were many problems with the room, such as the bathroom sink not draining properly, the air conditioning…",2

Exceptionally friendly staff who can't do enough for you; clean, comfortable rooms and a really nice restaurant located at the side & accessed from within the Hotel serving breakfast and good value / quality meals and beverages throughout the day.  The hotel is situated a 2 minute walk from the Metro train station which provides access to wherever you need to go within Berlin. This is by far one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in, in recent years. Competitively priced, you won't go far wrong if you choose this hotel as a place to stay when visiting Berlin.",5
4926,This was rated as 4 star but our room was certainly only a 2 or 3 at the most. I don't know if we got the worst room in the hotel because we booked through Wotif but the bathroom was grotty and the shower was damp all around the floor. Room was small and bed head was close to door of the bathroom so if you went to the bathroom in night the light shone directly on other person in bed - configuration of room terrible! There was construction going on next door and even though we were on 10th floor the workmen were directly outside our window so had to keep the curtain shut. Certainly would NOT stay again.,2
4927,Lovely hotel situated directly by the beach. Right next to the diagonal mar mall however a bit far from a lot of the restaurants near marina bay but only a 20 minute walk away or a short taxi journey. Staff were very friendly on arrival and also lovely customer service from the staff cleaning the rooms! Pool sunbathing area is limited due to both pools being quite small - holds around 15 sunbeds at each pool (there is 2). Overall a pleasant stay and would certainly recommend this hotel.,4

I attached some photos in this regard. Anyway, room was clean and nice and had comfortable sleep, Dinner was good except the tomato soup which was rather tomato sauce. Breakfast was excellent with lot of items other than too much fried bacon. No tea facilities available in the rooms.

This review is strictly about the excellent service we received on a recent short trip to Paris. Jerome during the day and the night manager were very instrumental in making sure that we were well taken care of. We had a couple of major obstacles to overcome in the three nights we stayed, and they assisted us with the greatest of professionalism.

The big bathroom was created at the expense of the closet, which we could almost manage. But someone decided to put the safe in the closet which meant that you could not hang up ANYTHING.  2. Free ranging children are the norm here. I like kids but don't book this place unless you are ok with screaming kids being watched by adults that seemingly are proud of that behavior.  3.

Could not get in to the hotel without a wrist band, lots of security checking everyone going in and out, no room service and minimum food menus at restaurants, no new towels for our room, and loud labor strike all day and into each night. On top of that, they were doing renovations at the hotel (which it needs because outdated and looks more like an airport hotel). We love Marriott and overall this was subpar for Marriott standards.

Some included the fact that the room can not be heated because it’s on a central system so no matter how cold you are at night you are out of luck.  The restaurant evra had amazing decor but there were a lot of bones in my fish that they missed and I almost choked on them. We got a late check out of 2PM from reception but at around 1PM a person who collects bags asked why we hadn’t left the room. We told him we had a late check out.

To begin with, I had to make several emails with the reception regarding a transfer from the airport as advertised on the website. The hotel offers a free shuttle which drops off at the chains other city hotels first, or can arrange a private taxi (at additional cost). The emails exchanged were very inconsistent!

When we were escorted into our room, we were delighted with what is truly a 5-star accommodation (with champagne and strawberries as I had pre-ordered). The room design and appointments are truly SPECTACULAR, very modern, comfortable with amazing views and vistas. The restrooms (a master and guest) were extraordinary, with dramatic lighting, marble appointments, heated floors and wonderful showers, baths (and of course, those comfy Waldorf robes). Storage, dining and kitchen areas were…",4

Internet is free, but a joke. It`s difficult to reach any site, because is very slow. I saw myself using only 3g, that had a better speed. The elevators demand to use the room key, but don`t work properly, so more than once I end up traped going up and down without reaching my floor. Breakfast is not good also, very poor. You have to be patience, since there is line for check in, check out and to get a cab.",2

This hotel through the years had a lot of brands and now crowne plaza! At check in I was recognise as a member and my room was in good shape and went to my floor preference. The room was fine but air conditioner left a bit to desire, so the housekeeping. The breakfast is very blend, not up standard. My main issue was to see that the hotel accept dogs. I refer this issue at check out and the manager in charge had a word with me to give me information how they deal with cleaning of the room that have dogs. Just don't won't to know!",3

The hotel is conveniently close to a U-bahn station which is your key to seeing the fabulous city of Berlin in a quick and easy way, there is also a bus stop across the street which takes you directly to the amazing Berlin zoo.

As a matter of fact, I'm still wondering who could give my money back.

Great location: metro right across the street, a short walk to the Eiffel Tower, a grocery store very close by and a variety of restaurants just outside the front door. The hotel itself is older but charming with the usual smaller size rooms - the perfect French experience in my opinion. The staff are so friendly and helpful. I don't think I can find anything negative to say. I feel so lucky to have found this online. Thank you Eiffel Seine Hotel.",5
4964,"In a nutshell, this hotel has let itself down. The rooms are sliced in half to make more and are so tiny! My partner and I were constantly trying to squeeze past one another. There was no mirror in the bedroom which was odd.   We had booked a double bed. It was two SINGLES pushed together and the gap kept opening up in the night and we both found ourselves falling in the gap. see pic. We both woke with back ache.  We complained and it turns out most of the doubles are 2 singles pushed together .  Breakfast was ok but not outstanding.  The reception/bar was nice, the staff were friendly and the location great for museums.  Wouldn’t go there again.     ",3

It took 30 mins to order room service, after the receptionist misunderstood what we asked for, sent somebody up, then rang to tell us they didn't have those dishes, misunderstood what we ordered again and sent somebody up again. Eventually we got our food which was average as I expected.  Breakfast was awful, no butter for the bread, no fruit and when I ordered scrambled eggs they bought over an omelette 10 mins later. When I said that it was wrong and that I ordered scrambled eggs, they just replied 'yes' and waked away. We waited 20 mins but the eggs didn't arrive, and when I looked in to the kitchen they had just stopped and started cleaning,  so…",2

Great value for money (at least for a last minute booking), the bed was comfortable, perfect shower and good breakfast (nespresso machine and the best sweet croissants he ever had + ham, eggs, toasts, etc.). If they served freshly squeezed O.J. it would have been his ideal breakfast.  The location is unbeatable, 2 minutes from La Pedrera and Casa Batllo, 10 minutes walk from Las Ramblas, but still in a relatively quiet street.  Only negative point was the internet connection, it was very spotty and didn't work in the rooms.",4
4967,"We stayed for 3 nights, and it did that very well.  It's just off Kufürstendamm, near to Uhlandstrasse U-Bahn and Savigny S-Bahn.  A couple of other stations are in very easy reach.  The Reichstag/mad TV Tower area are 15 minutes or so away, inc the walk to the station.  Rooms are comfortable, and surprisingly large.  You get a walk in wardrobe, a comfy bed with the two duvet thing that is both pleasing and slightly soulless.  Staff were very helpful, and with shamefully good English; far ahead of our rusty German.   There's no separate bar, but we did get drinks at the restaurant attached.  Breakfasts are in a separate room, an extension of the entry lobby.  They're great. So it did us very well; we'd happily go back again.  I've given it 4 stars, as it isn't extraordinary, but…",4

We chose the Phileas Hotel as I had stayed at the location when it was in it's previous incarnation and knew that it was in a very convenient place which has a lot of bars/restaurants within a short walk as well as good transport links.   However, other than it's location it feels like a completely different hotel. The new owners have undertaken a fantastic renovation and the hotel now has a very tasteful Jules Verne theme. All done to a high quality, all very attractive.   We travelled by Eurostar to Gare du Nord & then took the RER 'E' line from Magenta station [adjoins Gare du Nord] to Gare St Lazare. The hotel is on Rue d'Amsterdam which runs alongside the station. Despite the proximity though, we were not bothered…",5

The location is great just on the verge of de Jordaan and the place has a nice boutique feel about it.

Would have rated it much higher if the price was different...,3

In the room you were supplied with a little drawstring bag that would be filled with a small gift if it hung from your door handle, indicating that the room did not need servicing. The gifts were chocolates of an incredible degree of sweetness! Breakfast was outstanding. I usually find this is the best meal of the day in Germany. At the evening meal the hotel staff insisted on charging 4 Euros for bringing you a jug of tap water which exasperated me.",4

Although marked as a non-smoking room, the room had a strong tobacco smell. This takes away 1 star   2. I stayed in 611.

I was traveling with my 83 year old grandmother and they looked after her like she was there own! Even being very accommodating when we requested to stay an extra 2 days and making things work out so that she didn't have to move rooms!  If you're traveling to Cannes this is a fantastic find and really cannot be beat, especially given the price.  EASY walking distance to the beach and main parts of Cannes, literally less than 5 minutes to everything.",5

You have to wave and shout to get any attention. No one cleans the tables outside where we were sitting. They are dirty and unappetizing. No one cleans up after guests have left. The table next to us was littered with cups and glasses and napkins etc for at least 1 1/2 hours and I pointed it out to a waitress and still nothing happened. We sat there for more than 2 hours and no one came by to any of the tables to ask if anyone wanted to order something. How they make money here is a mystery to me. Great location, super building, bit it's a mess! Pity.",3

Reception staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. The rooms were spacious, comfortable and very clean. We had a drink in the bar before we went out in the evening. From 5pm to 7pm is happy hour with two cocktails for the price of one. The Long Island ice tea was amazing! I would definitely recommend this hotel as a great base to explore an amazing city. ",5

Quite an achievement. This will be a very detailed review, so you can't say you didn't know if you decide to stay there anyway.   1) Check in took awhile, we were in their deluxe room category which promises beach view and a larger room. I requested months in advance a room on a higher floor to enjoy the vista of Copacabana Beach. Well, we ended up on the 10th floor, so we were accommodated. Alas, the electronic room lock didn't work, and the air condition produced such a puddle of water that they tried to fix the air…",2

The hotel was about 1.5 hrs from EZE airport at 7 am; and I believe it's a 30 min ride from AEP airport.  The centric location is a plus for some shopping or dining at Puerto Madero, but dangerous to walk.   For sure I won't stay here next time...",2

The bad news: it's impossible to find, because the ""street"" that it's on is actually a staircase.  So call when you arrive, and if someone is there, they will talk you in. Another negative: you're on your own after midnight -- no one employed by the hotel stays through the night.  I suppose that's not a really big deal, and there is a phone number to call in case of emergency, but it was a bit disquieting.  In summary, if you're young and don't mind uphill climbs, you'll be fine here.  If you're old and looking to be pampered, look elsewhere.",3

Finally they said they had one, and when we got to it, it reeked of air freshener (undoubtedly just sprayed to disguise the smoke smell) and had an ashtray and matches on the table. Back to the desk, where they said they couldn't refund our money if we left. Asked to talk w Steve, the manager, whose name I found on Trip Advisor. They reached him by phone, and my husband told him about him being allergic to smoke, and amazingly, they came up with another ‘non smoking’ room.

Nevertheless 20 degrees means short and t-shirt with a bit of sun on your face.  The hotel itself is average, no better or worse than one might expect from a five star hotel. Staff were all very pleasant, breakfast was good but facilities varied a little. Indoor pool, sauna and steam room were very good. The gym was basic and the outdoor pool was lovely but rather cold, I don't suspect it is heated, later in the year I am sure it would not be a problem but, if you are looking for an outdoor 'dip' in March you had better be brave!

The front desk completely ignored us(no greeting or kindness) but any time a white guest came in, they were treated with kindness and not ignored. One of the front desk men in particular held the door for white guests but as soon as another black woman was coming, he decided to ‘look busy’. We don’t do business with racists and apparently as I was looking up other stories, this happened to other black guests at a different Mariott in this country.   These ignoramuses need to be fired or severely reprimanded for this inexcusable behavior.",1

There is plenty of space to hang out around the hotel and these spaces are varied and a real boon. I could sit by myself and read for hours overlooking the sea just outside the restaurant.

The hotel meets my expectations for German business-oriented hotels - decent breakfast, polite staff, clean rooms, free internet and good television with some English channels. As usual, the shower stall is too small so moving around can cause the tap to shift leading to a sudden unwelcome change in temperature.

We stayed 3 nights at the Chicago Marriott Residence Springhill, in March 2018. We travelled to Chicago to see ""Hamilton"" and were really excited about the trip! The hotel, however, was a great disappointment. The breakfast on 3/30 was so overwhelmed with people, that much of the food had ""run out"", we were told. We arrived at around 830am.

This was really rude! We called the reception and asked for an upgrade to the beach front villa which would be 19$ in additional for one night. We decided to upgrade and moved to another Villa which was amazing. The design and the private pool are just great, as well as the outdoor bathroom.

I tried to check in at mid-night and had to change 6 rooms one worse then the next. I finally agreed to a room that felt like a dungeon at 5am.  The hotel rooms are smaller then a NYC bathroom, they are outdated and dingy (one of the rooms I was changed to smelled like cat urine).

Nice hotel, not bad location as close to shops and restaurants but we used  the train and underground every day to get most places of interest for sightseeing. If you’re looking to be more centrally located, I’d suggest the other Sofitel which is close to the Berliner Dom and museum island. There’s a small but nice spa and gym area, we didn’t eat in the hotel as there are plenty of places close by to eat but the main restaurant looked nice but quite expensive. The rooms are large and have everything you’d expect from a Sofitel with good customer service. ",4

There is not in-house gym, but Pump just 2 minutes across the road is well equipped and take day bookings.  Lisbon's excellent metro also means you can head into downtown area with relative ease.

5059,The room was small with a very small TV. The glass balcony door was cracked and unsightly. The balcony view wasn't that great. I'd rather prefer to go to a waterfront hotel closer to Docklands. Staff were not very friendly.,2
5060,JW Marriott @ Avenida Atlantica is in need of some TLC We had to pay extra for an early check in & late check out .... and this is what we found inside an oceanfront room QC at its best huh???? The rooftop pool is a joke No ATM machine on site We will not go back,2
5061,"First of all, hotels are expensive in Stockholm so it is very difficult to find a place with a good value for the price is not easy to find. The stay at stockholm is very average but with a premium rates. It feels like a dorm room, there is a lot student around to press that impression with the university close by. On the plus side, the bed are comfy, the internet speed is fantastic for a hotel but that is about it you do not have anything else. The breakfast is average not a lot of choice but good altough it is outside the hotel. The main advantage is it location, right in front of the metro and very close to a mall and walking distance to the university.",3
5062,"Very inconvenient, that there is not refrigerator in room. Beds are slipping on the floor. Wi-Fi perfect. TV - perfect. Location - good enough. Stuff - very good. Clean enough, but towels could be changed, if it is on the floor in bathroom. ",4
5063,"Arrived at the Moov to a lovely looking frontage and polite chap on the desk. Got to the room which was very clean and tidy but basic. Low bed, thin pillows, thin towels etc the view from our room was let's say depressing! We asked the lady on reception if we could possibly change rooms and was informed no! Yes it is near to the places of interest and tram stop, so we didn't let the disappointment of the hotel spoil our trip. We did find the area a wee bit off putting by the beggars that appeared from nowhere and would often follow us. Wouldn't stay here again ",3
5064,"We stayed here for 3 nights. The location is perfect - just a short walk from Alexanderplatz which means lots of meal, drink, public transport and entertainment options right at your doorstep. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the room was large and clean. Pillows were useless but we made do. Shower was difficult and it leaked from under the shower curtain and flooded the bathroom easily. But no other issues. We had buffet breakfast daily and the hotel restraurant was open 24/7 but I wouldn't recommend eating there when there are so many other options so close by. Beers were cheap here though and they had nice tables and chairs at the front of the hotel so that was nice! Overall great hotel and would recommend.",5
5065,"This hotel had everything on paper... Almost brand new, lots of services and infrastructures... but only on paper. Personnel at the reception was kind on our arrival. But a few hours living in the holel and almost none of the supposed services were actually delivered. Rooftop restaurant and pool were closed way before the official time. The place although it's a big building seemed empty, and it was the only time in Vietnam where I felt a kind of solitude that you normally only experience in a business trip... Very sad, I wouldn't recommend this hotel.",2
5066,"The property is beautifully located on the beach with clean spacious rooms.  Breakfast buffet is most impressive with lots of variety and excellent quality.  However, the dining area feels like a noisy cafeteria with lots of active young children running around, dropping food, chairs rubbing on the tiled floors-like finger nails on chalk board.  Restaurant service is extremely slow at all times.. With limited English skill and lack of training,  I witnessed frustrated diners complained on many occasions during my 3 days stay.  The worst was the ""compulsory"" New Year Eve Buffet in the banquet room.  We were subject to paying about $100 USD each on New Year Eve.  All guests had to check in manually and we had to stay in line for a while.   The buffet line was a single line that…",2
5067,Hotel is very close to the old historical portion of Lisbon. The area has many restaurants and travelers to match. The rooms are small but comfortable. The price is high because of the location. The morning buffet is good.,3
5068,"I unfortunately never got to stay in this hotel, as I accidentally booked our room for a wrong date. I made the booking just a few hours before arriving at the hotel, just to learn that they were fully booked and I had made my reservation for the following week. This was of course completely my own mistake. The gentleman at the reception promised to refund my booking as I had made an honest mistake. However, I never got the refund, but had to pay the full price instead. This was quite disappointing as I had been promised a refund. So my only comment is that beware of the 2 week cancellation window, although this seems to be a very popular hotel and often fully booked, if you cancel your reservation less than 2 weeks before your planned stay you will pay the full price (and the rooms are quite pricey).…",1
5069,Stayed for an international conference. Surprised no foreign staff at the front desk given it is Shanghai. Room on a supposedly non-smoking floor but other guests violated the rule and the floor smelled as soon as you came out of the elevator. Perhaps it is common in China and there is nothing the hotel can do. The lobby is on the 52nd floor of the building with rooms starting from 39th floor. Guests must take one elevator from ground floor to reach the lobby and change into another elevator to get to the room floor. Inefficient arrangement especially during a big conference with hundreds of attendees. No concierge at concierge desk at 1030am on Monday when I needed help with restaurant reservation. Overall not up to the Ritz standard. ,2
5070,"We chose this hotel due to the good location it has - and we don't regret it at all! Just downtown Paris, so close to shops, restaurant and main attractions :)  The room was sparkling clean, a little small - but this is quite usual for Paris... Great location, beautiful view from the chic balcony to Eiffel Tower, nice toiletries and polite reception staff.  Breakfast was alright, they offer traditional food, like a few types of cheese, confitures, croissants etc - it wasn't great, but at the same time it wasn't bad either...   I'll choose this hotel again next time in Paris!",5
5071,"I normally stay at the Andaz next door when I come to Shanghai for business, but I decided to try the Langham based on a recommendation of a friend. In terms of decoration it is up to par with the Andaz, and has a more traditional style, however, the service from the local staff is, how to say this politely, pretty abhorrent.  For the last couple of days I've been staying here, I've been given the stare, the sneer, the look of contempt, and completely ignored. In the gym this morning I was given the look of complete contempt that I decided to cut short my session. I'm wondering whether it's just me or maybe I'm just not welcome here. No matter, I'll spend the next couple of days away from the hotel and return to the Andaz the next time.",2
5072,"This is not a hotel with a front desk, but Anna and Simon were very helpful with special arrangements and individual attention.  Apartments are large and ... very much as described and photographed on their website!  As they say, some are up several flights of stairs.   For us, the location hit the sweet spot: easy reach of city center, but a real neighborhood where people live.  There are two tram lines close by and an U-Bahn station a short walk away.  Kastanien Backerei on Kastanienallee had good bread.  Tons of restaurants.  On the same block Teigwaren (if you can find a time they're open) was a standout, and Pune, across the street, had good South Asian food.",5
5073,"The place is modern, nice and clean, with a comfortable bed. It has a good location and a friendly staff. If you are on your own this place is perfect. But for two people it was a little small. The free wifi in the room was fast. The breakfast buffet option is good with plenty of options.",4
5074,After all the great reviews we were very disappointed. One of the main issue is no direct beach access. Yes we knew that in advanced but what we didn't know was that most of Long beach (10min away) belongs to resorts and you are moved on and are not allowed to use the loungers. Spoke to a few people staying at Daisy and most find it an issue. If you come to Phu Quoc you really want to find a resort with direct beach access. Resort itself is dated especially the pool area is tacky. Some reviewers mentioned that Daisy is a 5 star resort for a 3 star price. They must have never stayed at a 5 star resort? Wifi was suuuuper slow which was annoying. Good points: super friendly staff.,2
5075,"Recently stayed here with my husband for a 3 day break.  Very helpful staff and friendly concierge.  Rooms were spotless (hairdryer amazing) and lovely little extras.  Hotel is close to beautiful little restaurants and bakeries.  Metro is right on the doorstep AND a cinema, shopping centre is part of the hotel.  Overall an amazing stay - we will be back!!!",5
5076,"We stayed 3 nights at the Inn at the Opera in a queen room.  The room is quite small - with a small closet but little room for bags and other stuff. It does have fridge, microwave and coffee machine, but given the limited space you are sitting on the bed to eat or drink anything. As others have mentioned there is no air conditioning but you can open the window. In early October this worked fine for us temperature wise but you do get some city noises. The room is a bit tired and could use some freshening up, especially the bathroom fixtures, but seemed clean.  We had breakfast in the restaurant several times and it is fine for an included breakfast. Cereal, fruit, yoghurt, meat, cheese and hard boiled eggs. On Saturday they also had a waffle station. Unlike many hotels where you…",1
5077,We have just returned from this hotel. We chose it based on the reviews but what I am surprised about is that only a couple mention about how over crowded the pool area is. You can't get a bed unless you go down very early. People are sitting on the grass area because off no beds. We were there for 11 nights and it was like that nearly every day. You felt guilty leaving your sun beds to go for lunch as people would come up to you as soon as you stood up asking if they could have your beds. It really spoilt it for us as we like to go away to relax by the pool. The beds are squashed like sardines which we also hated. I believe management are aware of the problem but so far they have not done anything. A quick fix would be to eat on the other terrace and put more beds where the…,3

Huge disappoitment while finding out that the room was very tiny- could not move in the room both of us at the same time. while we arrived to the room we found out that they did not clean the toilets- it was staind and stinky.- the answer was that the receptionist is willing to come and clean beacause there are no housekeeping people after 6 pm. we changed room and- surprise ! it was even smaller the neon light was flickering like in a night club.- no technician in the area after 6 pm. we  had to spend the evening with reading lights only. they did not fix it during the following day just after we had to call the general manager to visit our room. breakfast dinnig room very crouded and noisy. public parking to far from the hotel-…,3

We ordered room service and they brought the wrong things and did not even apologize for the mixup or refund the order and instead insisted that what they brought should be eaten because it was good, and if we tried to get what we ordered it would be a long wait! Lastly we did not even get housekeeping in our room and had to call and ask and we just got a casual oh we are sorry. Terrible hotel!",1

You could also have soda milk.The staff was friendly and helpful.",4
5083,Upon arriving we were bombarded by three restaurant workers begging us to eat. I wouldn't expect this from such a highly rated hotel. The first night I noticed it was way more humid than it should be (I'm from Florida). Suspected that the a/c unit that sat in the window was not working. Called it in at 5am after it was just a too much to handle. We're told a man wouldn't be able to come until 8:30am. Fine. Day went by and it was time to sleep on night two. We arrived into our hotel only to find condensation all over the entire room that had wet the whole floor. Called in and a man arrive 30 mins later to see what we were talking about. He was not a repairan and told us the ac worked fine and that we needed to set it at 60 for it to work. Then we received a call from the front…,1

The hotel in general feels tired and the room just feels old. Carpet was dirty and dusty, sofa was stained, bathroom tiles covered in mold and the hose was rusty. Wallpaper was pilling off and it just leaves you with a bad taste. Because of the late hour i didn't complain and went straight to bed just to be awakwn shortly after by the ultra noisy aircon unit.

We were not too happy that we had to give a deposit in cash (they asked for 50 euros's per person, but we negotiated to £50 total). We got cabs into the centre of town for 6 euro's. Small supermarket nearby and a lovely coffee bar which served great coffee and pastries, much cheaper than in the city centre. 3 metro stations nearby. Would definitely go back with family or friends.",4

Our room was super small which was really a bit annoying. No room to put your luggage ( we stored ours under neath the bed ) and absolutley no room  around beds. Our view was a living room from the local family living in the building  across and their laundry and a basketball court.

The reason for the less-than-stellar review is the guest rooms, which are overly humid - in spite of the air conditioner and in room dehumidifiers.  Upon entering, the room has a definitive ""damp and musty"" odor.  (Our party was renting three rooms at this hotel, and this was noted by all of us.)  Moreover, the issue is such that even the floors become coated with a layer of moisture.  This almost caused a slip-and-fall incident. Another by-product of the moisture is that the bedding always felt damp and uncomfortable.  (Again, noted by all in our party.)  Overall, this is not a hotel to which I would return.",2

We booked with Jet2 and during the flight the aircraft developed a fault and had to divert to Faro where we spent a chaotic night. Jet2 did not handle this well in fact they were terrible. The hotel is located at the Lido and with hindsight we would stay elsewhere. The hills are steep in this area. Our room was clean and a good size but we had problems immediately. A light was flickering and there was a loud buzzing noise. We reported them and they were dealt with straight away. My problem is why does it take the customer to deal with them rather than staff. Other problems were that the bathroom door would not close as would the toilet door. Breakfast is poor for most Brits it caters more for other Europeans.…,3

5117,"We made reservations in response to an email ad that we get because we have stay at Villa Florence dozens of times over 30 years and several different owners.  There was no mention of construction that reduced lobby area, resulted in only 1 six passenger elevator for the entire hotel, no internet that worked, no manager on duty (really?) and no adjustment. And the air conditioners are still noisy and only work intermittently. Never again. Marine Memorial from now on.",1
5118,"A very average experience at this hotel. When my parent and I arrived at the Lagos train station Sd needed to get to the hotel. I hadn't been contacted ahead of time to ask if a transfer was required so I called the hotel to ask if they could call me a taxi as there were no taxis arriving at the station and the queue was very long. When I asked how best to get to the hotel as no taxis were at the station, the lady on the phone from Dom Pedro sniggered and suggested we walk. Probably not the best idea to tell someone who is travelling with four suitcases between two adults and 30 plus degree temperature. When we finally reached the hotel in a taxi (not one that was arranged by the hotel), no one at reception assisted us to our room nor any porters helped with our bags. After we…",3
5119,"Once you pull up to this hotel your first thought is ""hmmm"". The building, the street, the flats opposite the hotel, are not very appealing. To unload your luggage there is a reserved parking space, but to park your car afterwards you will have to look for a place on the street, in the neighbourhood or pay 9 euro's per day for the hotel parking, which isn't more protected than street parking and the only advantage is that at least you have a space.   The lobby is clean an functional, and the staf friendly, but not too smart. In fact it does't really feel like a 4 star hotel at all. The elevator up to the rooms is quite small, it fits 4 people plus two suitcases and the hallway feels cramped too. The rooms however are light and airy, clean and modern luxurious. A bathrobe and…",4

As I got out of the shower at 6:30, I realized - shirt's not there.  Called the housekeeping.  Reaction - to send someone in my room to look for the shirt because - apparently, the idiot that I am - I would probably be unable to find it myself(?).

Negatives  -The floor was a hard tile design, lile a kitchen floor, and was heavily stained and dirty  -The walls were scratched - the whole room was very basic. -The dark grey room with little lighting and a view onto a concrete wall 1 foot away was depressing - felt more like a prison room. - the bathroom had mould on the ceiling and the fixtures and fittings were not secure. -The only way to tell what the weather was like (important for choosing when to visit particular…",2
5122,We have stayed at the Conrad Chicago over a long weekend. We arrived late at night and found that two pillows were unchanged and their was a pill laying on the ground and the stay didn't want to clean it. The following two nights the pill was still on the ground even after talking to management twice. We are Hilton gold members and were treated like we were invisible. ,1

Broken tiles and poor repaired walls. Stained all over the toilet. No hot water. And stinky too. 3. A lady opened the door to my room with her key at 12 noon without knocking on it first. She came in and said something in broken English I didn't understand (probably check for the towels). She did say sorry many times but didn't look at me while saying so. To me that is very rude.

5125,I stayed here while attending Eurovision Song Contest so choices were limited. The room was basic but perfect for what I needed. I believe the room was newly renovated and the bathroom was very new.   From a location perspective you couldn't ask for a better location.   The staff were also extremely helpful and cheerful.,3
5126,"This is a lovely hotel with great service.  I was only there for one night but everything seemed seamless. We arrived in a group,  so were given local bubbly to soften the check in wait.  Rooms were spacious & immaculately clean - bathroom felt very luxurious,  shame I didn't have time to properly indulge.  Outside areas were very peaceful,  pool a little cold but I can imagine just perfect once the temperatures heat up in the city.  Would certainly return",4
5127,We chose this hotel because it's 20 mins on foot to the airport. So it's pretty cool if you need to stay for a night before early flight.  In general everything is ok. The only unpleasant thing was that we got the keys for the room where somebody already lived that time. So we were confused. But stuff changed the keys and we got a good room.  Also there is a small kitchen for guests who want to cook smth on their own.,4
5128,"Stayed here 3 nights with a group of 7 people. Rooms are tidy and clean. Hostel has everything you need, laundry in the basement, breakfast in the morning (7euro). In walking distance of quite a few resturants. The bar downstairs is open till super late. If you're driving here with your own car parking can be an issue. Would stay here again. ",4
5129,"Paris has been on my bucket list for over 50 years.  The Helios-Opera Hotel enhanced the experience far beyond my expectations.  From our wonderful greeting to our early morning au revoir we could not have asked for more.  The friendliness of the staff, cleanliness of the room, willingness to help in any possible way all contributed to a wonderful vacation.  We would definitely stay here again if visiting Paris.  Thank you mon amis",5

The check-in was late and there weren't facial towels or foot towels in my room. We had to ask for it! The hotel's towels were absolutely old and some was torn with stains. A maid knocked at the door for room cleaning on the 2nd day, we told her that we were leaving in 5 mins and she agreed to come back afterwards. When we came back to the room at 8 p.m., the room wasn't cleaned, the towels were still on the floor and the bed wasn't made but the list on the minibar was checked! How unplesant!! It's the first and the last time in this hotel!",2

When we picked  it up, it reeked of cigarette smoke and there were food stains on the back seat. The sound system was also messed up. It makes me wonder what they did with the car. Very worrying!",1

Within walking distance of all the sightseeing delights. The staff are very friendly and welcoming and spoke really good English. Pierre was friendly and professional. Le Marianne take great care to ensure all guests are well looked after. The continental breakfast/room service were great and the personal touches were evident all around the hotel. We can't wait to book again for next year and we would definitely recommend and look forward to staying with Le Marianne again. ",5
5133,"Windsor Barra has to my opinion, only two advantages :  (a) location and (b) genuinely friendly staff (especially housekeeping and dining room).  Air conditioning in rooms extremely noisy to the extent had to be switched off at night + could not be properly regulated.  Hotel charges for still water in room-fridge although no other drinking water is available.  Price for still water is not shown either on list (only for fizzy).  The reception to whom I complained about the fact that they should not charge for the still water, answered me that I can go and buy my own from super market (verbatim) - kind of a surprise answer for such an expensive hotel!!!  Last but not least, conduct of english by mostly all personnel is poor to non-existing (but from my experience that is a general…",2

Our greeting was awkward, as we were met at the odd front door (shared with an outdoor bar) by what seemed to be a security man, but who did not utter a word or a smile to us while he helped us with a bag or two of ours.  The rooms (we have seen many) if located with water view, can overlook an alleyway which is the primary point of collection for garbage.  In a five story hotel, where keeping windows open during a heatwave is a must (no air conditioning), being on the alley side means basically having a garbage collection truck in your room crunching refuse at 645AM.  Where the refuse comes from is ironic since…",3

This is my hotel every time I visit Paris again",5

The service staff including Albane and Massi were very helpful in meeting our requests and assisting with travel questions.,5
5138,"I had four nights scheduled here in April 2017. The thing that immediately strikes you is the decor - the common parts and corridors are extraordinarily shabby and dated, and I had hoped the rooms might be nicer. The room has amenities (e.g. decent snack bar, toiletries),  but it was tiny, the bed was uncomfortable, and the air conditioning poorly functioning - there was no air and the room smelled musty. It's an old building, and you can hear every movement from the people upstairs, as the floorboards creak.   The hotel portrays itself as being English ""shabby-chic"", but really it's just shabby. I checked out after one night, cutting my stay short, as you can get far nicer rooms in Chicago for less, and I ended up around 5 minutes walk away.  Cannot fault the staff at all, who…",1

Everything was very dated, there was a full length mirror behind the wardrobe door and I was afraid it might fall out as the beading down the whole side was hanging off. We were on the front of the hotel on the 12th floor and it was extremely noisy from bars across the road and local people singing and shouting well into the night.

If you notice carefully the shots of outdoor are shot from knee height and cover sky so they actually donot tell how far the hotel is from sea(which is very very far away).

Location is good but I would definitely not recommend it nor ever come back.  Plus there were no cribs available at the Hotel, at all.  WiFi is free only in the lobby. Elevators and hallways carpets were older than my grandma, (who is almost 100) they are in terrible shape as well.  Overall, a bad experience. I am sorry for not doing more research before arrival.

There was a desk with chair and an armchair for reading/relaxing.  The rate included breakfast in a separate breakfast room.  Breakfast had a good selection and efficient service.,4
5149,Stayed here for 11 nights in January. Although our room was spacious and comfortable it was very dated. Old style TV. Furniture badly marked and poor lighting. We had to pay 2 euros per day for use of the safe and 5 euros per day parking. This is free depending what room you are in!!!. The cooking facilities were basic. No coffee or tea provided either. Found out it would cost 4 euros per day for a couple of teabags and coffee sachets. Normally a decent hotel would have these in the room and replenish every day. The food at breakfast was good with ample choices. Service was good and everywhere very clean as you would expect. The gardens are lovely and well maintained.

It’s time to revamp your hotel culture and increase management visibility unless of course such customer service is in fact coming from management.",1

They told me price in dollars but wrote down in dong. Which turned out to be a lot more. When I argued later realising it was more the hotel said I must be mistaken. To me it was a scam which the hotel should not be doing. Other than that lovely beach and nice pool. Just be aware of the pressure of upgrading. ,2

Various Ambassador benefits were ignored and the Hotel had difficulties to fix this during our stay. Club Lounge of course was nice but food and drink offerings are significantly better in other Intercontinentals and even Holiday Inns...Policies on alcohol super-strict - don't try to grab a beer after 7.05pm...

Rooms are super small and the bathrooms are so small only one person can be in there at one time. The showers are so small you can hardly turn around - measured the shower 0.6 x 0.9 meters (2 x 3 feet). Do NOT flush the toilet if someone is in the shower - instant scalding hot water! We did not get housekeeping service one day because we were in the room until about noon. Breakfast was OK, but nothing special.

Breakfast was below average too... clean rooms but minor irritants like there were no towels in my room and no one at the reception after midnight.No way to lock your room from inside without the keys which u need to take out of the power socket and are hence plunged into darkness if you aren't  quick...that was quite funny actually. The view is good but you can catch it at many places on the island.,3

At breakfast there was a lot of choice and despite being late comers the food buffet had been replenished and was fresh. The staff were very welcoming and informative. The area surrounding the hotel has a secondary school and feels safer to walk around. Would definitely return to stay at Hotel Comete. ,5

The club room was OK.  Few choice of drink, small selection of food.  Not a huge room.  I did have one issue, we got back to the hotel late one night and had just picked up food from a local place and they would not let 6 of us use the club to eat in.

Missed the restaurant due to late collection. Was told we could go to the snack bar - 24 hours. You can charge anything to your room, except alcohol. So that required a trip back to the room to settle the account.

Soon enough, we discovered that all it did was allow little insects in to the room. Killed about 6 flying ants in probably the first 15 minutes.  Our bathroom didn't have shower curtains so water splashed all over the floor and made it slippery.

5171,We were mislead and told we are staying at the Hilton Hotel but this is a Timeshare plan in which they want you to sign up with RCI.  We never would have stayed at this location it is not on the ocean and you have to drive to get anywhere.  It is worth the extra money to stay directly at the Hilton hotel just down the road.  Do not stay at this location unless you are ready to buy into RCI.  They will not let you leave the timeshare pitch until you sign up.  It is very forceful.  We had to essentially make a scene and then they wanted us to leave so that others would not see us.,2

If this were for a week's stay at a truly 5 star caribbean resort I might expect that kind of expense but this place is more like a tired old YMCA. The rooms are small and cramped, the furniture is scratched and worn out, and the staff is more concerned with talking to each other than taking care of guests. And crazy expensive...when we arrived we sent to the outside bar area to have a drink and a snack....$230 for four! Add in all of the Florida state, local, and county taxes and a ""resort fee"" which is also taxed and you you a perfectly miserable experience.",1
5174,I love the vibe at the moxy. The staff is young and energetic and super helpful. You walk into the lobby and it’s a big wide area with lots of great places to sit and a coffee shop and snack place. There are always people working so it has a really nice energy and a nice field. The rooms are a decent size and very well organized. It’s easy to find the light switches and the outlets. The step in shower has really strong water pressure and it could separate quickly. I always care about those basic things since I travel so much. I’m Americal wards member so this is also a good place to get points and it’s not a very expensive hotel. I just rather be a little bit more sensual but this worked out well for us in terms of our budget. It’s also very close to the S Bahn and U Bahn. ,5

The most disappointing was the terrible map he gave us and vague directions. We were continually having to stop and ask. The walk down the hill at night is on a narrow road and there is very little light down here.  On our next visit to fira we would prefer to stay farther up the hill.",3

5181,We stayed here for 3 nights in February. A central location with a bar and smoking room downstairs for those feeling social. We stayed in a mixed dorm and unfortunately got there very late at night so didn't get beds near each other but other than that we had a great time staying there!,3
5182,"The hotel staff are very professional.  Restaurant food is OK. Room is not so spacious, but neat. Happened to use the printer in the business center, which doesn't work. the front desk Clark, however, was so helpful and took care the printing and scanning. Thank you very much",4
5183,"I had a better experience staying at a hostel before. I've stayed in a female dorm, sharing with more 5 girls. The room was small for 6 people. The cafe - restaurant it has nice design, a Foosball table, wi-fi, board games, but at 22.30 kitchen is closed and you can order again at the reception but on 23.30. If you want a towel (it is not included at the price of the room) you can rent it for ~4 euros. So, did I, but the towel was dirty. An overall, it was fine if you don't expect more! ",3
5184,"I will keep this brief. I enjoyed staying at hotel with my wife and two friends. Rooms ,bars ,staff and general feel of hotel were totally acceptable but the big let down was the standard of the food on offer. Luke warm breakfasts, and very little variety or quality at dinner . It's just a shame that a very important aspect of any holiday let a very nice hotel down. this comment is meant as a constructive criticism and I hope the management might take notice of an otherwise totally satisfied customer.

5185,"Rooms were very comfortable. We got complimentary, water, tea and coffee in our rooms. The location in Potsdamer Platz was very convenient; near to a train station, bus stop, tour bus stop, malls, restaurants and tourist sites.",5
5186,"My husband I spent the first couple of days celebrating our honeymoon at the Aston in Ka'anapali. Check-in went smoothly and the receptionist kindly congratulated us on our recent marriage. She mentioned that they would be sending champagne and strawberries to our room the next day; however, they were never sent. We are not ones to expect anything, but when someone tells us that we should be getting something, it doesn't look good when the promise isn't fulfilled. In addition, the room we were given was on the 1st floor with a view of the parking lot. For celebrating our honeymoon and traveling from the mainland, this was a disappointment. Lastly, the sink in our room started overflowing with water and food that smelled like vomit. The maintenance person was able to fix the…",2
5187,"I'm glad that we picked Hotel Eden on Rue Blomet.  It is located in a quiet area near small, quaint cafes.  The hotel staff are very friendly.  The rooms are clean and air conditioned!!  Super Shuttle is available from Charles De Gaulle Airport at a reasonable cost.  You can also use Uber and the public bus station.",5
5188,We had a great five night stay here at the beginning of August. Beautiful rooms and very clean. Nice lobby and bar. We found the front desk to be very helpful. Best part is the location. You can walk to so much.  Bakery and grocery store across the street. Would definitely stay here again we loved every minute of it!,5
5189,"Terrible room service. Food delivered not what is ordered, and it is cold when warm food is ordered. Sensor on lift needs to be upgraded. Front desk for check in lack of space and can be chaos with guests cutting cue.",2
5190,"Lovely airy hotel which is beautifully clean and looked after. However, for a 5 star hotel there needs to be some improvements such as better lighting in the bedrooms, a mirror above the dressing table and a longer lead on the kettle - it only plugged in at floor level.We were on level 7 which gave lovely views. Staff are friendly and gardens well kept. The rep we had however, was terrible, and only wanted you to buy excursions and just touched upon the fact that there was a carnival. We actually found out from others that it went on all week!!  The indoor pool area needs to be supervised though as lots of children (and parents) in there kicking footballs and hitting others. The jacuzzi (if you can call it that) is cold and only has 3 jets working. The sea spa which looks…",3
5191,"Hotel Is beautiful, location is not in the main Rio area but still nice on the beach, unfortunately we are very disappointed about the service. From the check in, that we had to wait 15 minutes cause there was not enough staff. Then you get 5 people at the entrance doing absolutely nothing, not opening neither hotel or taxi door. After all that they can't even replace the ""free"" instant coffee in your room or the cups. We've been in so many hotels during our trip to South America and this one was unfortunately the worse. You pay top money and they ignore you. And since it is our honeymoon I made sure they knew about it, well we didn't find any welcome gift or upgrade or anything at all. Not coming back that's for sure.",2
5192,"I have stayed here during a business trip. The Hotel is quite nice and they have a good service and breakfast, but the rooms are a bit small. Anyway the location of the hotel is perfect since it is only 2 min walk to the metro. ",4
5193,"This was a lovely hotel perfectly located close to sites, metro and great restaurants. The staff were available to help with any questions or needs and made every effort to make us feel comfortable. The room was a vibrant, colorful space, not large, but perfect for two. Exactly what I picture when you say boutique hotel. Wonderful place to stay.",5
5194,"The smell at this hotel is overwhelming and disgusting. It's like someone took 6,000 cheap taxi air fresheners and spread them throughout the hotel. At first I thought it was some group of people wearing overpowering cologne. Then I realized that this hotel actually, ON PURPOSE, pumps a ""signature scent"" throughout the lobby. The problem is it pervades the entire building. My room on the 14th floor was laced with it. As a result I felt sick and had a headache for my entire visit. It felt like being stuck in the 7th circle of hell at the perfume counter at Bloomingdales. And the hotel was full of ""sceney"" people. The room was ""hip"" but basically kind of dingy. I travel a lot but would never frequent this place again. 2 thumbs down!!!",1
5195,"Villa Blanche is an excellent B&B close to Cannes centre. We, a three-generation family has stayed there for two nights. The hosts are super nice and very helpful, they fried eggs and made espresso for everyone’s breakfast, and were very happy to explain how to explore the Cannes part of Côte d’Azur, those beautiful beaches. All rooms in Villa Blanche are stylish and comfortable. Strongly recommend to everyone. ",5
5196,The resort itself is nice. However when I had an issue with the way some charges were done and brought it to their attention rather than apologize and offer to get to the bottom of the issue the chose to blame it on my bank. Since they didn't believe what I was telling them we had to get the bank on the phone to verify the resorts mistake. Was I offered an apology after that? No I wasn't. I had to email the general manager to get an apology and again he tried to put the blame elsewhere. Bottom line they can't do any wrong there. So if you have an issue it's probably your fault or someone else's but not theirs. ,2
5197,"The hotel is quite nice, the rooms are clean, the front desk staff curteous, but...  ...how they treat customers is *horrible*  They claim a free shuttle service. I got there last night, and waited 20 minutes for the shuttle. Two showed up -- a run down old minibus and a luxury minicoach. Hotel guests were NOT allowed on the coach, and instead had to fight for a place on the minibus. It was very much a 'survival of the rudest', and I missed out. They totally refused me entry to the coach, and instead quarter-filled it with airline staff, and pulled away without another word. Ugh.  So I wait 20 minutes for a taxi and take a ride to the hotel (20 yuan). Try to check in -- they have a Christmas tree in the lobby right in front of the check in desk, and it becomes survival of the…",2

Elevator not working, I have kids to be told that TV isn't in service, had open tab at bar and found out I was charge 4 extra drinks!!! I don't want money back, or credits, I'm just simply saying I'll bet I can find a another and better option for 300 a night.   ",1
5199,"This offered 1 bedroom apartments with cooking and washing, which was very convenient in comparison with a standard hotel. The rooms are well maintained and the facilities included a small indoors pool, a fitness room and underground parking (paid, at a reasonable daily rate).   Positives included the location, and comfort particularly if you are traveling with children.  The only thing that was not up to the same standard was the restaurant. It was not bad, but average. ",5
5200,"Stay away, especially, if you are checking in late! We booked this hotel for two nights almost two months in advance and called the hotel letting them know that we are arriving late.The response was “It’s OK, you can come late” When we arrived at the hotel around 11pm, we were told that they have no available rooms and they had to relocate us to their sister hotel. We were super tired and agreed to go to another hotel. When we arrived to the sister hotel, there were two more people with the same story from the park central hotel!!!! The so called sister hotel ”hotel Diva” was the worst hotel that we have ever stayed.

5201,"Hotel was about 25min by Taxi from the Tegal Airport - Its location is good - very close to all the attractions around Alexandraplatz, Checkin was so simple - checked in online before arriving, they gave me a pin, I used the touch screen check in which issued me a room card and took about 30 sec! Hotel bar is 24/7 which is great as I arrived late and needed a beer! My room was simple but very comfortable - few surprises like underfloor heating in bathroom - shower was better than most hotels I have stayed in. All in all - would highly recommend for the price - Paid around £70 for the night single occupancy.",5
5202,"The room is small but that's not the biggest problem. The biggest problem is that the walls are way to thin. You can listen to everything that is going on on the aisle and on the other bedrooms, making it very difficult to rest. Room was clean, although they forgot to clean in one day, and breakfast is decent.",2
5203,"Facilities at hotel are very good. However, it appeared that they were always wanting more money from us. We were dragged to watch a very brief puppet show at the hotel, which you would think would be free. However, as soon as it finished, they were in our face requesting money. They were then in our face asking us to buy some of their puppets. I know this is India, but it shouldn't happen in a hotel pretending to be high standard. A short amount of wi-fi is free at the hotel, so we used that amount. When we came to check out, they demanded that we pay for additional wi-fi that we did not use. We refused to pay. Come on guys - it's 2016 - wi-fi should be free. Other people on our tour also complained about being either over-charged for items that they did use, or being charged…",2
5204,We have been to this hotel now for the third time it's in a perfect location and styled with love.  Sitting one flight of steps away from Sacre Ceour this little hotel has lovely friendly staff.  The rooms are all individually styled in what I would consider typical French romantic taste.  We have had a different themed room on each occasion.  The hotel is a few minuted walk to Anvers the nearest metro station is a 5 minute walk from Barbes and a 20 minute walk from Pigual where the Moulin Rouge is situated.  The rooms are small with private bathrooms.  I think all rooms are generally small though in Paris.  I highly recommend this hotel to all.,5
5205,"Beware that this place has a $28/day forced non optional charge for internet!! They 'give' you $10/day 'back to spend on bar (not even room bar) where notbing is less than $10 except beer. It is not just the money but the principle which is wrong. 2nd - don't expect any explanation or guidance from front desk. I found them to be extremely curt. Not sure if they were over worked or just racist.... rooms were fine, decor good. Just avoid dealing with Heather at the front desk.",1
5206,The hotel is located little away from the main attractions but i think its better you have a big mall next to it which is something good staff are very friendly and very helpful  price was very good comparing to other hotels and to the location the only thing you need to be carful when you check out anytime between 10 and 11 you might need to wait 15 to 20 min for the elevator   ,4
5207,The hotel is 15 min walk from the main attraction of the city (boat rides)  It has no bellman and no cart to carry your luggage   No pool no gym  Aged place with some smell  Would i retuen there? Probably not. I'd look for a place closer to the bridges.   The staff however waa helpful and nice.  ,3
5208,"I have rated the hotel as 4 due to its efficiency, courteousness of staff, breakfast and cleanliness. However, due to extremely hot temperatures in Berlin last week we found the room to be too hot as there is no air conditioning so had to have the windows open. Unfortunately we were on the road side which is extremely noisy not just from traffic but also from the restaurants outside so sleeping was impossible. If you happen to be in Berlin and it not be hot then the hotel will be perfectly adequate as it provides good value for money.",4
5209,"Lovely hotel with excellent spa facilities and a small but very nice pool area. We got a free upgrade to a suite which was lovely. By far the comfiest bed I had ever stayed in , at any hotel. 20 walk to the beach and sights. ",4
5210,Great location as central to all attractions and very close to the tube/station. Room was ample for a city visit and had everything you would need for your stay. Wifi was free on our stay but would be nice if there was tea and coffee facilities in the room. Breakfast was fantastic with a wide range of choice to suite all taste buds.,4
5211,"Recently visited here on holiday. I have to say the staff are lovely and welcoming. The food at breakfast which is a buffet and everything you can imagine to eat was lovely, nothing was too much trouble. The hotel although clean is very tired looking, especially the carpets in the corridor, stairs and room, curtain lining stained and worn. It could do with a huge refurbishment. The hotel also forgot to send our airport transfer, but told us that the delay was due to an accident, which was not the truth. This cost us 60 euro, so was not impressed having had to wait 35 minutes for it to arrive. In the hotels present state I would not return.",3
5212,"Good location near underground station and Av. da Liberdade, but noisy room on the 1st floor. A whole row of central air con blocks units just behind the window. Constant humming, epecially disturbing your sleep at night. Turkish bath out oа order during the stay.",3
5213,"This hotel is good value, the rooms are clean and spacious and bathrooms are also very clean and have nice fixings. The Wifi was a bit temperamental but was great when connected. The hotel is very close to the U-Bahn station which makes it easy to get into the centre of town, but you'll definitely need to use public transport to get around.  Breakfast was simple but tasty, a nice selection of cold meats, cereal and breads. The hotel staff are very friendly and helpful and there is a restaurant guide available and lots of information if you don't know Berlin well.",4
5214,"I stayed in the Rodisson Barra for a business tryp, but I was shocked how bad done the serves was. When I arrived with my coworker, two ladies in the reception didn't even bother to raise their heads from what they were doing to welcome us. We had to 'interrupt"" then to get some attention to check us in. When she started, another guess approached the reception area with a key problem and the same happened to her: she had to be really demanding with the other woman in the RECEPTION desk to get attention to solve her problem, otherwise they both just ignored her. This was truly a bad first impression. Really: RECEPTION? Once in my room, the telephone was not working. Finally,  the prices in the room service menu was outrageously high! In a positive manner I can only say that they…",2
5215,Did not like that someone came into our room while we were napping. Made us feel like we could not trust the staff. Seems like a younger crowd - but surprisingly not loud! We slept well. Would have preferred our washroom inside our room - seemed very odd to have to use our key to use our washroom across the hall.  Staff is very friendly - buffet food was good,3
5216,"I have stayed at this hotel 12 nights. I had a very good rate through Expedia, which included breakfast. The room was fine, the service was friendly and the buffet breakfast was excellent. The only thing I did not like was that the use of the pool is somehow limited some hours in the morning. There seems to be a group which does not belong to the hotel, who use it for water gymnastics. For about two hours in the morning it was not possible to swim freely. Otherwise I have liked my stay at this hotel and I would not hesitate to stay there again.",5
5217,"Stayed here for three nights  In walking distance from many tourist areas.Checkpoint Charlie very close by. Staff very friendly and helpful.

With the reception in a bar, it felt like more of a backpackers. Also pool perceived much bigger in photos and no mention of it being in another building that u had to walk to. More suited to people in their early twenties I’d say and not for a relaxing getaway. ",2
5220,Booking.com doesn’t make it clear this hotel is under construction. Nice large room but unacceptable conditions.  Hotel needs updating but should make it very clear there will be people near windows on scaffolding  and noise. Very nice size room with kitchen but wouldn’t stay here until work is done. ,1

Never stay here, the staff is unfriendly and inneficient.",1
5222,"Cheap, clean, close to the city centre, right next to a train  station, overall it has everything you need for a good stay. Breakfast was included in the price and was tasty with quite a few options to choose from, like cold meats, bread and rolls, boiled eggs, cereals, yoghurts, tea, coffee and juices. We stayed for 6 nights and each day after the breakfast apart from some small snacks we didn't have to eat again until the evening which was convenient.

This was for the last two days of the Honeymoon of our son Chris and his wife Clare. They arrived from Hawaii this evening to find that their room had been given away (outrageously, given that it was completely pre-paid). Only a standard double was available.  They were shown to a room in the 'other' block over a noisy Denny's with a very strong smell of marijuana around, and had to be moved back to a standard room in the main block.  They were kept up until 1am over this after a long flight.

5227,"We stayed in a 'superior' room; chosen because it was supposed to be larger than the cheaper rooms. The room was beautifully decorated and certainly had character, but was too small. There was only a tiny space on the floor for our suitcases (thankfully we'd only taken cabin baggage sized cases) and we had to continually step over one of them which was in the access between the bed and the bathroom.   The bathroom too was very small and it was a struggle to adjust the shower water temperature without being scalded or frozen due to you needing to be inside the tiny shower cubicle to do this.  We really liked the room decor and the ambience in the hotel, the receptionists were friendly and helpful and the self-service breakfast fairly good.",3
5228,"Overall this is a great choice. The sleek look of the room is very appealing. My only drawback was that the room was advertised as having a terrace, where one could have a drink and lunch look over at the pedera building. The problem was that the terrace was not even big enough for one person to be on a a time and definitely not enough room for a chair to relax. ",4

When we were taken to our room we were surprised by how small and dark it was.  There was very little room to hang up clothes and no drawers for tshirts etc.  We were further surprised when having been put in a room on the first floor someone walked past our window, as the outside street is a hill.  We were going to be given another room but again it was small and dark so we were offered a suite at reduced cost but still expensive.  We could have stayed in the Sofitel for the same cost as this hotel.  The bar was often unstaffed at night and the breakfast was not the best we have ever had, especially in what boasts itself…",3

The location of the hotel was excellent, just two blocks back from the beach with plenty of eating places and bars around you. It was great having the kitchen facilities and we were very impressed with the nearby Casino Supermarket. Eat your heart out Waitrose! The produce was excellent.

There was free breakfast in the morning and free hot drinks throughout the day until 10pm. The room was good for the price with separate toilet and bathroom. One negative thing was the shower room - water was splashed out after shower. The staff was super friendly and polite, would definitely stay here again if I come back to Berlin in the future. ",4
5236,"The bathroom smelled overpoweringly of sewage. What more does one need to say? And it wasn't just me. We had a large room block - I'm guessing, but maybe 30 rooms? And the predominant comment on the hotel was that the bathroom smelled. People described it differently. All said it smelled bad, except some some who said it smelled like cleaning chemicals - clearly an effort to combat the inherent smell. What more do you need to know?",1

Burberry is right on the corner, MANGO, Gucci, LV, H&M and pretty much any store you want to shop at is in walking distance.  There's tons of restaurants and cafés nearby, including Starbucks.  It's a safe neighborhood.  Also, Las Ramblas is an easy walk.  The staff, particularly Ivana, was really helpful and she called me a cab for my early morning flight.

We spent a week here over Christmas - rooms not made for the first couple days despite calling and asking REPEATEDLY; service was inconsistent - on the third or fourth day we started getting the “A-lister” housekeeping lady and realized we were missing our bathrobes and stocked amenities the first half of our stay. Every single time my husband called them they addressed him by a completely different name. When asked why the service has been horrible they gave apathetic “we’re busy” responses. Housekeeping literally entered our room one afternoon with the “private” sign on; at 6am they randomly called us. Save your money and stay somewhere else.",1

BUT there were some problems and we kept hearing it was due to the fact that the hotel had just opened.  I dont think that should be an excuse.  I had to go to the lobby to make the same complaint twice, because the cleaning staff kept taking two bath towels and replacing it with one, even though there were two guests registered to that room.  I didnt bother to complain about the coffee bar not being refilled.  Breakfast was ok, but there was no coffee and no hot water for tea, even if we complained about it.   I really hope this hotel will improve. The staff was really helpful, but you could sense that they were…",3

The bathroom was modern but the shower cubicle did not drain the water properly so you end up showering in a puddle.  The staff were very friendly and breakfast was great. Over all, for the money we paid we did not feel that the hotel offered us a five star service.",3

Kurfurstendamm is a very well known street in western part of the cityfor its stores big or biger all the well know firms are there along with biger stores like KaDeWe. The room was double with twin beds comfortable and very clean. Breakfast is quite good not so rich but with good variety. Wifi free and easy to use. Overal experience is positive and i recomend this hotel,4
5247,"This hotel is very nice and is located in a good area of Paris. The Metro station is just a few minutes by foot, and there is a bus station directly outside the hotel. What I also liked very much is that there is a local bank branch right next to the hotel, where you can safely draw out money. The rooms are nice and the beds are very comfortable. The staff is very friendly and they have tickets for museums and attractions at the front desk to purchase. The breakfast was very good, and you can get free coffee and snacks all day.",5
5248,"Arrived late at night, and was looking forward to getting a comfortable rest.   Pulled the sheet up to go to bed and found lots of black hairs from a previous occupant.   Beyond disgusting.   I didn't bother calling the front desk as it was late at night. I tossed most of the pillows onto the floor, the sheet, and then pulled the quilt's cover off and tossed that on the floor. Slept on the quilt and a used a blanket in the closet to cover me while sleeping.   See photos for the hairs. ",1
5249,"The location is first class.  The reception staff are very good to excellent. The rooms are good. Some of the restaurant staff are rude and awful, some are good. There seems to be a war going on between some of the front of house and kitchen.  We are surprised that kitchen door is still on the hinges. Alas overall there are real issues here. We are very experienced traveller and restaurant reviewers so you will see this elsewhere.  I would recommend replacing at least a few of the staff immediately and the management who run the restaurant part of the business. Again, location, reception staff and room all good to great. So if you only want a partial hotel experience this one is fine. If you want a full hotel experience go elsewhere. There are plenty about.",3
5250,"I did not stay at the hotel but visited its Willow Spa in May.  In my opinion, the spa is under-managed and has no respect for guests’ privacy.  I had a very disturbing experience which I waited more than a month before writing calmly about it.  I am an expatriate living in Shanghai for over 10 years who often go to spas in five-star hotels here, including Shangri-La, Ritz Carlton, Edition, etc.  So, I know the local practices.    The Willow Spa here is infamously known for its weird location within the hotel.  I was lucky in that a hotel executive in the lobby took me to the elevator and walked with me for a long while to reach the spa, which was hidden in the middle of the corridor on a guest room floor.  Without her, I would have probably felt very frustrated looking for the…",2
5251,"Stayed here for 3 nights early August. The hotel is absolutely fantastic. I cannot praise the hotel including the staff enough. The whole hotel, including the rooms are immaculate and clean. The room had air-con and the bathroom appeared almost brand new. The value for money was second to none. This hotel should be a 4* in my opinion, I have stayed in 4* hotels which were not as nice as hotel du Printemps. We did not try the breakfast but I'm sure it would have been lovely. There is always a staff member at reception and they are most helpful with restaurant suggestions and anything else you may need to know.   Hotel du Printemps is ideally located in a lovely area, close to two metro stations which we used frequently.   I would not consider staying any where other than this…",5
5252,"I only stayed for a night and the Hotel met all my requirements for a good night's stay.  The hotel itself looked a little dated, however the room was spacious and the beds were comfy.  I liked that the bathrooms were big and I had enough space for my stuff and to move around in.  I hate getting into the bathtub though, to take a shower.  The staff were very friendly and helpful, as I needed directions to get to a particular shop in the city, which was less than 10 mins away by taxi.  Altogether, a good, decent hotel in the city.",3
5253,"The hotel reception/lobby is terrible. With such a grand building there’s no reason why it can’t be as amazing as the George V in Paris. How drab can you get. The rooms are great however. We had a 3 hour car tour with a Berlin guide recommended by the Hotel. This gentleman Lars was superb. 3 hours might seem a long time but he was 5 star.  When I got in the car I was worried I’d be bored, no chance it was brilliant. The hotel is good but not great.",4
5254,"While the hotel room and facilities and housekeeping were in line with the high LHW quality we expect, we were in disbelief about the poor customer service and management in this hotel:  We checked in around midnight after arriving from a delayed flight on December 29th. Understandably tired, both couples went directly to their rooms on separate floors. My boyfriend and I were on the 15th floor and his parents were on the 9th. When we called them to say goodnight, they explained that they had entered their assigned room with their electronic key card and found someone already in the room. The guest in the room had been roused from his sleep by their entry and had charged at them yelling, pushing the door and screaming. My boyfriend's parents were in shock (the bell hop had not…",2

5257,What a lovely hotel in the heart of Paris! Champs élysées just a short walk with beautiful streets and places to eat in between. Hotel was central yet quiet and the best value for money in the city. Will stay again ,5
5258,"Not advisable, better have standard room at the back of the hotel. Executive room on 3rd floor was very noisy (outside noise), plus an airco as if you are on the runway of an airport. Bathroom bit outdated. ",3
5259,"By reputation it should have been great. But! After I made my reservations,months in adavance, I called to request upper floor and adjoining rooms with my kids. It too a few calls. I was finally promised rooms on floor 32. Upon check in one room on 36 and one on 32. When insisted o joined rooms,we ended up on 12. I wonder what would happen if I only fulfilled have my commitment to Marriott?! House keeping was always late. Even after I called, check with front desk in person.  No use! Next time Hyatt!",1
5260,"Very convenient hotel to all sightseeing places. Priced right for Paris. Breakfast is great. The rooms have amenities you find at most high end hotels. A/C is cool, beds comfy. The garage across the street is convenient, tight fit for a station wagon but will still get in.",5
5261,"I had a lovely two nights at this hotel. When I first checked in, there was some miscommunication about online payment and registration but other than that, everything ran smoothly and the customer service was impeccable. The room was clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. The area is close to a train station just 20 mins on foot. I would come here again if possible. ",4
5262,"I have happily stayed in many Park Hyatts in Tokyo, Paris, Washington DC and New York. This one is entirely mediocre. It’s a shame because the Palacio itself is beautiful (I found the additon of modern leather sofas and leather paneling in the lobby area a bit sad against the gorgeous historic architecture of the Palacio). I found the location and service lackluster (confused staff, no one greeting arrivals at the Palacio side on a rainy day, an intense sign out process to borrow a cheap hotel umbrella which I have never experienced at a five stay hotel), and the room was totally mediocre and depressing in every way, might have been a nice Hilton Garden Inn. If you are looking for a boring and safe but luxurious Buenos Aires hotel in Recoleta I’d stay at the Four Seasons. If you…",2

Sad experience for our arrival in California after a long trip by plane and the tiredness...",1
5264,"Being a Mandarin, it is typically very pretty, great service, clean and very high end.  It is located in a great area, rooms are very nice and large for Europe, Breakfast isn't worth the price.  Rooftop bar is very nice, ""dipping"" pool is pretty but really should be a real pool instead of what it is.  View in the back of hotel isn't nice at all.  Service very good and food choices good as well.  Overall a very nice high end hotel but I would say a better business hotel rather than a "" vacation"" type hotel, but if you can afford it, it is very nice.",4
5265,The location is very convenient yet out of the tourist strip. Also easy to get to from direct from the airport on line U6.  While the comfort studio is relatively small its fine for a few days and does have a sink and convection microwave. (making the heat work is a challenge as hotel instructions are not clear)  Rooms are clean and relatively modern. An easy walk to Checkpoint Charlie and other tourists locations. Also there is a supermarket located just around the corner.,4
5266,"We stayed here in early Nov and the rooftop terrace was nice but chilly.  The poll is a small cold water pool which I would think would be great summer.  This hotel is within a couple of blocks of the Ramblas and very close to the market there. Nice place to stay, staff are helpful and friendly.  We had a room with breakfast that was included.  They have a great breakfast buffet.  We had a nicely laid out room that provided storage and the ability to easily get the luggage out of the way.",4
5267,"Nice large rooms ... but badly managed hotel and almost no one speaks any English. Calling Housekeeping we were unable to communicate that we wanted sachets of sugar and coffee in the room ... they didnt have a clue what those words meant.   Buffet breakfast the most chaotic and disorganized Ive ever seen - on 2 out of 3 days they ran out of food more than an hour before closing time. Most items had no labels or wrong labels - shudder to think what would happen to vegetarians and others with specific dietary preferences. And above all, miles away from anywhere you want to go   All in all ... if you dont speak Manadarin, or are part of a tour group that is managed by a leader .... just give this place a total miss.",2
5268,"We arrived only a few days after their official public launch of this new hotel. Everything was beautifully presented across the entire hotel. The hotel staff were simply incredible and very helpful with local advice, baggage, drinks and food. The room was very well decorated and extremely comfortable with wonderful views over the Square below. I went with my son (14) who has travelled extensively across the globe, however, the staff here made him want to return to Berlin again very soon.",5
5269,"We have just come back from a stay at the Regent Berlin.  We picked this hotel because of its location and the fact that it was also very close to one of the magnificent Christmas Markets that are in Berlin.  As soon as we pulled up in a taxi it looked so festive and once we walked in we were greeted by lovely Christmas scents and a soothing piano being played in the foyer.  This hotel is grand and the reception is impressive.  The rooms are lovely, especially the bathroom.  The only trouble with the room was that i found the pillows too hard, but that's just personal preference.  There was coffee making facilities, bathrobes and slippers, little bag of handmade biscuits and a selection of fruit.  We were unable to eat in the restaurant as for some reason it is closed Sunday and…",5
5270,"Unfortunately our stay at the Mecure on Therry street, Melbourne was not a pleasant experience. From first contact, when we were initially enquiring and corresponding with the staff at the hotel regarding our stay they were impatient and difficult to talk to over the phone.  When arriving to the hotel for our stay, the gentlemen behind the desk was helpful and informative, unfortunately this was the only pleasant customer service we received. Travelling with a sibling when booking we requested single beds, this was overseen and obviously too difficult for the team at reception to take the initiative and provide a solution for us, we were told impatiently when we phoned reception from our room that ""we are over booked and there is nothing we can do"". Nothing you can do? I doubt…",2

The position is excellent: close to major venues, 2 minute walk to the train station, Berlin Zoo across the street, bus just as close, less than 30 minutes from the airport (Tegel).The rooms are well serviced and the staff are very helpful in so many ways. The restaurant is just fine and the wine/beer choices are good. We would definitely return to Berlin and would stay here again. Great visit!!",4
5272,Our stay was gifted to us for my birthday.  Checking in was a smooth process.  We left our luggage and headed off to see Harry Potter so didn’t have time to check the room over. Returned after Harry Potter at 10:30pm to go straight to bed.  1. Heater was so noisey we thought a alarm was going off in the halls (heater above door) So we turned it back off and slept in a cold room.  2. Shower was horrendous.  Got up in the morning to a mouldy shower.  It’s obviously mouldy because the fan doesn’t work in the bathroom.   3. The View would have been amazing but the window was covered in dripping condensation from the shower.   4. Room was musty and we couldn’t wait to check out.  5. Told reception soon leaving the room was mouldy and fans and and heater not working.  They didn’t…,2

They even made the following comment: “Don’t worry the bigger rooms are too big for a couple, yours is very cosy and nicer”. •	Room: Great room (+++), but only a few face the beach, some of them are right next to the car parking, (of course of ours), try to avoid them    •	All spa treatments included in the rate: Small print here, only 2 treatments per person are day guaranteed....but even for the 2 you have to book in advance and be very persistent at the reception.

5275,We had five nights at these hotel apartments. It was fantastic to find an apartment option that included a wheelchair accessible choice. We utilised the kitchenette to self-cater for breakfast as there is a fridge and microwave as well as cutlery and dinnerware. We utilised the Lidl in the next street for food (it opens early) but we also used the bakery as it opens earlier. I am in a wheelchair and we found the location to be exceptional. The wheelchair accessible room is well set out. There is complimentary wi-fi.,4
5276,"The service at this hotel was extremely horrible, they are very rude and unhelpful, everyone had attitudes and this is not the way I planned to be for my birthday. It was as if my money didn't matter seeing as I was local. I will never come here again. ",1
5277,"The location is very good, right near tge Leidplein main square but in the ""quiet"" side inside the side street however that doesn't help the fact that the acoustic in the hotel is terrible and you can hear everything that's happenning outside your room and door so the sleeping quality is poor.  The free WiFi is stable but very very slow.  The bathroom is OK but the water pressure is poor and in fact need a repair and a better maintenance.  The housekeeping is really poor, the room is not so clean and they didn't ever renew the shower and body soap.  The staff at the reception are not really helpfull not friendly which is a shame.  I would say it's a normal 3 stars hotel but have a lot to improve and for the same money I would suggest going somewhere else.",3

Last day nothing seems to work right from simple request for coffee capsules to turn down service and very slow response to internal hotel sms service. rooms design is adorable but also here whatever looks amazing on the web site is not so in reality. I use my Marriott SNA for upgrade to a suite. Got room 1407 spread over two floors- sounds amazing until you realized that the bedroom on top floor is small, shower is tiny and literally next to the bed. No windows at the bedroom ( only skylight) and living room with very high window and the little you can see if you really try hard is next door…",3

The hotel is in a good location and the room was comfortable. It didn't exactly feel as luxurious as advertised but it was definitely nice. However, I booked the hotel through a 3rd party and prepaid for the room. Upon check-in I was asked for a credit card and I was hesitant and I explained I already paid and feared being charged twice. The receptionist checked and saw I had paid, but needed the card for incidentals, fair enough.

However, what we thought was a great deal in a prime location took a turn for the worst. The second morning we were there I found a live bug, almost like a little worm, in my bed. I killed it then began getting ready for the day. When using a lint brush on my black dress, I found another and my cousin found a dead one embedded in a brand new towel. At this point we were alarmed so we brought the lint brush to the front desk and requested that Cristian Mena come to our room. We were advised that they were termites. We requested another room and moved that same day. While moving, one of my cousins ran back…",1

When we first arrived at the hotel, the room was dirty (dust on remote control, underneath the sink) and the fridge was not working (it was barely on). We called the front desk straight away and they said because it's late at night, they will send someone up tomorrow morning.  Next morning before we left the hotel, we called the front desk to remind them to clean the room THOROUGHLY. When we came back, they took no action on our requests.

I've stayed in other three star hotels in the area and this one is, by far, the best.",5

The trainstation is also nearby, so it's very easy to arrive from the airport and visit for example Nice or Monaco.  The staff was always very friendly and helpful, we really felt warmly welcomed to stay at Le Cavendish. Our superior room was big enough and had a balcony, the air conditioning was effective and quiet and the rooms are well noise isolated.  Breakfast is very good offering also gluten free products by request.  We enjoyed our stay and could focus on our holiday without problems. Only minor issue was the slow wifi, that also lost connection every now and then.",5

The room was very clean and comfortable.  The bathroom was almost open plan with the bedroom, the shower cubicle was quite interesting - bit like standing in a glass display case!  The breakfast buffet had lots of choice and was always well stocked.  Although there is not tea and coffee facilities in the room, this was not a problem.  In the reception you could make drinks to take up to your room or you could sit in the bar area for a change of scene.  Handy bakery just next door too. Superb free wifi and computers available to use in reception too.  Great value for money- would stay here again.",5

I don't know if this is related to the outdated concept of having carpet floors in the room or that these filthy carpet floors are approximately 30 years old or the combination with the perfume they apply to cover up for the sometimes noticeable cigarette smell (smoking is obviously inofficially welcome in the non-smoking hotel). The smell is bearable with 24 h open windows, could prove difficult if the weather is hot. Cracks in the walls are refilled but not repainted, 2 door handles fell off,in the bathroom the seams of the tiles are often black from fungus. As an exchange for this obvious…",2

5292,Spent 3 days at this hotel and it was a disappointing decision. The hotel is close to the city centre and located on a very busy roundabout. The hotel is of modern design but is in poor condition. The rooms are well appointed however the walls are thin and there is only wooden panel slats as flooring including the hallways which elevates the noise of people talking and or rolling the suitcases along the floor.  Without advising on their website the hotel swimming pool was not in service. The sauna and steam room are very good.  The staff at this hotel speak very little English and this is problematic.

The hotel is simply a very cheap renovation of an old hotel with a few pieces of smart furniture in the common rooms.

5309,Very poor lighting in the toilet area and poor in room.  Staff was very nice.  Didn't research location before hand and it could have been better. Mostly it was an average experience. IF we were to return to Lisbon I would select another hotel,3
5310,"This hotel is lovely! The staff is welcoming, efficient, and helpful, the room although small, was tastefully decorated, comfortable, and very clean, and the neighborhood is convenient to many sights, shopping, and public transportation. I’m looking forward to a return visit!",5
5311,Great budget design hotel in Berlin that is also a perfect location if you need to have a working / meeting area with his lounge lobby café and cool and friendly staff. All details perfectly taken care of.. i wish more budget hotels would take this hotel as an example. It also has a parking area so perfect for film production teams looking for a convenient area to stay.,5
5312,I can only agree with the other reviews. Close to airport. Nice rooms. Excellent staff. Good breakfast. Nothing too much trouble. Do not use holiday inn anywhere else but always use this one. Easy access to City although getting metro tickets can be hard as many machines do not work. Use Taxi.,4
5313,"We absolutely loved our time in Cannes, and we believe it was because of the excellent stay at Le Grand. From the food, to the amenities, to the beach, it was all wonderful. We can't thank Le Grand enough for such an amazing stay.",5
5314,The Hotel is perfectly located to escape from Lisbon by car or walk up and down into the city center of Lisbon. Good breakfast and friendly service. Standard room is not big and watch out for the space you need before booking. Do not expect any upgrade in high season. No pool nor other special treats. It is indeed a very good city hotel in the largest and elegant avenida of Lisbon.,3
5315,Dirty room and filthy bathroom. No view but super noisy. Expensive. Limited food options. Everyone in my party got an upgrade except me. Could have gotten the same level of service for $100 per night instead of $400.,1
5316,"Sneaky and dishonest hotel. My friend and I stayed there for a conference, and we both are very disappointed. First, they refused to give us enough of their ""complimentary"" breakfast cards. The receptionist apparently thought that only one person should eat breakfast and the other what, watch them? Unclear. Fine, her colleague was able to solve it.  Then at the check-out they demanded a $29 amenity fee even though there was a booking confirmation with a total sum. Finally, three days after we leave, they charge my credit card with a mini-bar purchase which neither of us made. When I called and confronted them - and I had to call twice because they promised to call me back and never did, of course, why would they? - the receptionist simply said, oh, let me reverse that. As simple…",1
5317,An excellent stop over for our road trip around the Cote d' azur. The check in was really efficient and the reception guy provided a lovely service. (sorry I can not remember is name Patrice i think) The room was really clean and with a view over the sea made it even more special. Breakfast was a bit of a disapointment though at 20 euros per person it was very steep for some cereals and orange juice. An easy access accross a little bridge to the beach and if you don't fancy the beach the Hotel swimming pool is very comfortable. All in all a great experience and I would definately recomend to friends and family. Thank you ,5
5318,"I booked this hotel because of very high rate, despite price. For normal price you get very clean room (day cleaned with fresh towels). Best thing is that the nearest metro is 50m from the hotel. I also recommend buffet breakfast with big offer (10€/person). ",5
5319,"There were lots of electricity cuts during our stay. During the night this let to the tv switching on (""welcome"" page) after the power came back although we switched the tv off before going to bed. There was no sound, but still the tv was bright enough to continously wake us up.  ",3
5320,"Good location but low end , very basic hotel, poor service, ugly decoration, room with a terrible noise from Time to time (something like a generator) , expectations from Hyatt are higher ; better to go somewhere else as one has a wide choice in San Francisco.",1
5321,"Stayed 3 nights and each night was pretty awful. The walls are so thin that you can literally hear conversations 2-3 rooms in any direction. Factor that it is a low cost hotel and you get a noisy crowd of 20-somethings at all hours. If the hotel had normal walls, it'd be no problem, but it sounds as if you're thrown into the discussions whether you like it or not. I saw the other reviews saying the same, yet I didn't fully appreciate just how thin the walls really are. It's worse than you're imagining, trust me. Rooms are 2 star quality at best. Dingy, dated carpet and overall dirty feeling. Feels like a budget motel you'd find in the bowels of Orlando. Friendly service but, if you value sleep (when you want it) and/or privacy, then move on. You've been warned.",1
5322,"The usual Ibis Styles quality.  I appreciated the cleanliness of the rooms, the attitude of the staff. the included buffet breakfast, the proximity to the Metro, the number of power points, the excellent free wi-fi.

5324,"Crowne Plaza Berlin City is right at the heart of the city moments away from shopping and just off Berlin Zoo. It is a 20 minute drive from the airport, TXL, which is about €20 in a taxi. The hotel is nice and on a quiet street. The rooms are modern and well planned and all rooms have saved and coffee and tea making facilities. The bathrooms are small but well planned. They have a decent sized gym and a good pool. The restaurant and bars are good and reasonable priced. Overall a good hotel right at the city centre. ",4
5325,A very beautiful apartment in a good neighborhood.You can walk to the beach in 15 minutes and the nearest metro is around 2 minutes walk. We stayed there with 5 adults and we had enough space. If I go to barcelona again I would book that apartment again.,4
5326,"My wife was on crutches having just had knee surgery. She was concerned about traveling but it was my best friends son's wedding so she decided to be a trooper. When we got to the hotel we were told the were overbooked and our reservation would not be honored. We had booked a suite but were offered a standard room at the Marriott. This despite confirming the reservation in August and the grooms mother confirming it Thursday. This was a problem because she needed to get off her feet and so I asked to speak to  a manager. I was met with nothing but hostility and discourtesy from the manager,Madison Sullivan. She was horrible and has no business being in the hospitality industry! The Marriott was not a property we were willing to stay at and we had to make other arrangements.…",1
5327,"I concur with a lot of what's been already written. This place is fun, relaxed and very stylish. It is good value and perfect for a weekend stay.  It gets marked down because they were unable to provide an ironing board within two hours of me asking. The reason given was that it was a busy Saturday and they were all in use by other guests. They weren't willing to retrieve one from a room because they didn't know who they had given them to.  Whatever their excuse, a decent hotel being unable to provide an ironing board is ridiculous and reveals a certain incompetence somewhere along the line.  Sort it out guys.",3

I selected this hotel to stay because my friends from Sri Lankan Airlines also stay in the hotel and its closer to the shopping district and connections.  I was asked to be careful of the street touts and so did I. But inside the hotel, passing the lobby a tout acted as if he owns the ""Silk Shop"" and ran away with 300 RMB. The lady in the shop said he told me he was my friend. I said he was using your calulator and showing me prices and negotiating and thats why I gave him the money.  Anyways when I complained to the Duty Manager he was like "" you were cheated by a street tout and please complain to the police"". I asked him if my baggaewas stolen from the hotel by…",2
5330,"Nice little place even though I was not entirely taken. The ""writers"" theme looks a bit fake in terms of decor but it's a question of taste.  Small hotel, very near the Cadet metro station and plenty of restaurants around. My room was neither small nor large. Fake parquet flooring (better than carpet), comfortable bed and no noise either from outside or from the corridor.   Not enough shower gel/shampoo and really hot room were the main drawbacks. I had to sleep with the window open on the first 2 nights. Things got better the following 2 ones. Short on storage too.  Breakfast is good and plentiful. But why keep hard boiled eggs so hot that they can't be held?  Friendly staff.  I'd go back.",5
5331,"Stayed here for 3 nights with my partner in feb 17.  The hotel is lovely, very clean, staff very friendly and helpful. We arrived early morning 10am, check in is usually 3pm, the reception staff were happy to take our cases give us directions to local place for breakfast, a useful map of city pointing out our position and local places of interest.  They also had our room ready early so we could unpack. The room itself very nice, as other have said water and beer in fridge, kettle, hairdryer, shower gel etc, no iron but there is a trouser press.  Room lovely and warm as it was freezing outside, beds comfortable, we asked for extra pillows and it was no problem, my partner forgot his razor, reception staff gave him one.   The bar area is in the lobby and has some lovely cocktails.…",4

5333,"The hostel has amazing dorms, some of the best I've stayed in, and the pool is amazing to sit around and socialize.  The bar, oh the bar... Looks amazing, actually one of the worst I've been to, its like they see it solely as a money making machine, the drinks are incredibly weak and over priced. They are very inflexible with the drinks and the food in general. The bar staff however were lovely. The reception staff not so much... All in all its a nice place to stay if you just want to chill out, but if you want to party, you'll need a fat wallet.",2
5334,"The location of St. Christopher's is the real draw - it's a five minute walk from Centraal Station - right in the heart of the RLD. The bar and lounge downstairs are a good starting spot for pub crawls. The accommodations were standard - nothing special, but the beds were comfortable and the rooms were clean. The only place I stayed at on this trip which offered free breakfast (which was pretty decent) so as far as value for money goes, you won't get much better with anything in this area.",3
5335,"Right at the ipanema boulevard we stayed in this hotel. The hotel looks a bit run down and is old. The windows are not isolated so you wake early from the traffic noise. Bathrooms are small, shower is excellent.Breakfast also ok, the mini pool on the roff offers nice sights, rooms are long but narrow with two enormous beds in it. Due to plastic? Under the matrasses the beds are hot and sweaty. Airco works like a charm. Next time I would book in copacabano or leblon when in rio",2
5336,"The building is beautiful but to claim this is a 5 star hotel is silly. Too many things malfunction and service is very average, if not below average.  First thing we noticed when we arrived at night was the fact that the heating unit did not seem to work. We thought maybe there's a delay and went to sleep but the room was cold all night. The following day we contacted the staff and told them about the issue. A man came to our room trying to convince us there's nothing wrong and that there's a delay but we told we turned the heating to the max the previous day and they finally believed us and brought heaters to the room.  Another aggravating experience was using the room service. My wife is vegan and sadly, this restaurant doesn't offer any vegan meals. We called the room…",3

We checked in around 4pm, dropped our luggage and headed out immediately. Upon return to the room (9:15pm) we realized that the room had not been cleaned! There was hair all over the bathroom floor (clearly from multiple different people, so who knows when the bathroom had actually been cleaned) sticky rings on the nightstand from glasses that had been sitting, a dead spider that had obviously been smashed on the ceiling, spider webs hanging from the ceiling, smeared finger prints and marks near numerous light switches and electrical outlets, carpet had not been vacuumed and food still in the refrigerator from the previous guest. We…",1

Beds were hard as a rock. We woke up with sore backs every morning. When we complained about it, the staff was not very helpfull. I would not recommand this hotel. ",2
5341,I called to make a reservation for two rooms.  I was quoted the same rate for both of them but when I got the confirmation emails one of them was much higher.  I called back and was told to take it or leave it.   To quote one price and then bill a higher price is simply unacceptable.,1
5342,"3 years ago I gave you the same feedback... When connecting my phone to the hotel wifi, it only last for 1 minute, absolutely annoying.  Please do something. I also recommended to provide your guests with earplug, last time it was because of political demonstrations, this time Av Paulista is going under repairs at night.",2
5343,"As a young couple just turned 60 we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. All the staff were very young and accommodating. The room was spacious and funky, especially the shower....say no more!  Only two little grizzles. Number one, there is no reading light above the giant bed on one side. It meant I had to squash over to the other side of the bed to read at night. We had requested a quiet room and being placed on the first floor was very noisy as loads of young people gathered outside to chat. Overall we had a fantastic time and made new friends around the pool and especially at the Happy Hour cocktail classes. Loads of fun and frolicking!  Would most definitely return. Good services and an interesting location bordering onto the Gothic area.",4
5344,What a HOLE. The service stinks and so do the rooms. I recommend sleeping in your car. ,1

We booked this hotel and were super excited. Visiting Chicago for the first time ever. When we booked it said River view and contential breakfast! Neither were given to us. And when I asked they were so rude and said no. On top of that when we asked good places to eat they sent us to the crappiest places! Both times! Anyways! Don’t waste your time! Horrible!",1

However, here are some aspects they should improve on if they have to be rated 5 star. I would not be seeing these as issues if the hotel was listed with fewer stars and was less expensive.  1. Room was not made up till late afternoon.  2. Staff gave conflicting information about whether the metal window screen can be opened and closed using the button available in the room. In the end, I was told it had to be manually moved if I requested but I prefer to have the control over the button. 3. They had a power outage one day which I was informed of in advance. But they lost internet and tv access for the next 10-12 hours after power was restored. I would have thought they…",3

However, the hostel is quite far from the main town of Fira (30 min walk away, or taxis which are quite expensive). We ended up renting an ATV which made things a lot easier to get around. Additionally, we weren't terribly impressed with the customer service with several small issues, such as forgetting laying out linens for our pre-scheduled late night arrival, having limited food at breakfast (not complaining about options, but mere quantity), and not being very helpful or enthusiastic when asked for sightseeing advice or recommendations. This wasn't a terrible hostel and we certainly had a pleasant enough stay,…",3

Yes they had hammering going on at night(last I looked at the clock it was after11 PM). When I called the desk they said they where working on the lobby yes at night and past 11 PM. AT check are diver could not pull into there lot. We got no help from the bell staff to carry are things in from the street. Also don't go for there up grade room. Are bedroom wall was the wall to the elevator. No need to count sheep you can count the trips the elevator makes. All night long. It was are first and last time to stay here. Lots of better places to stay in the city. But do go 1 time for drinks at The Top of The Mark. The views are great.",1
5349,"During a recent stay at the hotel, we had a very unpleasant experience with our room and the management staff.   The hotel management handled our complaint with a unhygienic, inhabitable room issue with lack of expected concern or consideration.   They did not take our complaint seriously nor were they willing to compensate us for having to check out immediately.   I would not refer friends, family or colleagues to stay at this hotel. And this poor experience, ruined a very celebrated weekend in San Francisco.",1
5350,"We spent 3 nights here and everything was ok. Spacy room, clean, good bed, nice bathroom. Even if hotel is next to a big road, it was quiet inside (room 406). Staff was kind and willing to help. A lot of breakfast options, both sweet and salty, gluten-free bread was ok but no other gluten-free and dairy-free products except for soya milk. It took a little bit longer when you order bacon or eggs.  There are two drawbacks - only ""sliding"" glass door to bathroom means almost no privacy. Also shared toillets next to restaurant have very similar design. Really not smart.  - very small number of hangers (but we did not ask for more so I don't know if there is chance to get more of them)  Hotel is next to several famous places such us Casa Batllo and it is 10min by walk to the Gothic…",4

However, the rooms in the hotel are tired. We had several problems, such as the safe not working when we first went to our room and poor lighting to read in bed. The rooms are definitely tired and in need of a serious make over. The staff is friendy, though unevenly efficient",3

The spacious rooms are very clean, modern and foreseen with all the little amenities a business traveller appreciates: a nice size bathroom with a good working shower; Free and good working WiFi, that also allows VPN connections without one having to upgrade to a costly “Premium Service”; a big bottle of water and a modern TV.  The Bar was adequate, with a better than average selection of drinks and the Restaurant was absolutely fine, serving some nice fresh cousins.

We were told that we would be led to our room by a staff member because it was a bit hard to find. Yes, it’s true, we wouldn’t have figured out on our own how to navigate our way via an elevator to the second floor, then through a stairwell into a parking garage, and then into an adjacent building (where our guide warned us not to take that second building’s elevator down because we’d “never get back up”). I’m honestly shocked that any hotel would find it acceptable to locate some of their rooms in a building that guests can only access through a garage. We never saw another human in that garage, and it may have been…",2

Lots of polished glass & chrome, very clean, almost clinical. The staff were very friendly & helpful although the reception staff could have been a bit friendlier on arrival particularly.

The hotel is very close to “Nation” and “Picpus” metro stations which is very convenient. There are many grocery stores and restaurants in this area. It is fairly residential so not touristy at all. The staff are very helpful and there is a nice breakfast. I will likely stay here again sometime.,5

The woman at the front desk was not apologetic at all, had a bad attitude and actually stated, ""It's one of our biggest rooms so it takes the longest to clean.""  It was almost as if the room had grown overnight and there was no way they could possibly plan for it to be ready on time!  When I asked how I would be compensated for the room not being ready somehow a room magically appeared.  There was hair in the bathroom.  Only one elevator worked so after waiting 10+ minutes two times (we were only there one night...) we had to take the stairs.  I will never stay here again.",1

We had a superior room and I found it very small and a bit worn, the bathroom especially was a bit shabby with the floor of the shower flaking away. Breakfast is good, the roof terrace is a really nice place to sit and have a sundowner and the location is very convenient for sightseeing. I just think if you are paying ~€300 per night for a room it needs to be significantly more luxurious! And the hotel needs to be more impressive. Sorry to say it because I liked the place and if it was priced more appropriately, my rating would have been a lot better.",3

We walked everywhere when we weren't using the hop on - hop off bus which is always great to get a feel for a new destination. We had an executive room which also gave us access to the lounge which was one of the best Hilton exec lounges we've used. We had breakfast in the lounge and there was always good choice. Afternoon cakes were delicious and evening drinks good as well. The room was a standard fairly small one with a small bathroom but ok for us as we weren't in the room much.

5379,"I have a love hate relationship with the hotel.   The Jazz bar and views are really good. The view is amongst the best I've experienced in Shanghai.  I absolutely hated the room, not only are the rooms tired, they lack co-ordination, like they have tried to update elements of the room and not thought through the overall appeal to consumers e.g. the glass panelled bathroom is grey and a tad dirty looking, the rest of the room an old looking brown.   I also hate the getting to the room. Lift, change lift, lift change lift, lift change lift and on and on day after day.   Checking in was smooth, getting food was not. On arrival the reception staff said the restaurant was open and I could eat there. The restaurant offered me left over soup, refused to serve another else and then…",2

But paying just shy of £3k for a weeks stay, and getting a room that can be found in any premier inn in the UK for that prices with a faulty toilet, daily leaking air conditioning and broken balcony doors, i really cant excuse that and i'm a tolerable person.  The top floor pool and bar are brilliant for views you wont get a much better place to see coppacabana beach day or night, but the poorly lined pool and sub par food make it hard to want to stay. Saying this a couple of the bar staff up there where so great and funny, having good banter teaching us Portuguese. This can not be said for the staff…",2

The website is nothing like reality !  $700 a night, to stay in a hotel in dire need of renovation .... in a room where the front door hits the bed-side table when you open it ....in a room described as ""sea view"" but where you can only see the sea if you crane your neck and squint.  A chat with the bellhop reveals that the hotel is under new management and apparently they've been waiting for some renovation investment .... and are still waiting.",1

One of two rooms with a terrace, which was an absolute god send for some tranquil peace after a long day in the city, before heading off for our evenings out, absolute bliss!!   The hotel is located near so many great restaurants, bars and also well stocked supermarkets. There is also a Farmers Market around the corner on Tuesdays and Thursdays, which was huge and great fun to check out all the bits!  The staff couldn't be more helpful. They found us more coat hangers, got my fiancée a vase for the flowers I bought her, printed our tickets to the Louvre, ordered us taxis and informed us of places to go, shop, eat.

Also it was hard to drive up to, (once you found it, it was fine)  The clerk we dealt with was a little unhelpful in the concierge duties as we were very confused as to how to take a boat tour.  If I had to give it any bonus; it is connected to a nice food area sort of like the ones in Seattle or San Francisco.",3

We love this hotel, it's very clean, updated modern interior and lovely view of the Eiffel from the balcony! quiet neighborhood and I enjoyed being able to observe regular Parisians going about their daily lives. A boulangerie is right next door, also a Japanese restaurant and a few different restaurants nearby. Carrefour city very close as well. Laundry 2 blocks away. Literally a 5 minutes walk to the Vaugirard metro station. Very ideal location. Staff are friendly. Fast wifi. Will definitely be back the next time we're in Paris again.",5

If you just want somewhere basic, clean and cheap to lay your head at night this hotel is ideal. No frills, the rooms are very small and basic. There is free WiFi, The hotel employees in my experience are all polite and speak some level of English so communication isn't a problem. Breakfast are excellent - lots of choice and all you can eat and drink. The location is well placed for getting round the city by bus and metro.

However it is really let down by the following, I will mention the things we didn't like.  1) we went to the hotel restaurant for dinner one night and although there were signs in the lift saying they offer a buffet, we were told they didn't offer buffet that night or the next and not for a while apparently. We still stayed and were disappointed with the dinner. My vegetable soup was luke warm and bland. We also ordered what the menu described as ""bread basket with a selection of butters and olive oil"" well our bread basket didn't come and when we asked about it, they brought us each one small dinner roll which was stale and a plate with about 5gm butter and 5gm olive oil. Very disappointing food. 2) I ordered…",3

It’s a short taxi ride or 30 min walk to Brandenburg gate, Potsdamer Platz.  In all a pretty good stay.",4

Ha! I asked for a coffee-maker and they brought just a kettle, without a cup and without a coffee sachet - WiFi although at 10 Euros, is very bad and only the cable works -  I asked for someone to come an help me for a withdrawal in the bank next door (since everything is in Spanish) and they denied - It takes 2-3 minutes to get a warm water The only nice thing in the hotel is the old man who serves the breakfast, gentle and warm.",2

The extra blanket was waffle knit and rough- the only 'blanket' on the bed are two sheets with a thin, dirty down thing inbetween.  It was the worst 3 nights I've had in a hotel, I travel frequently and will never stay at another hyatt hotel. The customer service was nonexistent,  the staff acted robotic...they smiled and said 'sorry you didnt have a good stay'. Not very welcoming or comfortable hotel.",1

The hotel premises are not that nice, very basic, breakfast is ok, but do not except too much. At this price I would recommend a ""Home stay"" option.   We spend 6 nights in Hue and it is way too much, 2 full days would have been enough.",2

Although assured of full payment before checkout, and although the applicable credit card payment for that assurance had been made and was in the process of clearing, with full knowledge of that, the hotel management chose to lock my wife, with a broken leg and fractured ankle, out of the room for over two hours without notifying me so I could provide proof of sufficient credit, which I immediately did when I returned to the room and found out what had happened.

The building is very grand and architecturally impressive but, somehow, the hotel feels a bit cheerless inside, and could perhaps do with a little freshening up.  My first impression on arriving was the semi-unpleasant smell (a bit like the aroma of sour milk...?) that permeated the small lobby, and the corridors.  The smell seemed to dissipate as we got closer to our room, thankfully.  The room itself - a corner room - was an excellent size, with very high ceilings, and two large windows, letting in lots of light.  We had plenty of space, although the bathroom felt a bit on the small side and, to be honest, for a 5-star hotel, the bath/shower combo was a bit…",3

I returned to my room at 11:00 pm and heard the water refilling the toilet tank.  The rubber stopper did not fit securely in the tank.  I was able to make an adjustment and the frequency of tank refilling slowed.  It seemed to me that someone previously tried to fix this toilet because I saw a weight sitting on top of the rubber flapper.    I didn’t call the front desk and ask for a new room because I was tired and I didn’t want to go through the inconvenience of switching rooms.

A block from the Place des Vosges and near Rue St Antoine, Bastille, and the best of the Marais, there is possibly no better choice for a well-located charming Parisian hotel with terrific value for money.  Though the rooms are not large, they're perfectly suitable for a brief stay for two or several rooms for groups travelling together.  Friendly staff, clean, comfortable rooms.  Some may find the dimensions a little tight but this is Paris, and somewhat expected.  Would absolutely stay again or recommend to others.  Bravo!",5

5440,"Check in was smooth, I arrived early and the room was already ready. Location was good as the U bahn station is literally a few steps away and then it's a short commute to the centre.   The room was very clean and it contained every appliance that you would need for a short stay. The kitchen was well equipped. One thing I did notice was that there were some dirty dishes left in the dishwasher which I wasn't too happy about. Otherwise everything else was super clean.  The wifi was free but the signal was not very strong. It was sometimes a struggle to get online.  The bathroom facility was good, the shower had good water pressure. One thing to note is that in some of the apartments the showers are open and not in a separate room.",4

As requested , we got interconnecting rooms on a higher floor , and they were quite comfortable for our short stay. The best part is that the location of the hotel is perfect for tourists.  I would have to add that the wonderful lady ( I wish we knew her name ) at the front desk , who did both our check-in & check-out , was one of the MOST COURTEOUS & AFFABLE hotel employees we have ever come across in our lives. Thanks to her , we knew which places to visit & shop at , before the national holiday on 3rd October. I hope the management is able to check their records , and thank the mentioned employee on our behalf.  Would gladly stay here again !!",4

Ok, that can can happen, but the girl on the desk wasn't helpful at all, we asked for another room, if we can have a second bed (even for a charge), but she ""couldn't"" do anything she told. All we got offered was another blanket. Not what I expect from a 4-Star Hotel at all, this is more bad 2-star service. But later this evening we checked on the booking platform again, and surprise: the same hotel had still rooms available - with two separate beds! Even cheaper and better than we have booked. So we booked another room, because sleeping in the same small double bed wasn't an option for us two…",3

The position for us was fantastic but quite a way out of Funchal, the busses were very easy to get though. It’s a quite area with lovely views and promenade walk but not town direction. Breakfast was very average. Sausages too spiced for breakfast and bacon was cooked on mass, never separated so some burnt some just fat. Orange juice was not nice and croissants too heavy and doughy with a strange glase. Did not try evening meals because of this - they could be very good though Non of the above spoilt our holiday and…",3

The bathroom was small and the double bed was not comfortable. The wi-fi connection was terrible in the room and there was no signal in the room for the cell phone. The maid was waiting outside the room to clean it and we were sort of forced to leave before 11.00 am so that she could clean. The swimming pool was very small and the owner was yelling at the kids when they used the pool. I wouldn't recommend this place.",3

It bothered me that I had ordered late check out at 5pm and that had been agreed on via email, but when we arrived that was no longer available. I did not feel that the staff was sorry about this. This made our last day difficult since we didn't have a flight until the evening. I just can't recommend this hotel.  I would expect much more from a 4 star hotel.",3
5452,Two things instantly come to mind about this place. It is really cheap and it is right beside underground station. These two things are really useful. We had one room for three nights. The room having two sets of bunk beds and a double bed meaning six people could fit in this room. Although a small room for six people it is quite alright when considering the price per person per night. The room even had a separate toilet and shower room. Whilst six people could sleep here the table in the room doesn’t fit six people unfortunately as there really isn’t enough space to put in a table this large. Having a top bunk I must say how impressed I was with little things such as a small light and power ports only I could access. This definitely was a major convenience. On the first floor…,4

The rooms are very clean and the bathrooms are lovely and really modern. The rooms aren’t huge but plenty big enough for what you need. It was certainly very quiet and we enjoyed the breakfast, which was quite a range. The staff were pleasant and in comparison to other hotels in Barcelona I do feel we got value for money. ",4

Louder then being on the train...and I have to try and somehow piece together a few hours of sleep before waking up at 6:30 am for an all day conference.  I get my poor timing.  I booked during the largest restaurant convention happening in the world so rooms are hard to come by.

However the room was exactly what we needed as a base, plenty of tv channels, clean, tidy and a comfy bed. The location is slightly out of the way from Lisbon centre but only a short metro ride away. There's a nearby shopping centre too which was handy. Not bad for the price you pay.",3

Also the food is not good, very basic, particularly for lunch. They are specialized in burgers, salads, bagels, pasta...not very authentic and the food is not very qualitative.  For breakfast you have a buffet with lots of different food (salad fruits, cereals, eggs, ham, croissants, cakes...) but once again the food is not qualitative",3

I spoke to the man at the front desk who also took my cell and said he would call or text me. I then had to  stop in AGAIN the next day, as no one had responded to either my call or visit. The same man was behind the desk. When I told him no one else had contacted me at all, he said, ""Oh, well they did not find your things."" How the heck am I supposed to know this with no one returning my call or following up with me?  Not to mention there is an issue with…",1
5506,Old and grotty and the room is so small.  I guess we should complain and maybe we would get something better but looking at the inside of the place I doubt it. Only have 3 more nights. Just shows trip advisor isn't much of an indicator as the reviews seemed OK,1
5507,"Studio had lots of space, working windows & furnace fan allowed us to air out the place - we found the bldg to have a weird smell & would have left immediately if the room could have been cancelled - they required full payment in advance. Vintage 1980's? microwave was indicative of the place, outdated countertops, etc.  No ice machine in this bldg (adjacent bldg had ice). Couch could be 25 yrs old. Bed was quite nice. Front desk staff explained $22 resort fee - pool towels, exercise room, newspaper... then reluctantly gave us the morning paper (already nearly 7pm). Sunday morning they would not give a newspaper - because I didn't order one. I asked why this pre-order wasn't explained together with the resort fee & received only an apology and directions to a market where I could…",2
5508,"Having stayed in many luxury chains including Peninsula, Ritz, St Regis and Shangri-La I find Intercontinental Lisbon should not be marketed as a luxury hotel. It should be marketed as a budget luxury.   First of all, the bathroom are not marbel and I’m sure it’s titles. Even if they were marbles they must be very cheap kind. Please refrain selling your rooms as marbel bathroom in your marketing materials because they are not.   The hotel only give one water bottle per day for two people and chargers for any additional. I find this is okay if it’s a £70 room but when you pay close to £220 a night you would expected to be able to have more than one complementary water bottle. At least the other hotels I’ve stayed gives unlimited water bottles.   Then to terrible breakfast. The…",3

When it comes to food, the portions are big but it just doesn’t taste anything that falls in an edible range. I had nei Meen fry which didn’t have much flavour. The fish in mango gravy- the gravy was edible but the fish was bland. The prawns varuval, the flavours weren’t in the prawns at all. My entire hope of having a yummy Kerala lunch went for a toss. ",2
5510,"We landed to this hotel after uselessly searching a place to stay in the city centre. Everything was fully booked, owing to the peak season and the finale of the Supertaça coming in a couple of days, so we decided to check in the Marina area and we found a room at this hotel.  The personnel at the reception couldn't possibly be kinder and more helpful and the hotel is conveniently located nearby the bridge that connects the Marina to the city centre on one side and the beaches on the other side.   However, for the price they charge (120,00 € per night, double room, treatment B&B), a couple of things could be improved. For example, they could put shelf or something like that in the bathroom (there's nothing to put your toiletries on, apart from the very narrow plastic shelf…",3
5511,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our short stay.  Decorated for the holidays, the property is beautiful.  The staff was exceptional,  assisting us in obtaining transportation in the wake of a transit strike.  Also the dining, starting with an evening reception, room service. and a buffet breakfast was outstanding and reasonably priced.  All and all a great experience. ",5
5512,"We stayed at the Eden Opera Hotel beginning August 11, party of 6.  The hotel staff was incredible accommodating. The hotel receptionist (a female, long curly hair) was exceptionally kind. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.  It is walking distance (0.3 miles) to the Montmartre District with lots of shops and cafes.  Real gem.  We found the best macaroons in the area at Paul's, near the moulin rouge restaurant.  Moulin Rouge restaurant ok, but not excellent and our server had a bit of an attitude. Tons of cafes to choose from in the Montmartre district.  The hotel sits in a quiet street, near a laundromat--which came in handy.  The lift isn't in the best conditions, but doable for only one person at a time. Great experience overall.",5
5513,The hotel have very good location next to the best shopping street in Berlin. The rooms are  big and clean. Food is exellent at breakfast and on the bar . Staff are very helpful  I will come back again......,5
5514,"Booked a room on the executive floor to have access to the lounge but that proved to be very disappointing.  Breakfast is limited to a few items and is the exact same every single day.  There are more choices in the main restaurant which defeats the purpose of the executive lounge.  Drinks are only served from 6-8pm and again are limited to only 1 choice of red/white wine. Spirits are poorly displayed and when they run out (even after they've just opened at 6) they've ran out, no stock whatsoever.  We had to complain that they had no scotch whisky for them to manage to find a leftover bottle with a 3rd of it left in it.  Of all the Accor hotel and lounge we've stayed at this one offered by far the lowest standard.   On the other hand the staff are nice but could definitely…",2
5515,"The location next to Sloterdijk station is ideal. The room itself that I stayed in was spacious, clean and everything was high quality and well maintained. Decoration was of questionable taste (I would describe it as: wallpaper to look like old fashioned wooden panels, possibly originally clipart).  This place is probably better if you want to stay for a few days at a time and make use of the kitchen/facilities/buy some of your own food, because that's how it is set up. If you're expecting it to be like a normal hotel there are a few missing bits. For example tea and instant coffee are provided but no milk in the rooms, not even little UHT tubs. I guess this is because if you stayed a while you'd buy your own milk from the supermarket.  The only big problem I had was being asked…",3
5516,"Hotel is in the narrow Lane and there is NOTHING outside... not in 300-400 mtrs. The so called travel desk number given to guests by the staff is actually an outside vendor who sits at the hotel main gate.. Don't Book From Him.. he over charges like crazy... I booked a cab for a drop to candolim market and he charged 400rs and while coming back I got a cab for 250rs. What felt extremely wrong to me was that while giving his no. The front desk person called him reliable and reasonable.  The rooms are very very small like literally small and very basic. Nothing fancy or luxurious about it.  Housekeeping staff is good, and the overall cleanliness of the property is good.  Breakfast was almost exactly the same for all three days ... Just maybe 1 dish different.  ",2
5517,Dirty rooms with super uncomfortable beds. Dirty bed sheets and covers. Very old hotel but pictures on the website are enhanced so you would think it is almost new. Very expensive comparing to much better hotels in the area. Bad smell in the toilet. Old tiles on the balcony which isn't usable. Only good thing is the view. ,2
5518,"There were various signs in the hotel rather randomly publicising the 117th anniversary of the hotel. The hotel rather has the feel that may be the last time anyone spent any money on it. Other reviewers have said the hotel is ""tired"" - that is correct. The bath/shower leaked water and kept changing temperature significantly. The public areas around the pool were very tired - dusty old unused bars. The gym has a couple of running machines, the rest of the equipment is old and needs throwing away. The inner courtyard is lovely but a pretty average breakfast. We booked a room for 2 adults and 2 children and then were sent a confirmation email stating that there would be a double bed and one single in the room - clearly we questioned this and the hotel insisted on charging us 25…",2

We had a great first impressions of the Hotel when we were greeted by Michael at the front desk, who gave us lots of tips on places to visit. We were also offered an upgrade to a superior room, which was fantastic.  We stayed in room 605 on the 6th floor and had a great view of the Berliner Dom and church. Our room was lovely and clean with comfy beds and a great rocking chair to enjoy the view in!  We had opted to have breakfast elsewhere during our stay, and there are two great little cafe's that served breakfast (Chipps & Lunchtime) around the corner from the hotel.   All in all, a great stay. Would definitely recommend spending some time relaxing in the steam room and the two sauna's also.",5
5520,"Stayed in this hotel for a long weekend with friends and loved it.  All the staff were very helpful and professional, the room was nice, light and clean, well laid out, with comfortable beds and a beautiful bathroom. The food was very nice and the location excellent, with easy access to the city center. I'd recommend it to anyone  :-)",4
5521,"My friend and I enjoyed our stay at the hotel, and found the location especially handy for sightseeing around the city. The hotel was clean and tidy, and could not be faulted. My only reason for not giving a 5* review is that we did not use all the facilities (i.e. breakfast) and so could not comment on how good these were. I would think about staying here again on my next Berlin trip. The area around Nollendorfplatz U-bahn was pleasant enough, and helpful for travelling around the city (due to there being a few different U-bahn lines from here).",4
5522,"Came here for a work event for a staff of 35 . Hotel and Facilites were very nice , good sized pool and rooms . The beach was not walking distance from the resort which meant motorised buggy which you could only take from the pool and not reception. Service was 0/5 limited English , no care factor , a 7.30 knock at the door Sunday morning for a check out which was a mistake , event food for our gala dinner was terrible . Breakfast buffet satisfactory . This resort has so much potential but needs execution . Overall rooms and Facilites 4/5, Event food 0/5 , Breakfast 4/5 , staff friendliness 0/5 . A lot of training required to get this hotel up to expectation . ",2

I had requested balcony rooms for the superior room booking. Only 1 with balcony was offerred, and the room I had felt vacuum packed. The rooms are not large compared with many other hotels in Lisbon. The bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom adaquate, although the shower was half hearted and the drains totally useless. Light switches are random complex affairs. I was really angry about the hotel policy on water and coffee. Yes, they do give you 3 pairs of coffee sachets for the machine, and a bottle of water on arrival. This is a one off, and water is not given on subsequent nights and if you want more coffee, it is charged at 2.6Euros…",3
5524,"If you realize this is a budget hotel, you will be very satisfied. No, there isn't a phone or a closet, but the TV was amazing and the air conditioning excellent (important on a very hot day). The location is interesting, being part of the new Mall of Berlin, which used to be the famous Wertheim department store before WWII. ",4

Forgot to clean and bathroom and kitchen area. ... everyday...  Dirty sofa, dirty carpets, noisy staff in the corridor... should not be 4* rated. Have been in many hotels in Nha Trang, even 2 * have better quality. Only the location is good  The rooms had windows on 2-3 sides, but our room did not have any balcony ( as described at the booking) or a window we could open to get air. Only air condition",2
5526,I felt the staff was rude and not helpful.  We had problems with the internet connection and they could of cared less. The room was extremely tiny. We were guest of a very large wedding being held on the property and the staff wasn't very helpful to the bride and groom. ,1
5527,Just returned for a 3 night stay at the Grouptel Gran Via.   Out room was very clean on arrival and this was maintained by the maids daily. The pool was perfect to recharge our batteries after all the sightseeing.  The breakfast was good and a lot of choice.  Perfect hotel to take in the sights of Barcelona.     ,4

Hotel it self it's nice, rooms clean, housekeeping staff friendly. Hotel is located close to the beach, which it's always good thing. Unfornutelly I must say reception service disappointed me completely. It suppose to be face of the hotel by giving best impression of all. It was nothing like that. The reception manager's attitude was a disgrace. We came across person who doesn't really care about hotel guests, never smiles, there was no complimentary service, even asked for pen and pencil you have been given cold look like it was a big deal for her. I felt really unwelcome there, and this is a shame because I am working in…",2
5530,"Service was excellent, rooms nice, good beach, fun pool but I have to give it a poor rating due to the lack of parking. They have more rooms then parking spaces. When I first arrived at 8:30 pm, after checking in, I went to park the car; could not find a single space. I told the front desk I couldn't find any parking and was told I could park on the street. All the parking spots on the street were taken but I was able to squeeze in the car behind the last parked car on the street with about a third of my car in a no parking zone. I had to walk about three blocks back to the hotel. Don't even think about parking in the shopping mall next door; you'll get towed.",2

5535,"Asia Hotel ticks all the boxes of a four star hotel. Upon visiting, however, the hotel is quite outdated. The pool is very small and in the middle of the restaurant area, which is a rather odd location. I was visiting Hue for business, and had to work in my room quite often. Unfortunately the room was quite dark, with brownish furniture, and lights were cold blueish - which did not add to a good atmosphere. Moreover, the room was not very clean, with dusty corners, and some stains on the carpet. Overall, Asia Hotel offered less than I expected. On the positive side however, are the excellent location, and most of the staff were friendly.",2
5536,"Had a lovely stay at this hotel. Our room had a separate living room to the bedroom so was really spacious. Really clean and nicely maintained. The U-Bahn entrance is just outside of the hotel and is only 2 stops to Alexanderplatz.  A lot of museums within walking distance which is great.   The free mini bar with 2 bottles of water and beer each day is a really nice touch. Would definitely stay here again.  Only reason for not giving 5 stars is that for us house keeping was a bit random. Some towels replaced but others not, face cloths taken but not replaced, no toilet roll or tissues replaced so had to ask for some at reception. Also at 18 euros each breakfast seemed a little steep so we opted for grabbing something from a bakery instead. None of which was of a major concern we wouldn't hesitate to stay again. …",4
5537,"We found this hotel through booking.com. The rooms were fine, bed was comfy and bathroom clean. They have a restaurant downstairs with a menu card and USD prices. Everything is expensive and small portions. If you want to eat in Ninh Binh go to Trun Tuyet restaurant, its the best. The staff was horrible and did not speak English well, my partner got really sick on the day we were supposed to check out. I asked if it was okay if we checked out one or two hours later because he just threw up and had to lie down. All they said was, check out time is twelve if you stay longer its 100000 VND per hour. I tried to explain again that we could not leave because my partner was sick and when he finally understood he said: I think you should stay another night. My partner was so mad about…",2

5539,"Room was very small. “Ocean view” description forgot to include the other high rise hotel directly in front of Vive, blocking the ocean. Windows were small enough to funnel only the hottest UV rays onto our faces.   Found a cockroach scurrying around the bathroom after we had both showered in it. Front desk was unable to find another room or upgrade us, I highly doubt there was another room they could’ve given us though. They sent Anthony to kill the bug with Raid, but only after stepping all over our room with his work boots. In the end, we only got a meager refund for half a night’s sleep. Will not recommend that roach hotel to anyone else.   ",2

Excellent links to city, airport, and open air bus. Good value apartments that sleep up to 6. Would recommend based on value for money. Would benefit from kettle and toaster in the kitchen.",4
5541,We booked this hotel because the listing said it had parking and an airport shuttle. When we arrived the parking was in a public lot a block away and the 'airport shuttle' was a taxi costing £25 (more than one on the street). Our confirmation email promised a late check out at 2pm (we had a late evening flight) but this wasn't possible either. We would never have chosen this hotel had we know the services listed weren't available. The room was ok but the chest of drawers was broken with the drawers permanently hanging open.,2

The only thing was the shower is close to the bed. Not a huge problem tho, but the area between the bed and the shower can get wet. Public transport nearby aswell. Will stay here again.",4
5543,"The drinks were pricey but good, and the roof top was nice with pleasant views.Funny thing, we both got sick from the food here and for the high prices, we'd expect more. The staff is nice but management will knock you over to walk past and have the personality of a roach. So, for drinks and views, yes, food, i wouldn't try it.",2

5547,Stayed only the 1 night but the standard and cleanliness of the hotel were outstanding. The welcome and professionalism of the staff particularly on reception was 1st Class.

I had a double room on the first floor overlooking the street. The hotel was quiet with no noise within, and only noise from the bars across the road until 11pm. No aircon, so when it was a heatwave (38 degrees) I kept the curtains closed with the window open, but it didn't get too hot inside. Bed was comfy, although they didn't provide a topsheet, only a single duvet and one pillow. Free wifi was good. Shower room was very clean.

When I called the reception, we were informed something about winter and a regular temperature inside the hotel. We were informed there was nothing that could be done.

5552,"This hotel has a 4 star rating which is probably to do with the fact that it has sun deck & outdoor pool, indoor pool & jacuzzi and offers massages. It does look over the sea, is decorated in a clean, modern fashion and our room was large with a balcony and sea view. However, the beds had been positioned to obscure the electrical sockets and the switches for the lights. Our TV was not working on arrival but was fixed fairly quickly. You have to pay to use the room safe. There was a good range of food at breakfast but my fried egg was not properly cooked and the rest of the hot food was actually luke-warm.

My wife had a dish that came with quinoa. She asked for no quinoa, but instead mashed potatoes instead. Not a substitution, I told the waiter I was more than happy to pay the 15 dollars for the potato’s. Of course there was quinoa on the plate and I got to hear about it for the rest of the night.

This was the case on our tour bus and also in our room at the Westin with bottles labelled accordingly. ..... There is also a slightly larger bottle next to the kettle (ideal for morning tea) but be warned, this is a sneaky Westin strategy and if you use this bottle you'll be charged 80 RMB.

It's clean, has a view of Fira, a swimming pool, and feels safe.  The downside - be warned that Mesotopos is NOT located in Fira - you must either walk 30 minutes to get there on the main street or take a bus/cab/ATV.  Also, the ""breakfast"" that is provided is simply bread with butter and jam and coffee/juice if you want it.  The price is a little expensive for what you get.

Well, within certain perspective, it maybe deserves the rating, but given the following two things it is really a mediocre one, even by the Chinese standards. First, the assortment of foods offered at the breakfast isn't really impressive. Second, and this was most serious for me while staying at Pullman Skyway Shanghai, is that Wi-Fi access from my mobile phone was impossible in my room. The hotel itself does have a wireless network, which is non-free (nonsense, in my opinion, for a five-star hotel, for God's sake!).

The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom (with a shower/tub combo) was very nice. We did not try the spa during our stay.  Overall, it was a great hotel for a few days in Paris! I would definitely stay at Le Mathurin in a return trip to Paris. I would recommend this hotel to any person visiting Paris.",5
5568,Really lovely rooms with lots of space.  Everything was in perfect condition The only thing wrong was to soft beds Really Nice breakfast with everything to eat. Easy and free parking beside the hotel if you are lucky,4
5569,We stayed here for a weekend and we were really content about the location and the very friendly staff. The rooms are small but very clean. The bed was for two normal sized adults a little bit to small (we never slept in a bed so small!). Perfect hotel with a perfecr staff. Highly recommended!,5
5570,This is a comfortable hotel with excellent staff with easy links to many attractions. When  we next come to Paris we will  stay here again. the rooms are comfortable and the breakfast was excellent. spa looks good but we did not have time to use it.,5
5571,"Not a 5 star experience despite attractive rooms and well-meaning staff. Painfully slow room service, really poor food, long delays when calling service desk and few staff with English. I know the world doesn't speak English, but I do expect a 5 star hotel that's part of an international chain to have a desk staffed by staff with a reasonable degree of English competence. Similarly, I expect the western items on the menu to be edible (the veggie burgger was appalling but one of only two vegetarian choices).",2
5572,"I can only say good things about this place. The location is great, so close to the city. We walked most of the time, but Bahnhof Friedrichsstrasse is just around the corner. The rooms were okay, just a basic city hotel. Everything was clean and got cleaned every day. Our room was facing the street, which was a bit noisy, so we had to close the windows. There is no aircon in the room, so it got a bit sticky in there with the windows closed, but that doesnt bother me. Breakfast was in the hotel over the road, which has a beautiful courtyard. it was very relaxing. the buffet had lots to offer and everything was delicious. Staff was always friendly and attentive. it was a pleasant and uncomplicated stay.",4

It would suit more mature people are something with historic style. It has wifi but doesn't have a kitchen so no room service. I was there for business and it didn't really work for me. Very friendly staff, afternoon tea & cakes, okay breakfast and free port! Location is okay but on a back street slightly.",3

5577,"We stayed here over Easter weekend and our trip was perfect! We were greeted by friendly staff everyday, who were on reception to assist us everytime we needed. The rooms are small but lovely with everything you need. The hotel is in an ideal location, less than a 10 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower where we went and enjoyed a crepe every night & a 10-15 minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe/champs-Élysées! We actually got engaged on our trip and our hotel contributed massively to the amazingness of our little break! I would definitely recommend this hotel.",5

5579,"We are currently staying in The Leonardo Hotel, it is located in the Alexanderplatz area of the city, which is great for bars, restaurants, shops and for the U-Bhan and S-Bhan to help you around the city tourist attractions. The rooms are very clean and comfortable with a variety of modern amenities including a TV, coffee machine, mini bar (for your own drinks), free WiFi etc. The hotel, for being moderately priced has a very nice atmospheric bar area serving a variety of drinks. The hotel offers a very good breakfast with a very wide variety of foods including cereal, cold meats, fresh fruits and cooked foods plus as much coffee as you want. If I come back to Berlin then I will certainly be looking to book here again. ",5

The valet workers took my bags and opened the trunk before I got to the car so I couldn't see the tail light. I called right when I noticed and was passed around to at least 6 different people until someone gave me the number to your claims department. I called the number and it was a T-Mobile store. I called again, and was passed around some more, and I asked to speak with a manager. Instead of getting a manger, they sent me to the valet workers. I told them my story (for the 10th time) and they pretty much said I'm out of luck. But they gave me another number they claim was the claims office. I called the number and it doesn't even…",1

We were happy with our rooms however the balcony isn’t really a balcony, you can bearly fit two people on it. As the holiday went on we were presented with rudeness from staff mainly in the buffet/dining area. It felt as though they didn’t really care for their guests. It was like a guessing game the whole time as they didn’t really understand anything and just seemed to brush you off. The pool area and views are fantastic and I could not fault this! Madeira as a whole is a stunning island and Funchal is absolutely beautiful and I would love to visit again however I will stay at another hotel perhaps a little closer to the harbour. I feel there are a definitely few…",3

Room too small with only one bed, and not extra appliance (not refrigerator and microwave). In addition, the bathroom was terrible designed, the showerhead is located in the opposite location which means is located in the entry part of the bathtub. Getting water with appropriated temperature in the showerhead was a nightmare. Air conditioner terrible old and EXTREMELY NOISE. In addition, the staffs were kind of rude with us, when we did our late checkout, even though that we were willing to pay extra for our neglecting. The breakfast buffet was very expensive.",1

Everything about this place screams ""tear me down & build condos here!!!""...  If this place was in New York it would be a welfare hotel...  The bed and pillows smell musty and are probably decades old....  I feel like I need to burn all my luggage....  I'd rather wipe my rear end & flush the money I wasted on this placed own the toilet.... Any review above 2 stars are either from the management or somebody who needs medication & professional help.... Stay someplace else!!!!!  Hopefully if there is another earthquake this place will be destroyed!",1

5587,"We recently booked three rooms for a multi-day visit to Berlin with family. We had elderly, teen and middle-aged adults in our party and all were happy with their stay at Citadines Ku'damm. The two minor issues were that the tub was too high for our elderly family member to use and it wasn't clear to us if there were any accessible rooms available. The other issue is that it was very hot and the air conditioning doesn't work well at all (so it was uncomfortably warm in our room most nights). Having said that, the place is in a good location. The staff are very friendly. The café over the road (Zeit für Brot) is awesome. There are loads of buses nearby and multiple other transport options within walking distance. We would certainly stay again though perhaps we would be more…",4

I had emailed the hotel before arrival to organise a few details and they could not have been more accommodating.  Jerome and all the reception staff deserve praise for their helpfulness, professionalism and friendliness - nothing was too much trouble. Our room, a superior twin, was spacious by Parisian standards and was clean, comfortable and had some lovely personal touches upon arrival. Our room had a safe, iron, fridge, bottle of wine, as well as tea and coffee making facilities.  The location is great, a quiet neighbourhood just outside the centre of Paris. Getting the metro to the centre takes about 20-25 mins and is relatively cheap. The hotel organised our transfer…",5

They offer fantastic reasonable priced room service, comfortable beds, great shower. The extras in the female friendly rooms are fabulous, hot water bottles should be offered in every hotel. The also have a gym and sauna.",5
5591,"This hotel is very underwhelming.  The rooms are utile, but not very spacious or comfortable.  The free wifi in the lobby is essentially worthless.  I paid another $20/day for in-room wifi, but it was still unreliable and slow when I was able to connect. The hotel is fairly close to a subway station, but so are hundreds of others and there's not that much nearby other than the Jing'an temple.  I'd accept this kind of mediocrity at a cut-rate hotel, but this room was literally twice as expensive as others that I've stayed at.  Unless your company requires you to stay at a Hilton, stay at the Grand Central Hotel - it's half the price and much, much nicer.",2
5592,"I need to iron my shirt and coat.  When you book a hotel in such a good district you expect something above every day Holiday Inn Express or Comfort Inn, which ALL have irons for simple business traveler.  This hotel does not, and that is that.  For this reason I chose ""bad"" rather than ""reasonable"" because any decent manager would realise how unreasonable it is to not offer this to guests, and would say ""sorry sir, we will go get one and bring it to you as soon as we can"", this hotel just stop at the first word, ""sorry"".",2

It is 10-12 Euro taxi ride to the airport - getting around is a breeze.  We booked through the official website, although it was much higher price than booking through other booking channels, we got a football signed by Cristiano so the boyfriend thought it was worth it.  When it comes to the room, the bathroom was tiny considered the price we paid, although we are staying in the basic room category. Here comes the downside, the first night was ok, then the second night we started to hearing this loud ventilation noise that sounded like people kept walking with heels on wooden floor upstairs, the third night it was even worse, its…",3

The faucets in the shower were at the far end of a half enclosed bathtub and were very hard to reach even for my 6'2"" husband.  We never did get a hot shower.  Breakfast was fine.  Staff were fine except for the fact that they didn't tell us the price of their parking. For a 3 day stay parking cost 181.50 euros, which i find outrageous. We have never paid that in any major city. Would i go back or recommend, I would have to think long and hard on that.",3

We had a white comfort garden room - they are so well designed to maximise space.   The air con: this was a real pain. We went last week and it was 30 degrees, so although we were offered a fan for the bedroom (thank goodness), it was still unspeakably hot in the room and so three consecutive nights when it was difficult to sleep. We had the windows open and the little fan on - but because it was so hot others stayed in the garden into the small hours, so some rather loud shrieking which added to our grumpiness. No discount offered either.   The air con was fixed on the Thursday daytime, so the day before we left. No note left…",4

We stayed in one of the apartments for a week and the apartment had the basic necessities but not much else. There is a very basic kitchen area but it was to much hassle to try and cook anything there so we didn't. The location of the hotel is good, about 1.5km walk down to the central parts of Funchal. There are a good variety of restaurants in the vicinity and and a really good grocery store within 10 min walking distance. There are two outdoor pools that are not heated and one small indoor pool that is.

There is no entertainment during the day and if it rains as it did whilst we were there you have nothing to do other than go back to your room. The village of Santa Cruz is very basic with little to see and nothing to do. The food in the hotel was fine although a little repetitive, the seafood night was the best. The entertainment in the evenings was poor at the best and on several nights non-existent. This is certainly a hotel we will not return to. The wi-fi  in the room was very poor although it was good in the reception, restaurant and bar. We booked the hotel on the basis that we use Vila Gale regularly in the Algarve but we found it very disappointing.",3

This maybe acceptable and tolerable during the day but not after sunset because the way back into the hotel is totally pitch black and quite eerie. The bus brings you to station Koepenick with trains that will take you direct to the city. The various connections of public transport is quite good, but we decided to take a taxi to avoid the darkness of the woods and it costs 20€ from Koepenick train station to the hotel.

Our flight arrived early, so we decided to go to the hotel first to see if we could possibly check in early or just leave our bags until check in time. Upon check-in, we were told there was a room ready, but that'd we'd have to pay $50 for early check-in. This is something I've never experienced at a nice hotel, but we agreed to pay it anyways.

The same room type we reserved with points wasn’t available the other night for a revenue stay so we got one in the next level category, which gave us the opportunity to experience two rooms. We saw no significant between them - in fact, the higher category room type was higher up on the hill (which translates to less privacy, as more people walk by your room on their way up to the street).  My chief complaint is that the first room, room 3, had a jacuzzi pre-set to a cold temperature that nobody admitted we couldn’t change until after three phone calls and an hour and a half of waiting for the tub to heat up. For the price of these rooms, the jacuzzis should work and the staff - ALL of them - should be trained in how they work so as…",3

The room was so small you only had room for a double bed and enough space in the bathroom for 1 person. The air con was locked on heating by the hotel and having the shutters closed overnight meant you couldn't open the windows making the room really stuffy. When we did open the window the pastry shop below have outside speakers which have music coming from them as soon as they open early in the morning.  On the plus side, the staff are really friendly and helpful and to be fair it's just somewhere to sleep for the night and forces you to be out and about enjoying the sites of Lisbon.",3

Every employee was nice about letting us in anyway, but it would have eliminated that minor annoyance for us every morning if someone would have just fixed it. The room stayed rather warm at night; we tried air conditioning but ended up opening the window. Fortunately, the hotel and surrounding area was quiet. Everything else was great.",4
5629,"We had a great short weekend att the Hotel, the receptionists were really nice and helpful. The room was clean and well lit. And even though the hotel is located far west from the city, there was only a few metres to the U-bahn, and 20 minutes to potsdamer. ",4
5630,The service was great. Ines was very hospitable and we felt really welcome. She also gave us great tips about Paris and how to deal with pickpockets. She even welcomed us in Chinese!!!! How great. The hotel has a great Paris vibe. Very recommended and would definitely come again.,5
5631,"Spent three nights here for business and I shall not return. I had been here in the past, just for dinner and drinks to admire the view, which is spectacular. The view of the river and the historical buildings is fantastic.  This is the reason my colleagues and I booked the hotel.  However, the rooms are shabby and in need of renovation. As other reviewers have mentioned, there are spots, scratched furniture, some lack of hygiene in the bathrooms.  Our room in a high floor did have an excellent view.   The staff just don’t care. They process a high volume of clients and there is no personal attention. The food is average. Carpets in the main areas of  the hotel are very dirty and need replacing rather than just cleaning. Breakfast is a massive buffet . Yes there is a great…",2
5632,We stayed for 3 nights and really enjoyed our stay. We was a bit disappointed when we arrived as the look of the hotel from the outside wasn’t the best but it improved once we got inside. The staff are very friendly and the whole hotel is spotlessly clean. The area is quiet and beds comfy so we slept well. The pool is clean and small but the view of flats opposite was awful (not much they can do about that unfortunately.) The Wifi was also good. We didn’t try the breakfasts as we thought 17 euros each was a little too pricey. Instead we ate at the cafe’s just outside the hotel which were tasty and cheaper.  The hotel is a 5 minute walk to the metro station where you can get a 10 visit ticket to the centre for just 10 euros which we both used. Took approx 15 minutes to get into…,4
5633,"I stayed in an apartment which was huge with shared kitchen and bathroom. It wasn't a modern decor, but was clean and everything worked. There isn't a common kitchen, which might be a problem for more independent travellers, but the her serves pretty good food and Berlin has plenty of great places to grab a bite to eat.   The staff were great - relaxed and friendly. The cleaners did an admirable job of keeping the place tidy, which is a difficult job considering some of the people staying there. The bar can get busy and loud which would be fine, but it also serves as the common area. That being reign during the day it was a fairly chill place and a good area to catch up with people.   Location wise it was great. Close to all of the main tourist attractions and the Rosa Luxemburg…",4
5634,"I directly claimed the bad sewage like smell when I checked in for a 2 weeks stay, some maintenance guys did something to correct the issue. This was repeated during 5 days, mostly when coming back from my business tasks until I finally got enough after one week and got the manager in charge to visit my room to experience this smell herself. After 6 nights I could check in to a room without smell, this due to the great help of Gabriel Gao. The location is great in the Xintiandi area, but I am sorry to state that Ascott, in despite of that they state to be a higher class of serviced apartment provider, don't seem to live up to this. You should not be exposed to that You have to wait six days to get a room smelling of sewage corrected.",2
5635,"The hotel is a good budget hotel located right next to Marques Pombal square. It is centrally located to all the major attractions. The rooms were large and spacious and clean. The breakfast spread was decent. The lifts were slightly on the slower side and would not be a problem unless you have a lot of luggage.   We stayed there for two days and the day we checked into our room, we saw our air conditioner was not working (which is a must in Lisbon). As we were leaving for our sight-seeing in the afternoon, we notified the reception who said they will take care of it. When we came back at night, it was still not working. We notified the problem again and a hotel staff came in who spoke limited English. He kept on gesturing that it was broken and asked us to stay put in the room…",3

It is in a very noise area we can't sleep until 2 am because the club cross street have the music very loud. Next time I have to check better  ",2
5637,"This hotel is in a great location and on a great building.  They have recently remodeled their lobby  and the restaurant is actually not bad; they offer a great breakfast buffet.  The facilities are good.  The rooms however leave a lot to be desired.  Carpets are very old, stained, and smelly.  The bathrooms are dirty with a great deal of mold and mildew around the showers and toilets.  Some bedrooms have plumbing issues and water is very slow to drain in shower stalls and sinks.  Whenever you need services, response is very slow.  I needed my safe to be unlocked upon checking and it took them 6 hours to show up.  I had to call the front desk 7 times before someone picked up the phone so i could setup a wake up call.  They do not offer the ability to get a taxi and charge it to…",2

Bed was really comfy and everything cleaned beautifully!l. Staff were helpful and polite and the hotel is in a lovely location. ",5
5639,"We booked the Aspria for a weekend away and we were not disappointed. The spa facilities were great, one of the best I have experienced and there was a great choice of treatments. The breakfast was amazing with mainly continental options but plenty of choice and excellent quality. It made a perfect base for sightseeing!",5
5640,"The hotel itself is lovely. There isn't a decent view but that didn't matter as didn't spend much time there. The rooms and bathroom are a good size and very clean. The pool is small, good for a dip but not a swim. The rooftop has a bar and lots of seating. Didn't have any breakfast as thought 16 euro is a bit too much to pay for that. Overall, it was a good stay. The receptionists were very helpful with any queries, especially Xavi.",4
5641,"We stayed 3 nights in this hotel. The location is perfect as it is 5 minutes walking distance from the Sloterdijk station, which is 10 minutes from the Central Station Amsterdam by train. However, the room is very small and has perhaps 20 m2 max. It is not a 4* hotel. Price / quality is OK for Amsterdam.",3
5642,We stayed at OD Barcelona during our 5 nights.  This hotel was for us perfect. Staff were amazing and everyone was so nice with exuberant HOLA every morning.  Their smiles were a great way to begin the day. Breakfast was very good and the manager was excellent with his cappuccino.  When we left at 5.30am they even prepared a boxed breakfast for us. The hotel is very central to most tourist sites and within walking distance. When you arrive ask for a kettle because tea and coffee is not provided but that does not detract from the hotel. My recommendation is to give it a try.,4
5643,"We ended up in the Savoy Saccharum having intended to book the Savoy Calheta. When we realised our mistake we tried to move the reservation. But the hotel did not handle this well, taking our money up front and refusing to cancel the reservation so we could stay at the other Savoy which is in the same village of Calheta, in walking distance.  We have three children and wanted a beach hotel - whereas the Savoy Saccharum is really for couples and not very child friendly. Happily we were able to walk to the beach anyway which is open to the public.  So please be careful which one you book!  As for the hotel itself, it is comfortable enough. However the swimming pools (one on the roof and one inside) are small - so don't go for that. Despite offering a children's club, the hotel…",3
5644,"I had a wonderful stay for 3 days.  A beautiful hotel with a history. Within 10 minutes on foot from the zoo station in the center of former West Berlin. It was a room without air conditioning, But I didn't feel the need even in mid-August. Of course, the staff are amazing. I visited restaurant and bar, But unfortunately I don't know because I  drink only coffee. If I have next visit, I would love to have a drink and eat at that wonderful restaurant and bar. In summary, It is a hotel that feels worth more than the accommodation costs.  I am thankful for a memorable 3 days stay. Thank you very much.",5
5645,"The hotel is actually really fantastic; and as a frequent traveler to Amsterdam, it was a great base to get to know a new neighborhood ( Oud West).  Great design. Great location...but the check in process was problematic. We were made to wait, literally falling asleep in the lobby, because our room wasn’t cleaned yet. It actually came across as a tad sadistic, as no one seemed to be bothered that we were waiting. Beyond that, no complaints. We won’t stay here again...but wouldn’t advise other# not to chose this hotel.",3
5646,"We enjoyed our stay, the room was cozy, with high and decorated ceiling. The view from our window was to a park and restaurant, which was ok. But the morning were blissful with the birds chirping. The location is great, steps away from bus stand and few restaurants. Only draw back is the bathroom smells but when you close the door, you do not get the smell outside. When we asked the front desk about the smell, they said it is because of the water level rising above.",3

5651,"This boutique hotel was beautifully decorated and contained all of the amenities that we were looking for during our stay. We stayed in one of the top floor rooms with a balcony which had a very Parisian view of tall townhouses and the Sacre-Coeur in the background. We visited for my birthday and the hotel did a great job of decorating the room for us as well as providing us with some complementary macaroons.  From the bathroom we had a great view of the Eiffel tower, however one observation was that the toilet was for some reason very high! (Even for me and I am 5ft 7”).  During the day the room was lit beautifully by the sunlight coming in from the large balcony doors, however in the evenings the room was very dark as there were only a couple of dim ceiling lights and lamps to…",5

Good and quiet location. Healthy breakfast if you choose wisely, wifi a bit slow, but will do on holidays. We lived in a small, but quiet and absolutely clean room, slept soundly on fine matresses. Small, but efficient bathroom, shower accesories, shoe polish. And two pillows each! Magazines and second hand books at your disposal. Very friendly staff, flexible and relaxed and very French. Good English skills, though. A nice stay.",5

5654,"I stayed here for over a week recently in a studio room. It was spotlessly clean and comfortable. Good for a long term visit. The breakfasts were excellent, one of the best I've had in Berlin. Having a room at the back meant it was quiet with no noise from the street. The breakfast/lounge area upstairs is also a nice place to hang out in the evening.  Two small problems. The front desk only has people on it from 7-5pm. Annoying if you are out working all day and need something when you return, also if you need to check out early. The room cleaners also forgot to lock my room on 2 occasions.  Having said that, I would stay here again.",4
5655,"If you're looking for a family hotel that's off the main drag, this is the place. And I mean that as a compliment. Though it's close to Anaheim and other locations in Orange County - it's a very quiet hotel that serves a steady business clientele but also families looking to get away. The rooms are huge, but could use some updating. It has a very pleasant lobby and reading area and the staff is extremely helpful. Stayed here for a week in June and couldn't have been more pleased with the service, location and price. The breakfast buffet was fairly repetitive but with enough choices to certainly get you off to a good start every day. Other than some fairly dated (but clean) rooms, have nothing negative to say and would gladly stay here again.",2

No room for temporary parking and then you are free for the town parking gods. Breakfast: bring your coffee because you do not get one in your room and when you ask at the breakfast you wait a min of 15-20 min. Breakfast served ad-hoc, meaning the initial set-up was not made for an easy breakfast access. We've been told this was a new hotel with a theme on each floor(ours was cocoa) but nobody had time to entice us with the other floors so we would come back.",3

Not a huge deal but if you are expecting a beach front hotel then this is not the spot for you. The check in was fine, had better and had worse. The rooms are a pretty decent size and they all have balconies, which is a bonus. However the walls are very thin so if you're a light sleeper bring ear plugs. Also the beds are rock hard and the pillows are super flat. The food is plentiful and decent...but not if you're a vegetarian, not too many selections besides fries, cheese, and bread.  I think this hotel thinks it's more luxurious than it really is but maybe according to Lagos standards it is. If I could give half points then I would give Vila Gale 3.5 out…",3

Some of the basic amenities were missing (for example we didn't have hand tissues).   The service at the reception was lukewarm.

5694,"We stayed for 3 nights and found the hotel to be both stylish and comfortable. Food and drinks were excellent and the service friendly and unpretentious. It isn't cheap & we thought that the breakfast was a little overpriced but overall definitely worth it, we would go back.",4
5695,"The initial impression of this hotel was quite good. Everything has had a lick of paint and furniture seems relatively new. The service was also pretty efficient if a bit cold. Location is also pretty central to the old town. Unfortunately though this was one of those times where a place makes a good first impression only to fall down over the course of a stay.  Our bed was ok but made a lot of noise with any slight movement. To the hotel's credit they fixed this quickly. We also found that the min-bar was broken which they too fixed efficiently. All these things balanced themselves out to an ""average"" experience however the one thing that couldn't be fixed was the water pressure in the shower. I (with quite short hair) struggled to get it totally wet. Calling it a trickle would…",2
5696,"I stayed here for 3 nights in December with a group of 4. We decided to pay a little extra for a terrace as we had a smoker with us and thought that he would be able to smoke on it, we confirmed this when checking in with reception and was once again told smoking is allowed on the terrace, much to our disappointment on the first night the smoker was told he wasn’t allowed to smoke on the terrace and had to do it outside the apartment block which was very disappointing. The booking was easy to complete on the website however my conformation email went into my junk folder so beware of this. We had a ground floor apartment overlooking the canal, the living area is very nice and spacious with everything you would expect in a small apartment however our rooms were much more to be…",3
5697,"After I left they charged my credit card twice. First for something who was missing in the room. I had to make an expensive time-consuming call from Brazil to US to solve this. The second time, they are so unorganized and untrained to organize a transport and payment from the hotel to the Airport.   Never ever happened to me, that a hotel charged my credit card after I left. In addition, without any information before. This is the worst experience I ever had with a five star hotel. They do not deserve this 5 stars!",1
5698,"The hotel room was spacious but a bit worn out. The carpet was damaged and the shower has seen better days as well. Nevertheless the water pressure was ok and the water was hot. The room was clean and silent. The stuff at the reception doing the check in was friendly, the stuff doing the checkout wasn't. And checkout took quite a while.  If it wasn't for the location I would not book the hotel again. ",2
5699,"Although in our 60's, we were offered the 'Honeymoon Suite' - the only one still available.  We were quite happy with the offer, although it cost at least twice as much as the other lovely hotels we stayed in on other islands.   SANTORINI is expensive!! We were kept waiting for at least 25 minutes in searing heat until someone could take us to the suite.  There is no reception - you have to book in at the agency near the bus station. The position was wonderful - down many narrow steps in the heart of old Oia.  The views of the caldera from the very small terrace were truly spectacular.   On the terrace were 2 wooden slatted sun loungers but no pads - very hard to lie on.  We asked if any were available, but none materialised during the 4 days we were there.  There was an…",3
5700,I am NOT Happy with the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel at the moment. Myself and two other couples reserved rooms months ago. We received confirmations from Expedia and Hotmail yesterday confirming our reservations. My husband called yesterday to see if we could extend our stay by one night only to find out that our reservations had been cancelled by the hotel. Apparently someone forgot to block off rooms for a large group and they continued booking rooms. SHAME ON YOU - MILLENNIUM KNICKERBOCKER!! So far we do not have confirmed rooms downtown Chicago.,1

So, I have grown accustom to the usually high SPG standard and typically go out of my way to stay in a SPG property.   This hotel is in a amazing location, between Rush and Michigan Ave, beautiful building from the outside, but don't judge a book by the cover.  This hotel is horrible on the inside.    My room, 608, had a horrible odor the moment I entered it, a damp, moldy odor.  When I asked for another room, was told there was none.  I found black mold, massive water damage in the ceiling in multiple places, such a loud ceiling fan sounded like an engine from the 1980s with no oil.   Pictures to support everything.     Sadly this hotel has a ton of potential but…",1
5702,"The relatively new Ibis Liberdade is a typical Ibis property. Smallish, but clean and modern rooms, double-paned windows that keep out the noise, thin towels, and few amenities, but a pretty comfortable bed.  The service was friendly and the breakfast buffet pretty good for the money. One word of caution, the hotel sits near the top of a VERY steep hill and it's quite an uphill hike from the Avenida Metro stop. Take a cab there if you are dragging luggage. When returning to the hotel, I found it easier to get off at the Rato Metro stop and walk down Rua do Salitre which takes you to the top of the hill where the hotel sits.",3
5703,"I don’t even know where to begin. I found Hotel Eden Paris the night I missed my connection to NYC and I couldn’t have chosen a better hotel to stay at. The hotel was so chic and so clean. The room was small, but that’s typical of Europe so I wasn’t disappointed. The staff was so friendly and helpful - lent us extra adaptors, etc. The location was perfect for Uber pickups and it was also close to the metro. Breakfast was delicious every morning. The staff was also so nice and professional . Coffee, water, juices, and sodas were always available. I could go on and on stay here! I WILL COME BACK FOR SURE",5
5704,"Stayed at Cler Hotel for 6 nights and had an amazing experience. The staff is extremely courteous and helpful (not always a given in Paris). The location is great, walking distance to just about anywhere in the heart of Paris. Our only time using a car service was to and from the Airport, which the staff at Cler coordinated for us. Rue Cler has amazing local shops, restaurants and bars, but doesn’t feel busy or noisy. The hotel room is cozy and very clean, with modern furnishings. A great clean and cozy place to go back to, after a day of exploring the city. Would definitely recommend staying here, as we will upon our return. ",5
5705,"Stayed for just one night, the staff weren’t overly friendly however the rooms are nice, clean quite large and trendy. The shower was very nice.. large shower head that was moveable. Breakfast was good. There is a great mini supermarket round the corner and the shops are very close. There are some great bars nearby “rum trader” and I felt very safe walking around even at 2am. Would certainly stay there again.",4
5706,"Stayed here for 2 nights as part of a stag weekend, and the hostel did what we needed it to. Good value rooms, that were clean and comfortable. I was part of a larger group but was in a 4 bed room sharing with 2 other members of my group, and we were lucky enough to not have to share with anyone else. Toilet and shower facilities were ok and cleaned regularly which is the main thing when there are a lot of people sharing them. Reception was at the bar which wasn't the best especially when arriving in the evening but the staff were friendly and helpful, more than happy to give advice on what to see and what to do. Only downside is that the location isn't great, if nightlife is what you are after. The bar attached to the hostel was good but after that we struggled to find anyway…",4

Valet denied it, obviously, and refused to compensate for the hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars of damages to my brand new car.  Can’t be buffed out and will need to be fixed with a new paint job. Ridiculous.",1
5708,"This is a decent, if somewhat rundown, hotel in a central location.  There are some nice features, such as the ability to print boarding passes in the lobby, and the breakfast staff are very friendly. However, new carpeting is somewhat overdue.  The generally positive impression I had formed of the hotel was completely reversed when, on checking out, I found I had been charged a previously undisclosed $154 “destination fee”, something I have never before encountered.  The true calling of the front of house manager, Malcom Moore, should be in giving classes in professional rudeness for his ability to communicate his disinterest: “I’m sure you will find it was disclosed in the small print” and “I’m sorry if my demeanour gives you the impression I don’t care”.

The day we arrived the lady at the desk never called to let us know the room was ready, when finally got to the room at 11:30pm we had to go get our luggage and the room was not ready! BRIDGET said they would take care of the $250 upgrade charge, I was paying $350 for 2 queen beds so a $250 upgrade charge for a king bed and sleeper sofa that was not ready do not make sense and BRIDGET did not take off the $250 I had to go back down to the desk and ask them to take it off and BRIDGET said she was sorry and would have the hotel manager call but no one ever called me.

5715,"Stayed here for 4 nights over New Years.   The rooms are very basic like what you would get in a Marriott in the states 20 years ago.  Small TV, bad pillows, and just overall nothing exciting.   We also had an issue with a large number of ants in the room and were moved to another room and given free breakfast for 2 days, however the service in the restaurants isn’t very good.  Food at breakfast is average what you would expect of a typical breakfast buffet.   Certainly not worth the price of $40 US per person!!      The hotel is very historic and has nice grounds but overall I would choose another hotel in returning to Buenos Aires.  ",2
5716,"We were very disappointed with the lack of follow up to the problems we had with our room. The hotel grounds are breathtaking/beautiful and the restaurant staff (Captain’s Bar, Shipwreck Bar, Stevenson’s sushi, and Ilima Terrace) were great. However, the balcony of our room had not been properly cleaned prior to our arrival and had a glass full of cigarette butts and 2 more left in the plants. We also requested to have our bidet serviced since it was not working. After returning to the cleaned room, the room had been cleaned but neither of the 2 issues that were notified to the front desk were addressed. We had to go back to the front desk again to request the problem to be addressed. The manager of the front desk never came to talk to us in person and the front desk attendant…",2

Bathroom is nicely decorated and staff was very nice, they were really helpful about programs, too. The street can get very noisy at night, so make sure you close the window before going to bed.  The beach is in 10 minutes walk, but well worth the effort!  Had a wonderful stay with great memories!",3
5719,"We liked this hotel. But we were here when it was 30 degrees and as many other Northern European hotels, they do not have aircon. So it was hot!! But rooms are very spacious (walk in closet) and very clean. The location is great. Close to the subway, in a nice and calm neighborhood with plenty of pretty good restaurants. No really great ones, but after a full day in Berlin, they are ok. Parking is as also always in Europe, very tight parking spots, but they have private and safe parking. We never tried breakfast, so can not say anything about that. Nice staff! We would definitely stay here again. ",4

All the staff (with no exception) were friendly and seemed to enjoy their work. The rooms are well specified and the food (for an all-inclusive) is very good indeed.  The pool is also excellent and (despite what others have said) we never had a problem getting a sun-bed.   The clientèle also seem a little 'up market' being made up of multi-national families and couples.  The chain-smoking heavily tattooed chavs that other all-inclusives seem to attract were thankfully in short supply.   So what's the problem?  Well, for one, the bar arrangement is ludicrous.  Ignore the brochure/web site - there are only 2…",3

The Sorbonne, Pantheon and the Gardens are all within easy walking distance. Slightly further are St Sulpice and St Germain areas and the Latin Quarter but with the Metro everywhere is nearby. There are plenty of bars and restaurants again within walking distance. The hotel had a nice size room and bathroom with tea or coffee making facilities and a mini bar fridge. The staff were very friendly and helpful and we would definitely stay here again.",5

5724,"Check your room thoroughly!  I returned home after a two night stay with a tour group and found myself with over 40 bug bites. I contacted the corporate office which in turn referred me to the local hotel. The language barrier is terrible as it took two emails to get my concerns heard. In the end the hotel claims no bug issues in their rooms, however, I have been bitten numerous time and have pictures to prove it.  Apparently no hope for me so you have been warned check your room thoroughly so you have proof if you encounter bug bite.  Thanks for reading. ",2
5725,"I choose this hotel since it was eco-oriented and also fully vegeterian. How rare is that? I'd say I'm disappointed in the breakfast though. For me serving all soy-products is not the way to go. I'd want more options like chia-puddings, granolas, cashew cheese... Not just soy cheese, soy sausages etc. That said, the variety was good for breakfast considering the previous.  The beds weren't at all hard in my opinion. The desk in the room is perfect for ""office away from home"". Wifi decent. If you're in town for the fashion shows then Postbanhof is just 25 min walk away and SEEK is not far away either.  Oh! YOGA mat included.. Bonus points for that.",4

We suspect it might be caused by old pipes. Unpleasant. We kept windows and door open to keep room aired. Really could not do that at night. Our bathroom had a small leak. While it was small, the drain cup was located where one would stand to use the sink. They tried to fix it twice unsuccessfully. We ended up using a bucket to receive the drips. Rather unpleasant to have to hear the dripping all the time in the bathroom. Worse yet, no apologies whatsoever from management.",3

All the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful.  However there does appear to be a lack of staff, especially in housekeeping as our room often did not get cleaned until gone 5pm.    The whole place had a feeling of not being finished - the onsite gym from what we could see was completely empty of equipment and the spa which closed due to ""technical difficulties"" looked more like it was being refitted.  There was no shuttle bus service which, given that the walk into Lagos was a good 20 - 25 minutes, did seem a bit odd.

I just don't understand why they don't have a bar on the roof - it has the most fantastic view of the Sagrada Familia but you have to schlepp down to the lobby for a drink.  The room was very comfortable and stylish - great value for the price we paid.  Delicious breakfast. Good location. And it has a parking garage which is handy if you have a rental car - although €28/night for parking seems a bit expensive and it took us 3 attempts and almost half an hour to get our car out of the garage!! Maybe a buzzer to communicate with reception on the garage entrance and exit would save a lot of hassle?!  Overall this is a…",4

5755,This is a classic example that design does not a great hotel make - sure it cute and kitchy with the latest TV offering Netflix - which did not work - Hulu - which could not connect and uTube - which who cares. The room was the size of a postage stamp and smelled like Keith Richards after a bender.  This hotel is not worth the price of admission - the building is old and stinky - the carpets are filthy - having to take two different elevators to get to some of the rooms is ridiculous and inconvenient. For $20 more I could have stayed at the Sir Francis Drake - but I wanted to try something new and trendy - this place missed the mark big time.  Did I mention the cool expresso maker in my room - also did not work and the bath products - full size but the body wash smelled…,1
5756,"We drove for 10 hours from Los Angeles and reached San Francisco past midnight. On reaching the hotel, we came to know that the hotel was overbooked and we could not have our assigned rooms. We were a group of 10 people with 4 children. After a lot of confusion on the concierge we were directed to Parc55 hotel across the street to reside instead. We’ve been travelling for 20 days at a stretch and have a lot of luggage. They expect us to pack and unpack in a single night. I am disappointed in them and a hotel like Hilton is not expected to be so unprofessional. I would not recommend anyone to be at this hotel even though it is located at the premium location like the Union Square.  #hiltonsanfrancisco ",1

Our room was comfortable although the type of room which we booked did not have any tea or coffee making facilities. We did query this on departure and were advised these could have been provided on request but were not standard in our room category for space reasons. However, there was adequate space for a not in expensive mini bar!  While the central location is great - Gendarmenmarkt is one of the more expensive parts of town if you are looking for something to eat or drink near the hotel. Something to keep in mind if you don't want to venture too far from the hotel in the evening.",4

And I knew various corporate machinations had made them part of a bigger group, SBE. But now it is just corporate greed and lack of direction. This hotel is old. It is noisy. The service is patchy. I sat and watched furious guests at breakfast. The day spa is overlit and far from relaxing. But the worst thing was being locked out of my room after 7 nights because they had some issue with our travel agent. Even then, at 3am, getting my room key re-cut, they couldn't make good. I asked for a late checkout for the next day, before 30+ hours of flying and was charged $125. Then, when I got back to my room, the phone was beeping a flat battery, so I put in…",1

I've seen a brown paper bag blowing in the wind with more enthusiasm than this bloke. He didn't really care that people where checking in/out. It seems like this motel was a ""face"" for money laundering or people smuggling as there was no care what so ever. As our room wasn't ready we asked the guy if we could store our luggage, he told us there was no where for it.   All pillows on the beds where cut up prices of foam and looked as old as. In the bathroom the soap holder had mold and soap scum, and the breakfast area...well there was 6 chairs and and about 20 odd people trying to get a feed. Oh to make it even more crowded in the breakfast area there…",1

When one of us arrived, staff could be a bit friendlier at the reception. A reserve was made on one of our credit cards and an extra amount of €50,- was put on top, for the minibar. But when we arrived in the room there was an empty minibar?! Makes you wonder? The Authorisation reserve was also kept on the card for more than a week, which is not very nice when you are a frequent traveller.

As a frequent business traveler, I trust SPG hotels are usually very consistent and clean. I was attending meetings at this hotel, and mistakenly chose convenience over instinct. We read many other questionable reviews, but naively thought, it’s an SPG hotel, how bad could it be? Worse than I could have imagined.   My first room smelled like a combination of smoke and wet sponge, with peeling walls, ceilings and the grossest bathtub I’ve ever seen.

She wasn't smiling and didn't apologize for the wait, she actually acted like she didn't really want to be there. when I said who I was and the group and that this is our first time here, she looked at me like I was crazy. For the price we are paying for 30+ rooms I expected a little better service. Not sure if this chain has a rewards card wasn't asked about that either.

If you stay here share (or have your own ;) ) a pitcher of the hotel's sangria, hands down it was some of the best I had while in Barcelona! And the best part was that it was only 7 Euro for the whole pitcher, guarantee you will not find a deal better than that anywhere else.

Subway station was about a thirty seconds walk away from the hotel entrance.   There is only one minor thing, which stops me from giving the hotel five stars.

We had a studio room which was a reasonable size but not really an appartment , realistically it was a good hotel room. By calling themselves ""apartments "" they get away with not providing daily house keeping and amenities. It's a bit funny. Breakfast is not included and is a bit expensive for what you get at the Italian restaurant next door, which by the way, is excellent for evening dinner. No real problem with this ""hotel/appartment "" but would probably stay in the Hackescher market area next time for more food and shopping variety. ",4

I've stayed at this hotel many times before and have never had this kind of customer service that was given to me. Please be careful.

The remodel is a shoddy attempt to make this place hip and contemporary. The walls are paper thin and my 1st grader could have done a better job at the paint and repairs.  Not to mention a few clothing items went MIA and when I asked the front desk I repeatedly got the run around and calls went un returned.,2

The rooms were a bit on the flashy side for me with this rather 'tacky' red mural behind the bed , a red fridge and a mirrored wall with a flatscreen tv opposite the bed.

No slamming doors (quiet closure a feature?), no raised voices and the streets around the hotel residential, so also quiet. As I was on a work trip just the job and conveniently located for UPF and the beach.  The restaurant was busy in the morning but not a problem as folks keen to get out and about.

In this case, the location of the hotel is good for business or personal travel.  It’s a few short blocks off the Avenue Libertade and it’s close to public transportation, restaurants and local shops.  That’s all fine.  The room was clean as expected for HIE, but it was small and poorly laid out.  For example, the small bathroom’s awkward layout made access to the shower difficult.  Similarly, the service was good, but not as friendly as we came to expect at other HIE properties.  Bottom line, this hotel was just fine and came at a good price, but next time we visit Lisbon we’ll seek a more engaging experience.  Note also…",3

Reception and tour desks did not speak English so made it impossible to get any information about Phu Quoc, what to do etc. Any tours we tried to book were full and would not give us information on where else we could go to book other tours.   Drinks at the bar were served lukewarm and didn't have all the ingredients for cocktails. Hotel in general had zero atmosphere.   The beach is nice and so is the pool and the rooms. If you are looking for something where you don't want to leave the hotel and don't mind crappy food - then I suppose this hotel would be OK.   Highly disappointed.

The pool is not heated so too cold to use in April even on warm days.  The location is excellent. It is opposite the Casa Mila and a couple of minutes walk from the Casa Batllo.

I was given information on the program of the hotel and based my bookings in the various restaurants on this but it had been changed when I pointed this out I was told by reception ( she didn’t even look up at me )they sometimes changes this. No apology or further explanation if you are a solo traveller entertainment in restaurants is very pleasant as in music or nice views  Thank goodness for Med and Basílico restaurants the food and staff where so nice and professional  Will try teatro in Porto next year",3

I'm sad our stay wasn't all I hoped it would be, and so I'm hoping Volkshotel can make changes to avoid the same happening to other guests in future:   We checked in and were double booked with another guest - we walked in on him when we first keyed into our room.

They offered us 100 bucks of the $1,108 we paid for the room. The rooms are very small, not worth the money.

The bedroom has a washbasin in it and the shower and loo and in two different locations in the room. Weird. We asked for a turn down whilst we were out in the evening. Got back and our wet towels were on the floor and 2 dry towels put on the bed! The food and drink were very expensive. We would avoid W hotels in the future.

Then I was charged twice for my room so I called and was told I'd have to speak to the manager. I've called multiple times a day for a week straight (at the times the man tells me the manager will be there) and each time I get the response that he'll be there that night or the next morning, and ""I'll let him know you called"".

For example, mine had a king bed and 2 bunk beds, and could easily have accommodated a 5th bed too.  My only gripe is the lack of USB outputs on the sockets.

Then, we send an email to their hotel customer services with a screenshot of the lower price, and got a rude reply (without any apologize) to ask us contact their SPG customer service line for further assistance. They just throw out the issue that the hotel couldn't change or manipulate my reservation, but ironically, another SPG hotel just simply adjust their price and even give me extra discount for my whole reservation.

Instead of offering apologies, she was quick to revert the blame on us and instead of out-rightly offering some way to pacify the situation on her own, she had to ask, ""do you want me to give you credit for one day of your stay?"" I was not looking for a free…",1
5874,"Considering that this hotel is part of a chain that is known for its luxury and quality, I would advise the management of Corinthia to do something about upgrading this hotel.   The staff are great, professional, courteous, very helpful and sure do make you feel welcome however, the building smells like it’s been standing for a thousand years, it has a stench that is akin to a drainage pipe being broken.  We stayed on the 12th floor, our room had breath taking views, it was clean, spacious but could do with better or more like newer furniture.  The staff at the Spa were also quite nice and helpful however, their facilities need upgrading, urgently.   ",3
5875,"Very good hotel in Amsterdam, near the airport. To go to the center of the city you have to take the tram 19. In about 15' you will arrive to the Rijst Myseum. The rooms are small, modern and clean. Very productive because they use only one person as the Concierge and also to give you a key for your room. There is a big problem they don't accept American Express. Only visa. I don't like this because is a monopoly of the banks. It shoud be competition! The tram service is excelent, and cheap. You can ride 24 hs for €7,50. The Hotel don't change your bills. Lousy service. I do not recommend this hotel. To many hurdles. Beside the distance and the lack of service. They should imorove a lot for the money they charge. The only good part is breakfast",3
5876,"There are many things to like about the hotel but when I am paying €1,000 per night, I do not expect a cracked bathroom mirror, rust all surrounding the mirror and sink, mould around the toilet flush and shower controls and peeling paint in the bedroom. Paid another €120 per night for an extra bed for my daughter and it was so uncomfortable, she moved the mattress to the floor. There was a nice orchid in our room but after 5 nights, the  flowers had all died and it was not replaced or removed. The pool and pool area were very nice except for the music which was too loud. My daughter and I had spa treatments and these were amazing; best thing about the hotel. However in the gym, a bottle of water cost €5 but was free in the rest of the hotel. The staff on the whole tried to…",3

Firstly, I got an email from them asking what time we were planning to arrive at the hotel. We always get the same exact room. It’s noted on our account and these reservations were booked last AUGUST. I emailed them back and said we would be there at noon. They replied back saying they would try their hardest to have the room cleaned.  We get there around 1:30, the room, according to them, was not ready. I told them about the email and the room was magically done.. within seconds. So we go to our room and immediately we know it’s not our usual room.

The staff at the reception and Bar were very welcoming, friendly and could not have been more helpful. It was  a pity that the restaurant staff were so negative; ANYTHING seemed too much trouble. Shown to a table , well away from the other guests, we were obviously in the way and were certainly made to feel it; our presence in a fairly quiet restaurant was a bit of a chore  for the wait staff. we were offered a bare table ( quite sticky and almost outside of the restaurant). so we asked for a tablecloth - just like the…",2

When you come out of the station the hotel is quite easy to spot as it is well lit with a big sign on the roof. The main square is about 30 minutes' walk away, or you can catch the metro although this will involve changing lines.  There is not much in the way of cafes, shops or restaurants in the immediate area and we spent most of our day in the main part of the city, just using the hotel to sleep.

The worst for me was to cope with the musty smell, as they did not  want to give me another room. The food was okay. I ordered a  room-service and got the worst chicken during my time in Brazil: overcooked, dried and tasteless! The breakfast buffet was correct.  The wireless was great. Taxi service too. Lovely staff at the front-desk. Staff in the restaurant needs to smile and be more helpful.   It was honestly a really bad experience that I will not recommend to anyone. Nevertheless, the hotel is very well located, but management needs to improve the services and renovate the building.",2

The location isn't quite as good as some others we have stayed in in Barcelona but it is within easy reach of most of the main attractions, about 15 minutes from Placa Catalunya and the Rambla. Very good range of food at breakfast and the restaurant has quite a good selection for other meals. The safe in the room is charged for, unless you book directly with the hotel's own website.Didn't use the pool as we were too busy exploring Barcelona and Catalonia (even though this was our 3rd visit to Barcelona). The glass of cava on arrival was a nice touch.",4

I had to argue and speak to the management to get moved to the room we paid for and they acted like they were doing a favor of some sort. We had to ask the housekeeper for them to mop the floor with a CLEAN mop because after she cleaned on the 2nd day the room reeked of urine. Upon checkout even though the room was prepaid for they charged for the room again! I had to call to have them correct the bill and when I asked why I would be charged again they had no answer. Also they said they had no Hilton honors floors even though they are reflected in photos. No one wants a vacation where you have to constantly nag and argue about getting what you…,1
5889,Not the price but the hotel itself. Where to begin. The couch was crooked because something was broken. We didn't sit on it plus the stains on it made me uncomfortable. The bathroom is large with a deep tub with jets but no plug to fill with water. The towels looked used and weren't even hung properly. The TV didn't work right and the light next the bed didn't work. No door on the closet. Elevator didn't work when we arrived but the staff didn't tell us. Room is large and I understand older but this room looked like it hadn't been updated in years. We still spent $200 for this dump. So in San Francisco I guess you get what you pay for...😐,1

I meant get the facts before made accusations. The only thing I was happy they upgraded my superior room to premier suite for free. Rooms also so smell, foods just okay, staffs are not keen when I put knife and fork cross on plate and put napkin on the chair they'll clean table straight away, they don't understand that meant  I'll come back to table.

Rooms are in need of maintenance (loose faucets, etc) but do not look bad in appearance.",2

The first thing we had to do after arriving the room was to fix the toilet. The shower had poor water pressure and the shower head was placed very low on the wall, resulting in mild back pain from bending your body backwards when cleaning hair.   Noisy area and noisy air condition.   The streets around the hotel are not pleasant after dark. A lot of drugs and homeless people.

We are paying AUD$150 per night and would expect to get basic items in a place that charged this much. There was no soap in soap dispenser, 1 1/2 rolls of toilet paper, no toiletries that you usually get at all hotels. Beach towels were just small bath towel, no glasses just small coffee mug, they only supply 2 miniature bottles of water, when they didn’t restock we called reception and they said we only get 1 bottle each for the 3 says staying???? WTF?? So we used one of their bottles of water which was AU$6!!! The breakfast is pretty bad! They didn’t have glasses for juice, when we asked for a glass they refused to give? They said they don’t give glasses at breakfast just small coffee cup??? We asked for wine glasses and that was an issue as well???? No robes, no tissues, bed linen looks 20 years old! Only 1 pillow each so had to ask for another. Tv was completely untuned so had to try and work our ourselves and it is in Vietnamese so took forever.

It is primarily for the younger traveller and has reps around informing you of daily and nightly activities.

Food was hit and miss. Some nights ok but most nights awful. We ate out few nights in local restaurants. Breakfast was same every morning except for egg choice, fried or next morning poached. By 5th day I had just had enough of same breakfast. Lunch was by the pool bar and again repeative but probably the best meal of the day. Again we ate out few days.

Very strange that after all the previous comments about unfriendly staff going back many months that this issue has not been dealt with. Also very strange that you would put someone like this on the front desk in the first place.  The aircon system is poor and is inadequate to deal with the heat of Lisbon.

5929,A wonderful place to stay in a fantastic light cation. The rooms are sleek and modern and the staff is extremely professional. The only flaw is the food. Eat elsewhere and enjoy the amenities of this great hotel. ,4
5930,"I stayed with my boyfriend for 3 nights in a private room, the room was big, bright and clean. The staff were incredibly helpful, on arrival we were given a welcome coffee or beer and the lady at reception sat with us to show us where the hostel was in relation was to landmarks and told us some other nearby places that were worth seeing. A great stay overall that was a lot cheaper than a hotel but just as good!",5
5931,Hotel is in an excellent position and is rather traditional decor with a number of interesting clocks and artefacts.. The continental breakfast was good and staff were helpful and pleasant. The stairs are very steep but posed no problem for my wife and i with a small suitcase..It's worth pointing out if you are not too agile this is not the hotel for you ..But being in Amsterdam this is the original style of hotel . It's the bedroom i have a problem with ..They are very tired and the mattress is too soft .They really need updating ..After all it is Bed and breakfast ..And these two items are important. The furniture is old and had been revarnished a number of times ..The mattress was really poor and to make matters worse had a plastic undersheet ..We have mattress protectors on…,3
5932,Just returned from our first visit to Paris. Hotel Passy Eiffel was recommended by a friend.  The hotel was lovely. Our room was very large. The staff was friendly and helpful. This hotel was centrally located and allowed us to walk to many famous sites. ,5
5933,"The Hotel is a Place to be if you want to experience something fabulous !  The arrival was a big surprised as i got an upgrade to an amazing Suite (Big Thank You).  The Suite was mind blowing, combining Luxury with advance technology creating a unique experience.  The Food is a delight and the service excellent.  The Spa is a retreat in itself, the pool is amazing and the team lovely!  Thanks to Anne, Gerald and Brice from the Management Team.   Had an unforgettable Stay !  Strongly Recommended !",5
5934,"Will start with positives and in this instance the bellstaff and doorstaff were outstanding! And it's very centrally located.  As usual Westin and SPG never cease to amaze..And now for the rest of my experience...Checked in this afternoon with my girl and our dog. Surprised by the $67 per night parking, but such is life in downtown Chicago. Check-In was SLOW as hell and we were told we had a very large upgraded room at the end of the hall. It was a supreme Jedi Mind Trick as we walked in the room and it was a standard sized room with a non-existent view (all we could do was laugh).   Then, when we decided to get a dinner reservation, we encountered a concierge who who was a combination of wannabe ""Mean Girl"" and Stepford Wife!   But here's our favorite part.. We get to the room…",1
5935,"Not too far from the airport but not good for leisure travel at all. The rooms are really pretentious and the plasma screen is as big as an Iphone. Difficult to make reservations, the staff doesn't speak English at all, and the beach (5 mins walk) is really awful, and not a place to go on Sunday unless one is really cool and well travelled.  It's far far away from the historic centre, really worth visiting, and the well publicised pool is really small and too hot! Still wondering why my friend recommended it to me...",2
5936,"We stayed at the Amrath for 3 nights over the bank holiday weekend for a mini city break... Pros  - beautiful architecture - lobby and rooms are quirky but simple and you are staying in the part of Amsterdam’s history  - locations is great - a stone’s throw from Centraal station and the red light district (!) - I’ve read reviews saying there is no air con. This is strictly true, but there is a sort of air control which meant our room felt cool when it was over 30 degrees outside - comfortable beds and clean, comfortable bathrooms - free mini bar was great - beer, wine and soft drinks - the staff in the bar/lounge were very friendly and helpful   Cons These are more operational points but sadly need to be addressed before this hotel can be rated 5* in my opinion - we got back to…",3

5938,"I booked a stay at this hotel via BA (British Airways). Due to an error at the time of booking, I managed to book only 2 nights in a club room instead of 4 nights and, when I saw the hefty price to add 2 further nights, I ended up booking the additional 2 nights in a standard double room. So, I was intrigued to see the difference between the two types of room. It turns out the difference was negligible! Our club room was on the 21st floor and gave us access to the club lounge on the 24th floor. This meant we could have breakfast either in the club lounge or downstairs in the lobby restaurant - both nice. There was also a happy hour with wine and snacks in the club lounge. Our standard room was on the 16th floor and seemed to have a little more noise from plant / machinery…",3

5940,"I very much enjoyed my stay at Hotel Lumen. EVERY SINGLE staff member I encountered had a huge smile on their face, greeted me and were all so professional and accommodating. I stayed in the room alone, bed was comfortable. Hotel rooms are small, of course, it's Paris, but you just need the room to shower and sleep, because again, it's PARIS! :) The best city in the world! I had a great stay, comfortable, clean, fantastic location. I would stay again.",5
5941,"Our stay at the Meininger was okay. The staff overall was not very welcoming, they saw us with to big bags and didn’t even bother to ask if we wanted help to get up the stairs. Some people were very sarcastic with our questions, like how to get to the subway station. The rooms are clean and comfortable which was good, the location is also good, the subway station was within a 2 minute walk. But, if can splurge a little, stay at a hotel near one of the canals. The hotel is more like a hostel, very busy, but that wasn’t a problem for us. The breakfast was disappointing, it’s absolutely not worth the money you pay for it. If you want to save money, it’s a decent hotel, but we probably wouldn’t stay there again. ",3
5942,"1. House keeping came at 9:10 AM to ask if I wanted my room to be cleaned - never have I encountered this with Ritz Carlton and they only speak Chinese ( please take a cue from W who trained their staff in basic English 2. Asked for waffles but I got pancakes for in room dining And when they delivered pancakes, no butter was provided.  3. USB cable charger next to bed - doesn’t work 4. No personal greeting when checkin despite I being a 5 time coming back to the hotel.  No cold towel nor tea served for checkin.   How is this a luxury hotel? There’s barely attention to details in their way of service  ",2

This hotel is probably the worst I have ever been...   Starting with the neighborhood: There are many, many homeless people around the hotel, I didn't feel safe, even during the day + first thing I saw at the reception was the phone number of the police department... no more words needed I guess  To sum my experience up: I booked a ""deluxe double room"" in a 4-stars-hotel and got a tiny, smelly room without a window and therefore no daylight at all. I felt like being in prison... a very expensive prison!  I immediately complained about the room, but the receptionist just said: ""The description of the room didn't say that there…",1

5945,"Finding a last-minute hotel in Paris in June is tough.  The Villathena was central and looked clean and had availability on our dates.  It was, in fact, very clean and had adequate facilities in a convenient location.  What was shocking was how genuinely kind and helpful we found the staff to be.   The folks at the front desk, most especially SAID, went out of their way to help with everything from taxis to directions and advice to recommendations on what to do with a free afternoon.  When my next reservation with VRBO went horribly wrong, AVICK spent nearly 2 hours with me helping me sort it out and find alternative accommodations in our next city.  ROSANNA at the front desk, plus the entire housekeeping crew were just as nice and pleasant as they could be.  We actually went on…",5
5946,"The staff were extremely helpful and friendly from the moment we arrived, and helped us through out our stay and before we arrived by booking airport transfers. The hotel is modern with quirky and fun decoration. The rooms are finished to a very high standard with good bathrooms, we had a large rainfall shower. Very comfortable large bed.  The hotel is in a great location to walk around exploring paris, we wish we had been able to stay for longer!",5
5947,"Even prior to our arrival (spouse and I) the hotel was prompt and courteous in answering questions regarding the stay, both by phone and email.  Our flight from JFK arrived early and we got to the hotel long before normal check in time but even so a room was ready for us.  We had reserved a suite for eight nights and was directed to 332.  It was all that we hoped for.  Just a couple curiosities for a first time traveler to Germany and the continent, they do not have wash cloths and there are no king or queen beds, just two singles pushed up next to each other.  The room was clean and tidy.  Breakfast was supplied every morning and had a wonderful variety of all the staples.  Both fried and scrambled eggs and a couple different sausages and bacon.  We did eat dinner at the hotel…",5
5948,The hotel is wonderful and centrally located. Will definitely stay here again when I return to Barcelona. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The only complaint was that the AC was extremely loud but otherwise it was a perfect stay.,4

I had stayed here a couple of years before so it was a pleasant surprised indeed. Not wanting to alert me, he booked through a third party. I know, mistake. As I am Gold SPG he didn’t want to spoil the surprise. They first said they had no record of us and we were potentially out of luck. Luckily, I was able to access the email from the third party and when we proved we had a reservation we were “granted” a room. When we arrived I had them use my SPG AmEx and gave them my SPG number, yes, I have their card too and although I knew that we wouldn’t get a meal, nights or points credits except for incidentals, have never had the experience of…",1
5950,"When entering the room, it felt freezing cold. Even with the heating turned up, it was chilly until morning. The window was not properly sealed and cold wind came through it, could be felt on the floor. Covering with shades did not help. Bathroom floor was also only partially warm, most of it was cold. Shower head didn't stay in place and was full of crust/scale.   I specifically requested a 2 person, separate bed, room, but it was still a room with one big bed",2
5951,"We stayed at this hotel for two nights at the beginning and end of our tour of the golden triangle.  Unfortunately neither occasion lived up to its 5-star billing.  On the plus side the Indiyaki restaurant was excellent and we thought reasonably priced.  However, our rooms were tired (dirty shower curtains, cracked wall tiles, peeling wall paper, inefficient air conditioning....I could go on) and the breakfast experience was extremely poor.  The 'hot' buffet was lukewarm at best, table service was non-existent until we complained to the duty manager, and there was a long wait at the cook-to-order counter.  In short, this hotel needs a complete overhaul.  Until that happens it will not represent value for money and we could not recommend it as a destination in New Delhi.",2
5952,"I visited Berlin for three days and decided to stay away from downtown where the hotels were a bit cheaper.  This hotel is 7 stops (on U-Bahn 8) at Boddinstrasse from the Alexanderplatz station, one of the key stations in Berlin's rail network.  The hotel was very clean, the rooms were good-sized and the food was surprisingly good for a hotel.  It is also located very near Tempelhoff Feld (former airport), which on the weekends becomes a ""people's park.""  Walking to Tempelhoff Feld one also passes by some great neighborhood restaurants.  The room was quiet even though I faced the main road.  For price, convenience to downtown and comfort, it was well worth the stay even if you plan to tour around the city.",4

While negotiating terms of the wedding block, were were told (in writing) that the bride and groom's suite would be upgraded if there was availability.  We were ultimately placed in a small suite with windows facing an alley.  It was hard to believe this was the ""Deluxe"" King Suite we book, yet the upgrade we were told we would receive upon availability, but after mention to the bellhop, he took care of the issue and made sure that we got upgraded to an awesome suite.  Kudos to him.   The major star deduction comes from how the staff handled an incident after the wedding. One of our wedding guests helped bring back a few of our personal items from the wedding…",1
5954,"Worst hotel stay ever....The are definitely overcharging for the type of service they offer. The hotel manager is usually not there, so you have to talk to somebody that works for the building (not the hotel). That includes leaving your keys when you check out. They don't store your bags after your check out. Everything is weirdly informal. The entrance to the building is also weird. My room was decent, but view to the inner part of the building (meaning, to the other rooms, not exciting).",1
5955,"Stayed at the hotel for a business trip as it was one of the hotels suggested by my company.  The staff at the reception was not very kind and sometimes with a bad attitude. They definitely don't do much to go the extra mile to serve their guests. In particular, the guy working there in the morning was not able to provide me information about services included in my reservation which were mentioned on the website (City Sightseeing tour bus, ""Stay Wanderful"" rewards, etc), which made me think the information on the website is misleading. The guy working there in the evening was not very kind during checkin, and refused to provide me with a copy of the checkin document he asked me to sign. Also, when I asked him for the suitcase I left at the reception, he almost threw that at me.…",1

Showers have some serious problems too Breakfast was very typically Brazilian and the lady who was tending to it was doing it very well.

However: ""The Mountain View"" was 50% farmland, 25% construction next door, 25% hills with a concrete factory. The reception spoke low to none english. Even the simplest questions was incomprehensible to them.  Worse, when I went to reception in the evening, a man in the couch gave me a radio, so I could speak with a receptionist... only when I insisted on speaking head-to-head with a receptionist, they decided to appear after a while.

Wifi is poor and to be honest so is the welcoming. The receptionist was not interested in trying to help in anyway and our safety deposit box was broken despite us asking for it to be fixed. The showers are very nice but with poor pressure.  I would not recommend this hotel. ,2

Also location makes it great for getting into city centre.  Self serve check in. Very easy and quick.  Large hotel with a bar and restaurant.  Mixed reception from staff.

I've sat here after checking in for over 2 hours, watching as everyone in line gets their key cards.  When asked how long, I was told as soon as possible by the front clerk.  Apparently, you're treated as last priority if you use Priceline and all other guests will be treated first.

The manager, Anne, was very hospitable, with excellent suggestions for nearby restaurants, especially those favored by local residents. I have wondered why I would not give the Hotel Residence Quintinie a five-star rating. Perhaps because the location is a little out of the way? It's very quiet--a fine thing--and it is convenient to two stops on Metro line 12, which makes it convenient to a number of places that virtually any tourist will want to visit. And the hotel itself is within easy walking distance of a number of very good restaurants--gourmet restaurants, bistros, creperies, ethnic restaurants, takeaways ... For what it is (which is to say, not a luxury hotel), the Hotel Residence Quintinie offers excellent value.…",5

They gave me a little discount not much for a 350.00 dollar a night stay.

I would stay here again since the rooms are great, and I would just walk to the subway.",2

5992,"The hotel is located next to the station of S-bahn, which makes it very good starting point for exploration of Berlin. Also places as Branderburger Tor, Potzdammer Platz, Kurfurstendamm are within area accessible by foot, if you are fit enough. Rooms are clean and large enough. The separate WC is tiny, but bathroom is O.K. The room is equipped with minibar, electric kettle and there are some pieces of tee-bags and packs of instant coffee. Only coffee cream wasn't replenished after the first use. Otherwise everything was quite O.K. I will be happy to be there again.",4
5993,Myself and my wife arrived here on the 13th of febuary this year and it was a late arrival so we got there after half 11 at night. When we got to the desk we were told by the young man on the desk that our booking had been cancelled and there was no more rooms available and he wanted to move us to a hotel further out. We asked why the booking was cancelled and he said it was nothing to do with him. He said we could stay there for one night and move the next morning but at a charge of 76euro. We took the room as we had no choice but he did just not want to explain anything to us. The next morning we went down to reception with our bags and met a lovely woman called Bouchra who was a delight and sorted a room for us in that hotel for a little extra cost but it was no hassle for…,3
5994,"I booked a night at this hotel over a month in advance. Upon arrival, I was told that they had overbooked and I would not be given a hotel room. Not a single apology was issued. The desk manager told me I would have to stay next door at a different hotel. Fine. Unfortunately, my parking, which was discounted at $16 with the Fitzgerald, jumps to $45, because the hotel I was put in by the Fitzgerald charged three times as much. *Note this review has been edited to note that the Fitzgerald did refund me the additional incurred cost from the parking fee*. Clearly, canceling guests’ rooms upon arrival is an ongoing issue. (See other negative review on tripadvisor). Due to this and the lack of concern of the staff for having canceled my booking upon arrival, I strongly urge potential…",1

The concierge had been abrupt and unwelcoming, the receptionist had been efficient but not particularly friendly and first impressions of the room we're disappointing. Not at all the 5 star experience we had hoped for.  We apparently had a superior corner room with two windows on the 8th floor. But whilst being a reasonable size not at all opulent and apart from some basic reproduction furniture we found it sparse. The Bathroom was very small with an over-bath shower with the toilet being in a separate cubical across the small Hall. There wasn't even any tea / coffee making facilities.  The following…",3

It has a great location and setting, being only a short taxi ride from downtown, and relaxing in your own hammock in the jungle is fantastic. However, do not go with high expectations from a customer service point of view. Firstly, there is no one to help you with your bags to your room, which would be rather tricky if you were on the second floor, as we were, up rather narrow stairs, unless you have a strong other half who can carry your suitcase for you - I was lucky I did!

The Internet constantly disconnects and my room has a broken A/C, the staff has repeatedly said that they are going to fix, it's been three days.and it is still broken. I have requested a change of room with no luck. The size of the TV is a joke. Bad decision if you are traveling for business. The only think I like is the attitude of the staff, they are very receptive but I guess the management is disconnected from them.",2
6006,"Our 3-day end of April, 2014 stay was a delight. The staff was helpful, checking us in speedily and taking our luggage up. Our superior room was fresh and clean; the bathroom modern and ample. The French balconies overlooked the Rue de Pyramides, and street noise was barely audible. The breakfasts were fresh and bountiful, and the waiters gave us special attention. Tired from a full day at the Louvre, and chilled by the rain, we had dinner at the hotel restaurant, Oscar. It was excellent.  We often stay in this area, often taking the path by the church, passing by Oscar restaurant and the back of the hotel. We have had larger rooms in other area hotels, but our room was more comfortable and the space better utilized. This is now our Paris hotel of choice. The location is great,…",5

Total silence at night, so brilliant nights sleep every night. Amazing indoor and outdoor pools, breath-taking views over the ocean, beach and harbour. A tiny piece of paradise in the heart of Funchal old town. Lots of restaurants within easy walking distance, a fabulous bar with happy hour (and a half) manned by people who really know their cocktails, right next to reception - delish and delightful. On the negative side, breakfast consisted of mediocre ingredients prepared in a less than loving manner. Awful bread, tepid fried eggs with hard yolks, dismal bacon and an additional charge should I be presumptuous enough…",3

I got ill during our visit, and had to stay in the room when the rest of the family went out to see the city. On the ground floor there is a restaurang where you can by pizza, salad, yoghurt and stuff. Just perfect for me when I could not leave the buildning.

In the next 6 hours we have asked for the crib more than 5 times from different staff members and nothing happened...all we get is yes yes and nothing is done.

The room we stayed on was in the loudest part of the hotel and it was incredibly hard to sleep. The staff said, ""Oh,"" when I brought it all up to them. The breakfast buffet was free (package deal so I guess I sort of paid for it) or I wouldn't have paid for it as it was mediocre, at best. The 52 lounge or whatever was okay. Overpriced but the staff was excellent.   I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.   The location is nice though so they have that going for them.",1

Worst thing though was that our shower didn't work sadly we only found this out at 7:30am before we were due to check out that morning to go to the airport. We told reception staff as we checked out and they apologised, shame it wasn't checked before we arrived.

There are two categories of rooms in this property, premium and mid-range.  The mid-range units have sleeping rooms that face the street.  This is terrible.  The noise from the club (~ 100 meters) that begins about 23:00 and lasts until 04:00 is awful.  It simply cannot be silenced.  Another issue with these units is that the lock on the front door can almost never be opened with the key provided.  I would strongly advise avoiding these units.  The premium units that have sleeping rooms that do not face the road are nice.  They are very quiet and more comfortable than the mid-range units.  The main…",3

Breakfast costs about 10 euro and it is good, although the selection of sweets is limited. Free wifi (also in the room) and it is quite fast. There is even a small kitchen in the room. Personnel is extremely kind, prices are very reasonable. I do recommend this hotel if you visit Berlin.",4

You can easily get here from the airport or get a taxi which cost us 180 RMB.  We stayed on floor 7 in room 711. It was quite a small room, where the bathroom had no doors. It meant it wasn't very private and had no ventilation from the main room. We didn't enjoy this but I'm sure it wouldn't bother all. It was a noisy room located near the multi-story road.   Our main issue with the room was that it was incredibly hot. It was consistently 30 degrees in the room whilst we slept. The room had aircon but it wasn't powerful, it was broken for 3 days and the hotel fixed it- but all controls are in…",2

As such, the hotel is a nice building in the same safe area of SP. But the big difference with the Tryp Iguatemi is that noise levels in this hotel are much higher! Both the street noise and the noise of other guests coming back late or getting up early. It must be that this hotel has been built with much less noise insulation. If you want to have a good night's sleep, avoid this hotel !",2

It was also very well maintained each day during our stay.,5

Breakfast has very wide spread with quality food. Read many good reviews about their swimming pool and i thought it will be nice. However, very disappointed to meet some irresponsible staff at the pool that are very unfriendly and dishonest. Last nighy, there are 3 staff at that time, 1 male, 2 female. The male staff is very friendly and helpful. I told him I want to swim and he said he could help me keep my bag at the counter and offer me towel.

The rooms have two small doubles making the room feel very small and the bathrooms, while adequate, are tiny.  Our room was had a very partial sea view but faced directly to a neighboring hotel which made you feel very overlooked as it's so close. The only curtains are blackouts so unless you want to be watched by your neighbors your room is in darkness.   Air conditioning is so loud, you can't sleep with it on.   Finally, the breakfast restaurant down stairs - over rated!! Seems to be popular but i tried it. Paper plates, plastic knive and forks and over priced. Not my idea of a good breakfast, I would compare t to breakfast from a service…",2

The bartender was friendly, funny and more helpful than these so called concierges. He was the only upside.  Front desk is slow. Fitness center is dirty.",1

We had a wonderful dinner at Morton's on State and retired to the hotel again for a cocktail, hoping for a better experience. The same bartender was rude again. When we asked to use the mini bar, they had to unlock from the desk. We asked for silverware for our desserts we brought back and they referred us to the bar. LMAO!!  The rooms are small.

6036,"The rates at this hotel seem attractive, but for some reason it just doesn't offer the usual Four Seasons experience. It now attracts airline crews and cruise coaches which speaks volumes. They have installed a (permanent) sandwich stand in the lobby which doesn't feel very five star.   Beds in newly refurbished rooms are awful!   The hotel is located slightly in 'no man's land' so the management seems to have decided to cut services and corners as well as prices but it shows too much, so I won't be returning after a number of previous visits.",2

If on the other hand you object to paying $350 per night, prefer carpets that don’t come straight out of the 1970s and expect something faster than a 15 minute check in, then I would avoid this place like the plague.  In fairness, the staff (or at least the ones not on strike) were scrupulously polite and apologetic about what was going on.   ",1

It has a vast and impressive atrium which had the rather musty smell that old air conditioning units give off. We had one of the cheaper rooms but it was seriously ordinary. Stained carpet, tiny uncomfortable bed and in-room internet which didn't work. Breakfast was good. Access to the Gym and Spa was not included in our room rate with an extra US$30 being requested for one visit.",2

The hotel is right by one of the largest Christmas markets and accessibility to local stations meant it was easy to access other large markets in areas such as Alexanderplatz. The hotel staff are really friendly and we received a welcome drink upon arrival which was a nice touch.  The rooms are lovely, very large and spacious and you get a safe which is free to use as well. I would however say that for a 5 star hotel you expect the amenities to be perfect - and the bath robes were stiff and need replacing.   We stayed at the back of the hotel and therefore any sort of view was sacrificed as we could only see a wall, however I feel that as you're located on a Main Street the view…",4

We are from Peoria, IL but enjoy spending a couple weeks a year in the Windy City.  On this particular trip, we decided to give this hotel a shot.  Look at the pictures, how can you not want to stay here at least once?!  We were really excited about the trip but early in day, we experienced some setbacks.

We would go off to tour the sites and run ""home"" to be in this intimate atmosphere. And the hotel itself was beautifully appointed with everything you need, including the most welcoming young men at the front desk that helped with anything and everything. The rooms are not large, but who comes to Paris for a large room? And the air conditioning really worked, as we found out as we visited during a heat wave. I hope we can visit the Hotel Cler again and have already recommended it to friends.",5

They didnt even try to make things right, offer anything for the inconvenience, etc. I feel their nonchalant attitide is what irritated me the most. Everyone makes mistakes but they blew this off like it was nothing. No, I chose the W because I wanted to experience a high end hotel, and experience downtown chicago to the fullest.

6050,I am rating it poor for the following reasons: room size and price point. I feel like we paid too much for two nights. Charged almost double for a Saturday. Rooms have been remodeled but they are small and noisy. They provide earplugs in all rooms they said. Don't stay above the courtyard. The walls in the room we stayed in were scrapped up a bit. Maybe because they are so small not a lot of room to move around. Reminded me of hotels in New York. There was no place to put toiletries in the bathroom. I had to put things on a shelf under the tv. I did like that it was downtown and lots of nice places to eat and shop. The front desk gave us a list of places. I would visit the city again but stay at a different place. ,2

Literally like 10hrs later, something in my mind told me to go confirm it as we hadn't paid or anything, and I thought maybe we needed to up front? Jokes. ""There's no tour tomorrow afternoon"". Literally messed up our plans for the next day and meant I had to return to rio city a day early to fit in the things I'd miss out on that day. Got given completely incorrect metro instructions to the stairs. Was so lucky not to have thrown away the instructions of another girl who was staying…",2
6053,"We made our way to Barcelona from San Sebastián with a stop in Madrid and landed in the middle of a busy but convenient central location, walking distance to shops, Cathedral, El Baric, food and La Rumblas. The hotel was fantastic and so were the staff. Attention to detail was the order of the day and they made us feel very special and welcome. Initially we had a very noisy room, but after speaking with Raquel, the manager we were quickly changed into a less noisier room. Javier and Carlota were very good with their clients on the terrace , service with a smile at all times. The hotel should employ more staff like this. The only concerns I have were that there were no umbrellas for shade on the terrace where the seats were. The other concern was that their staff had long sleeve…",4
6054,"We booked a room for two different periods, and the experience was contradictory.  The first night we were not able to stay at the residencial, because at our arrival the owner told us that the room was already booked. The owner told us that we were late (but it was only 19:00, and there was no check-in limit) and that they gave the room to other people. They offered us a room in another residencial and drove us there. However, the proposed solution was quite acceptable, even though not of the same quality.  The second time, however, they ""accepted"" our reservation. The room was very nice and colorful, clean, with comfortable bed.  They say there is a ""public parking lot"", which means ""you can park your car along the road: some spots are public and free"".",3
6055,We were recommended Le Canberra and booked a very nice room with a fairly large terasse. Very modern rooms - a little small as many French hotels but very comfortable. The saff is very friendly and helpfull. The buffet breakfast is just superb.  So we really recommend this central located hotel!,5
6056,"Overall this is a solid hotel that delivers on most things. Not sure it warrants a 4 star rating as parts of the hotel are not as modern as others.   Just be aware that there is a large hotel being built 200m away. See pictures below.   Good points ;  1. Excellent location between Lido and Old Town.  2. A breakfast that delivers an excellent range of foods from cereal to a cooked breakfasts, all of which are vital for that all important strong start to the day.  3. Hotel overall is clean, well decorated and staff are helpful, polite and well presented.  4. Modern pool and reception area which looks great.  5. Great balcony on the 6th floor providing the ideal location to sink a fresh crisp lager beer.  6. Comfy beds, ideal for a great nights sleep.   Points for improvement;  1.…",3

Don't stay here if you care about staying in good hotels. ",2

We were told the bar shut at 12pm but we went for a drink at 1030pm to be told the bar was shut, if the man was polite and not so assertive we may have been a bit more understanding of them shutting early, but after travelling and only just arriving it would have been nice to just chill out without someone being so assertive.  When we wanted to check out the lady behind the desk deliberately ignored us and went to the couple behind us without saying anything. Generally the place was clean and tidy and the breakfast was good, but the staff were rude.",3

What we had was the tiniest bathroom I have seen in a hotel, no storage for anything, an odd smell, a super firm mattress, a noisy bed frame, end tables that were falling apart and had sharp edges that cut my phone charger, black out drapes that let all the light possible in, and lastly air conditioning/heating that you could not use comfortably overnight. As you don't get a temperature gauge, where it will auto shut off...No, you get an AC/off/Heat and that's it.

6070,The place in located right in the heart of the city close to everything and yet quiet and peaceful The service is impeccable and the breakfast sublime. The one thing they need to fix is the amount of stairs you have to climb to check in - to get to the elevator - to get to the breakfast room.  Actually the stairs to the breakfast room are not the problem - it is the stairs to the lobby when you carry a 55 lb suitcase and a briefcase fully loaded. and then down the stairs to elevator and upon exiting the elevator up a flight of stairs to the hallway to your room.  I wonder what handicapped people would do. For the rest all is great here.....,4

6073,My friend and I stayed here for two nights while in Barcelona for a girls trip. The rooms were clean and modern. The beds were comfortable and we had good lighting in our room but the hallways are dark (intentionally so). The showers were great although the hotel conditioner was awful (not to be unexpected). The roof was nice and quaint and the little pool is nicer in person than the picture shows. I love the location because it was not right in Las Ramblas but easily accessible to everything and felt a bit more like a neighborhood. The TV had plenty of channels including BBC world news and CNN which was great to watch since we were in Barcelona right after the election and during the general strike. This gets me to my only complaint- although the women at the front desk were…,4

The enthusiasm was palpable, the competence was high and the work product was excellent. For instance the rooms were spotless, and the person in charge of the breakfast had pride in her work. We were early on check in but were given a precise time when our room would be ready. We were also given specifics on how we could spend the hour, which felt personal. The location of the hotel just off Passeig de Gracia was a treat. The convenience and access to transportation was excellent.

One of them even helped us figure out some of the settings on our rent car. As for the hotel it self.  It is charming and cozy with comfortable rooms.  It is located in a quiet neighbor hood with fantastic restaurants and convenient metro and bus stops.  We choose this hotel because of an earlier review commenting on how excellent the wheelchair room is.  It to find wheelchair accessible hotel rooms in Paris and this one was quite nice. I will be staying here next time we come to Paris,5

Very near a lot of tram stops, and just 4 or 5 stops away from Dam Square and Amsterdam Centraal respectively.  The Museum Square is two blocks away, and all the luxury stores are a street away.  2.  Room had a ref and coffee/tea/still water were replenished every day.  And now for the cons:  1.  The hotel is not well maintained. The carpets in the common areas were almost filthy.  2. Our room was sooo dusty. Even after we reminded the front desk to have our room vacuumed while we were out, housekeeping didn’t do a good job at it.  3. Speaking of housekeeping, they do not do a through job of cleaning. I felt they just made the bed and…",3

Cheap price cheap quality, our fault.",2

What a great location. 10 minutes walk to the Sagrada Familia, 2 minutes to the Metro and 2 minutes to the Hop On Hop Off bus tour. Staff are excellent. Very friendly and informative. We had a two bedroom apartment. We ended up using the smaller bedroom towards the back of the apartment and away from the street which we found a bit noisy. This was however after staying at a very quiet Villa on Ibiza. The kitchenette is well provide for, there are supermarkets and bakeries close by. In fact it is a great location if you want to self cater or eat out. There are lots of small good restaurants close by. We would definitely stay at this location again.",4

When we called, we were asked if we left the do not disturb sign on, as though we were idiots. We said no, we put on the make up room sign.  The concierge was as good as the internet booking service.

Staff on front desk have been extremely polite and helpful. At start I got an upper bad (which In kind of hate). I asked for a change and the guy didn't even asked the reason, just swipe me.

Eco option on room cleaning chosen - they were supposed to come in on 3 rd night to clean room/change linens but no-one showed up.

Gym room is ok for 2-3 people same time. Breakfast is quite good (only fish was missing). Restaurant is not bad except management style - they do not serve you, they dictate you the rules you should follow.   If you're getting executive room (9th floor) - you should expect WiFi problem up to not working at all. Reception doesn't care (or doesn't know how to react), so you may need to have your skype / whatsapp calls on the lobby area.  Location - 20 minutes taxi drive to Park of Nations. During summits - better to use train.",3

Toilet room was small, but served it's purpose... We had a little terrace with table and chairs, which unfortunately we didn't get to use because it was too cold in winter. Not in the city center, but what's important is it's near the metro station.. There's also a bakery and convenience store just a few mins walk away.  I'm not sure if the rooms in the upper floor without terrace are bigger. If it it's all the same size, better to avoid bringing large luggages as space is very limited. I would be willing to stay here again though because of the cleanliness, comfort and pleasant staff.",4

It was gross.  I asked to change rooms and the second room was on the second floor. Really small, dark and it smelled like mildew. I guess it was better than feet.  The room was old, dark and hard to walk around in because everything was so close to each other.  The tv didn’t work well and some channels only had audio and no video.  Because it was the second floor, I could hear everything. The street noise was really loud.   The only pro is the bed. Thank god for the bed.  Other than that, it was an old hotel and I’m never staying there. ",1

Our outdoor space was also not even remotely private.  We could see a few other outdoor spaces from ours, which was on the walkway.  We did not use our outdoor space at all because of the lack of privacy, which basically meant the fantastic caldera view went to waste because the window in our room was fairly small and it was also on the walkway.

There's only one very large pool and not enough chairs to accommodate everyone. No adult pool. The room was large but mediocre. Bed was creaky and the AC sounded like a constant lawn mower.

A slow unresponsive and unmotivated staff, from the pool towels (where you have to fill a form and sign it before you can take a towel) to housekeeping where they left us without waste baskets for two days.

Definitely not the way to talk to your guests. It was just first time and his behaviour was below par.,2

Private beach is a card ride away and not great either.  Breakfast is rather average, we have seen better ones in Vietnam.  Motion rendered lights in bedrooms were super annoying and triggered by moving a toe. Tv didn't work either. Staff didn't speak English and didn't want to help at all.

There were a few things that I felt were a bit lacking in terms of customer service and overall furnishings with the apartment (i.e. cord for the kettle was a bit short, no extra chair/table for my belongings in the second guest room of the family suite).

It's served in the main bar/lounge area of the hotel and get's very crowded.   It's a continental selection and very poor at that. No toast, eggs etc. The put everything on large trays which sit onto of the bar counter meaning that everyone is trying to get in to choose what they'd like from a tiny, tiny worktop.

6114,"Booked for a work trip. The residence I booked was a 1 bed apartment but I was allocated a 3 bed apartment which was a 200m walk from the reception area. This would be quite tough if you needed help with your bags.   Apartment was clean but cheaply built. Balcony door didn't lock as lock had been installed incorrectly.  Furniture was cheap, worn and not in keeping with the brand - uncomfortable, Badly designed apartment. Constant hum from some machinery through the building which was unnoticeable during the day but very obvious at night. shoddy workmanship on the fixtures and fitting. i.e. paint on the carpets from where they have painted the walls after the carpet was laid, loose taps etc.  I wouldn't stay there again.",2

But: -Staff attention is really bad -Price is very high -No free Wifi at rooms(and is very expensive) -Small rooms, awful view and you can hear everything that happens in the rooms nearby. -Room service will charge you $40 extra per dish  Wouldn’t stay at the hotel again.",2
6117,Couldn't have a better located hotel. 1 train straight from the airport to the station and hotel right there. Brandenburg gate and the Reichstag not even a 10 minute walk away.  Highly recommended.  Easy to get wherever you want with 24hr trains at the weekend.  Will definitely be back.,5
6118,"A short break to Madeira found us staying here, about a 25 minute walk from Funchal centre.  The hotel on the whole is good, what you would expect from a 5 star holiday type hotel. The real let down was the main restaurant, it was just such a drab place, straight lines of tables. Tables for 2 by the windows and tables for large groups gradually working towards the back wall.  Whilst this may be more practical, the result is that it just seems like a canteen, it could be so much nicer.  The hotel does also attract a more mature guest, quite mature!",3

There is STILL no tea/coffee/kettle facility provided in the rooms, despite seemingly numerous complaints on TripAdvisor regarding this. The toilet flush in my bathroom was broken, which I managed to fix myself. When I did ask for a kettle and coffee cups (thank goodness for Starbucks Via in my bag!), a kettle arrived without the cups - these then took another 20 minutes to arrive after further prompting. The next day I asked for an iron + board (not provided in the rooms), waited 30 minutes, called again, and they arrived 20 minutes after that.  There was renovation/construction work…",2

We had a great surprise. We stayed in the room called Capricieuse, I think it's a superior room, and it deserves to be. Fantastic bed and sheets, good shower, big LED TV with plenty of channles (but you won't care about it in Paris). Very good location, 1 block from the montparnasse tower (don't miss the sunset there), near 3 metro stations and a great and nice staff. Points to improve, case the administrators read it. 1) The minibar doesn't work well in a closed cabinet.

The only reason I am not giving it one star is because the staff was always very kind. Every time you turn the tv on in your room, you are forced to listen to the owner of the Diamond timeshares go on and on about himself and the hotel. He actually prides himself on how immaculate his properties are and says there won't even be dust on the top of the door hinges. I had to look, and yes, there is dust there. If you are going to make us listen to you about how awesome your property is, make sure it is awesome. This place is outdated, lobby glass rusted roof leaking, their activities are pretty lackluster also. We called ahead to ask…",2

The hotline staff said the time for servicing the room was random. Chambermaids have till 5pm to clean the room, which I find unreasonable. If the room is to be serviced only at 5pm, why service it at all. What is the difference between this luxury hotel and Airbnb?  Nevertheless I was assured by hotline staff my insistence to have the room serviced immediately will be attended to. But I had to call two more times before my room was cleaned. Not till 3pm. I was exasperated.",1

The breakfast buffet is attractively laid out, comprehensive, with fresh ingredients. I look forward to coming back. ",5

Aircon doesn't work. No porters, night staff rude. Nothing to do in the area.",2
6129,The staff was nice and I was thankful that we could check in at 9:30am after our 13-hour flight.  The room was large and we were happy to have seating area. The beds were so comfortable and we could have great sleep after long-haul flight from Asia. The location was excellent! We could not only walk to many famous points but also the subway station just next to the hotel. My room was just near the road with some noise but it would be fine if the windows were closed.  I highly recommended this hotel and I'm sure to stay when I visited Berlin again.,4

The room was below not only 4-Star hotel Standards or W Hotel/Starwood standards, but also the standard for what I would expect in any safe hotel room.  Our room was missing a safety latch.  I have stayed in plenty of hotels, and this was a first.   At check-in (after 4:00 p.m.), our room was not ready.  This was pretty irritating.  When we got to the room, it was (1) missing a safety latch, and (2) had a large crack in the wall.  We requested another room, but were told that no rooms were available.

The hotel is good - comfortable, reasonable rates, mostly good service, outstanding breakfast.  We recommend it.",4
6139,The location was perfect for our needs. Having had stayed in Paris previously we wanted to explore a different area and this hotel was great.

The contact and suggestions from the hotel was fantastic and recommendations provided helped make our stay even better.,5

We tried to check in early but they said they didn't have our room ready. We returned and checked in only to find the cleaning lady still in our room. We had a dinner reservation and were planning on getting a drink before the reservation in the lounge. No one was in the dinning area but the bar was full. We asked to sit outside and the waitress said that would be fine since we would be there for just a few minutes. She said to order a drink from the bar. At the bar we were not greeted by anyone. Five employees walked by us. I finally had to ask for a menu. The bar tender gave it to me but didn't say anything. They…,2

We arrived later in the evening and checked into room 307. The hotel is definitely trendy…the room was clean and laid out well for the space they have except for the bathroom. The sink wasn't very comfortable to use with limited counter space and as you try to wash your face you hit the mirror. Being on the third floor we were a little concerned about street noise but it didn't turn out to be an issue.

But the 4 seasons in San Francisco was incredibly disappointing on the following points:  1. Despite an expensive room rate, I was a in a small room with two twin beds.  I felt like I was back in college and was waiting for a room mate to arrive.  2. Hotel gym was fairly poor.  Well equipped but it's shared with the overall building (offices, etc) and not really a high-end experience.  3. Hotel bar and restaurant were ok, but very slow and disinterested service.

We went back to reception to find the Virgin rep as this really wasn't what we wanted and they did manage to sort us a room in the main building which we appreciated.

While the staff and restaurant were very good, we were surprised that our extra room fee was 3 euros higher because we had one bed, vs our friends who asked for twin beds! One would think just the opposite would be the case.  In addition, their ad stated they were ""close to everything"" - not true!  We were 20-30 minutes from the city center and had to Uber to all planned tours & museums - the private car available from the hotel was at least twice the cost of Uber.

A good way of making it cosier would be to provide a small kettle and some tea, instant cofee, and herbal teas. Bathroom amenities are not of quality comparable with the rest of the hotel : shampoo, soap, and body lotion lack personnality to say the least. Contract a good cosmetics shop, guys. The famous railway running at 10m from the hotel is indeed a problem on the first floor, but much less going up. My room was on the 5th and trains were barely hearable.

Nowhere was that noted.  when we go to the room we discovered there was no safe in the room.  We asked and they put one in the room however it was not bolted down so anybody could just lift it and take it out!  Then we found there were what looked like blood stains on the comforter.

Got through to the central reservations for the company (the number on the website of the hotel) and had a very pleasant conversation, selected a room, and thought all was great... until I got the confirmation in my email and found they had booked me into Anaheim rather than San Fran/Fisherman's Wharf.  So I called to cancel (of course) and then got the runaround about whether they had space available.  I called central reservations and was told there was space available, but only for a minimum 2-day stay (I only wanted one night), but only the front desk could override.  Front desk said they couldn't override... and that their schedule showed no space.  Meanwhile I was looking at…",1

Due to the reconstruction of the seaside/harbour of Funchal it is very noisy and for people who are not very mobile it is quite a problem to walk to the town center. In the period we went there (i.e. end of May) the average age of the guests was around 70 years. Wifi works fine (you can get free wifi in the public areas and private wifi in the room at a relatively high cost). Personnel is friendly and speaks good English.",3

So simply asked if they can give us double room next day and to the best of my surprise... Reception told that they're fully booked and it won't be available tomorrow as well... and now it's time for us to loose the temper....

Our trip to Miami was planned very last minute, and unfortunately due to such last minute planning, we did not have many other choices when it came to hotels, which resulted in our family staying at a crappy, overpriced hotel like this one. This hotel is definitely not family friendly, in fact, The President hotel is not friendly to anyone, in any way. When my family and I were looking at the photos of the hotel, we could already tell that it was not anything luxurious, but it came out as nicer than other hotels in the area that were not yet booked. But what I have to warn people about are the photos of the hotel. The photos are extremely deceiving, although yes you will see the ugly green decorations…",1

If you are the type of people you look at details and you look for a restful place, this is not the hotel for you. I stayed in this hotel just because it is close to my family, not other reason. It is located at a nice neighborhood of Buenos Aires, plenty of nice stores of any kind (food, clothing, laundry, pharmacy, you name it you have it; hotel is located at a corner. The hotel IS NOT close to downtown, you need to travel by bus, subway, train or taxi to downtown.  It is VERY noise day and night, difficult to have a good night sleep, noises of any kind, buses until 2AM are passing by and trust me they are loud, and groups of people STANDING at the outside entrance of the hotel talking all the time, you will hear them a lot from your room; also a ""cartoneros"" group of people standing exactly in the front corner of the hotel are horrible to see and a little scary to pass by: I do not understand why the hotel do not complain to the Buenos Aires city police to remove them, they are disgusting.  Amenities: breakfast: it is ok for Argentinians who do not eat protein during the morning: it is pastries, apples, canned peach, cereal, coffee, tea, milk. Pastries goes away soon if you get breakfast around 9 am they do not fill the basket again, poor service about that; I consider they should serve eggs when they know it is American tourists in the hotel but they seems to do not care; I was 18 days in the hotel, every day was the same type of breakfast, the only variation was one day chocolate pound cake, another day vanilla pound cake. Bedding: bed is just ok, towels do not reach the good quality for a hotel, towels are not quite white and most of the have spots, this is the MOST I DISLIKE, poor quality and care about that. Bedroom: it has a bar with microwave and refrigerator, sink also, bathroom is ok  Average cleaning is good, service is ok, if you ask they help you but they are not about details.

The room was extra tiny but worse, the bathroom sink area was too small to brush your teeth without having to stand back to clear the walls. The sink itself was designed by someone who clearly never imagined what torture it is to actually use it.

My wife Debbie and I last went in October 2017, just for the one night (we were in Paris to see London Irish play).  The rooms are all dramatically different, each with their nown personality. It was a clever idea to have each designed by a different interior designer. We have now stayed in three different rooms and Milagros was our favourite.  The rooms aren't paticularly big but again this is quite common in Paris - old buildings have small rooms (check out the George V).

Check in was swift, the room was small with a strange corner at one side of the bed (because of the shape of the building). The bed was excellent and luckily I had a walk in shower instead of a bathtub. Breakfast was good, perfect scrambled eggs. If you need a taxi, they will order one for you that actually comes inside the lobby to pick you up.",4
6234,"I almost never comment and this would be the first. For the price you pay — almost US$700 before taxes and I’m in a suite, this is the worst service of any Ritz property I have stayed in and I have been to many. It takes several things to go wrong before a guest gets annoyed. One or 2 and you justify as human lapse but when there have been 4 over the course of 3 nights so far, it’s unexceptable for a Ritz Carlton expected quality, branding and claimed service.   The 4 quickly, I had to ask for a newspaper to be sent to my room 3 times before one actually arrived. The last straw was going personally to the front desk. 2nd, I came back from a long day of meetings past midnight and when I went to shower, there was no shower gel. There were several conditioners and shampoo ...which…",1

We had no issues concerning anything. We found it a great place to base ourselves from which to see Berlin.  There lots of stuff in the apartment that they want you to drink and eat but it's not cheap. Do they need to charge 75 cents for a nesspresso coffee pod, 14 Euro for red wine ???  I think the coffee pods at least could be complimentary.",4

Anyway, the room did not smell, since the smokers obviously went to the balcony. The rooms are modern and clean and are consistent with internal business standard. The staff was polite and very helpful. The breakfast in the attached restaurant offers a variety of food. WiFi is complementary. Parking in front of the hotel is free as well. ",4
6239,This hotel is at odds with appropriate service level. The very first experience is with valet parking which does not belong to hotel and therefore ask to be paid immediately for your length of stay(3 days in my case).Then you can forget about them as they are never there .....at 42 usd per day  Then front desk is limited to often 1 person which does not help expedite your arrival. Then you are told that beside room charge per night you will have to pay a 30 dollars charge for wifi and access to premises(beach?). This obviously is in contradiction with booking.com who indicate that wifi is free on my reservation. Looking at booking picture for the room I choose this has no relation with the one I got- On the picture it looks roomy with 2 armchairs but the one I got is very very…,1

One, however, was particularly moody. We had the pleasure of checking in with him. The biggest bummer are the mattresses. The problem ins't so much that they are rock hard (although I do prefer soft ones, and soft-medium is standard in 4-5 star hotels), but that metal wires are right up against your flesh.

The infinity pools are also very nice and relaxing.  The decor was also very impressive.  The rooms were spacious and luxurious.  The beds were also perfect, and I had a good night's rest there.  Now with the negative.  Let me start off saying that I am a seasoned traveler, and I can deal with hostels, guesthouses, and moderate hotels, BUT with 5-star hotels, I, as well as many other people, have expectations of what a 5-star hotel must have.

Having just arrived on our first night we booked to have dinner in the hotel restaurant, not realizing it was a Michelin star restaurant.

The breakfast area was entirely functional and the bar was as soulless as you could get. Lisbon is such a wonderful city yet this hotel could be anywhere in the world. If you purely want somewhere safe and comfortable to stay, the you won't go wrong. However if you travel to experience different cultures give this hotel a miss. ",3

I was then offered a meal, which had been prepared especially for me because of my late arrival. I was duly impressed (but declined because at 1.30am I was more interested in sleeping than in eating).   Unfortunately, the contrast between the stylish lobby (and beatiful efficiency and friendliness of the check in process) and the actual room was rather stark: what awaited was a decidedly small room with two small single beds that were too short, way too springy and that sagged in the middle…",2

It was some what disappointing compared to our other jet2 holidays were hotels deserved a much higher rating if this is classed as 4*,3

We are timeshare owners with a different company (VI)  and will never stay at a Diamond Resort again. I will include the pros along with the many negatives.  Reasons for choosing this property were:   Pro-Proximity to BlackRock without the $$ Pro- onsite laundry, spa,sundries store,wifi- lobby only, actually, right in front of the check in only. Our parking was included. We knew it was going to be fairly dated as far as decor is concerned, so were not as surprised upon arrival as other guests were.  Pro- 2 bedroom units, with incredible square footage, huge updated bathroom is a plus. Con- The TV is set to come on to the CEO boasting about details, details of…",2
6289,"This hotel is in a great location, centrally located to many of Amsterdam's attractions.  It's also a very good value, but there are a couple of red flags.  First is that it is multi-levels and NO elevator.  If you can request a lower-level floor, do so.  The staircase is very narrow and steep.  Secondly, I believe I found a bed bug in my bed.  Now I know that many hotels get them, these days...but I feel I should warn everyone.  Lastly, the rooms are small, but the bed was very comfortable.  Overall...not a bad place.",3
6290,"I worked through Hotwire to secure a 4 star hotel for my daughter's birthday. When we got there, it was definitely not a 4 star hotel but more like a 1 to 2 star hotel. I have travelled a lot over the years, and this was the worst hotel I've ever stayed in.  I had 4 star expecations but the rooms were small, noisy, and the bathtub had ""dripping"" water so I could not even take a bath.  I left after 30 minutes because I would not have been able to sleep there.  We were both shocked that the Tilden had a rating of 4 stars.  It was a bad experience. Beth Baldwin",1

After we checked in to the hotel (which has a beautiful lobby), we went to the room.  It was outdated, surface clean, and had a view of the air conditioning unit and a brick wall.  We were very disappointed.  We usually stay at the Sheraton Towers, Embassy Suites, or the Intercontinental.  Unfortunately Someone recommended trying the Palmer House.  We soon found out the pool is under construction!  We promised a 6 and 4 year old a pool.  We tried to change hotels and they were unwilling to let us out of our room.  We had been there less than an hour.  They told us we could take a cab or walk seven blocks to a sister hotel.  We asked to just be transferred to the other…",1

We were able to check in right away but didn’t get the room we requested.  While expensive I thought they would at least give us free breakfast the next morning but didn’t. Location was good but with limited time in Barcelona (boarding cruise ship the next day) the walk to many sites was impossible.

The fitness facility / gym was less than desired. However the sauna and steam room were fantastic. The team at reception were very accommodating and they helped us out with issues with food delivery. There is also a computer located in the lobby - great for printing train tickets etc. On a negative note - the cleaners tried to clean our rooms some mornings at around 8am, while we were sleeping. Definitely far too early to begin the rounds for room cleaning. If you haven’t paid for the breakfast buffet there is a great organic grocery / cafe right next to the hotel. However, apart from that, the food options were very limited due to the…",4

We were in a room facing La Rambla on the 5th floor and did not find it noisy at all as its well double glazed. Best book with the Hotel directly as we used Hotwire and were initially given an internal rom with no external window but paid the hotel directly for an upgrade for less of a ""shoebox"" with an external window.

Most hotels are relaxed given the temperature of the jacuzzi was luke warm. After a day of sightseeing, we weren't able to take the children for a swim due to the pool policy.

The staff were surly and disinterested.  If you walk out of the hotel toward the beach about 50 yds, there's an Italian restaurant on the front that was excellent. In terms of facilities, considering it was a 21 storey hotel, the roof top pool was 1 lane of about 15 yards.  It had the only bar in the hotel and that closed at 10 pm.  A number of snack and drink options on the menus were never available.  Although close to the beach, (one road back), its at the wrong end and we were woken up on a number of occasions with locals arguing loudly in the street late at night.  We wouldn't go there again.",2

There was no plug in the bath so could only shower. They were also grossly understaffed. We had eaten out every evening and decided to use the hotel restaurant on our final evening.

Our complaint was that we could hear EVERYTHING from the room next to us, down to the phone ringing, people walking around in heels, and a child screaming. We did complain to the front desk ,thinking they would upgrade us, but they did not. In fact, on this issue, they were completely inflexible and would not budge.

Quality/price surely worth it. ",4

My first which was on the inside of the atrium I could hear every noise from the lobby area, including the misc which was played from early in the morning to late at night. The bathroom was outdated the flush on the toiled did not work properly. The Lady the checked me in had no personality and the list can go on... Only saving grace was the bar staff who were extremely friendly and provide some good advice on restaurants and cafes.  Renovations were going on while I was there so hopefully things will improve in the near future.",2

The rooms were 'cute' but ours was damp and musty smelling presumably due to the leaking shower and plumbing problems that made the toilet smell less than fresh. I would definitely go back due to the location and hope they sorted the plumbing or we'd get a better room. ,3

Sure it is clean, the location pretty good and the staff is nice enough but for the money (not cheap by any means), I would stay many other places in SP.  Time to renovate big-time Mr. Maksoud!",2
6318,The middle aged balding caucasian man standing in front of the hotel was condescending . I asked if they any herbal tea (instead of black tea) and he was rude in his demeanor. Ironic since he is part of guest services. Then he pointed out that there was a Walgreens a few blocks down. Outside of the hotel is a gritty area and the parking was only valet and pricey. There was no complimentary breakfast either. Our room was small and basic. I have stayed at far more comfortable and accommodating hotels at much cheaper prices. Save your money and go somewhere else as there are plenty of other hotels outside of downtown San Francisco and plenty of transportation to get there. I definitely don't recommend this place.,1

A pet peeve with Holiday Inn Express is that they don't provide bottles of shampoo, conditioner or bars of soap.  Instead, there is a single built in dispenser with a liquid that is supposedly all three.  Not a fan.  Also, the pillows are very thick, both the firm and regular types.  Had a neck ache the next morning.  There is a close metro stop that goes downtown.  Beware that the ticket machine at that stop will not accept regular (American) credit cards, coins or bills.  It only takes smart chip cards.  Big pain in the neck.  Breakfast was not great but rather sufficient.",3

Compared to other Hotels in Shanghai and surrounding district there is a level of arrogance that reflects a place that probably doesn't have to work to hard to get visitors. Hence the lack of investment in updated facilities and management care to detail. Sitting at the bar is no longer a pleasant, fun, experience. The staff treat the area as a social arena and the customers as a inconvenience. The evening entertainment has gone, probably to save cost, leaving a dull and unfriendly atmosphere.

This property is not as seen in the photos at all so please do not be fooled by the angle  or photo filters displayed and spend the extra money for your health and safety. As group of 3 females travelling to  San Fran for a special trip we were dropped off at the door and had to step over garbage at the curb from the over flowing bin. This should have been red flag #1. Inside the gentleman at the desk was very rude and kept asking if we had a car, even though we said no six times. We were then charge $34.00US because when Expedia rebooked this hotel at the new price they only selected 2 staying in the room.  Our room was in a different building adjacent to the office. For this access to the second building we had to go outside and through the iron gate. The punch in the face  foul aroma of cat urine greeted us as we entered the hallway. Red Flag #2. The stairs were red carpet with stains and mushed contents in to the rug. We played guess what that is up three flights of stairs lugging our suitcases. Walgreen bags are stuck all along the banisters. The loud sounds of a construction zone were on EVERY FLOOR. there was zero mention of this at check in. The hallways on all levels were full of clear garbage bags and construction materials that we had to step over . There were wood beams with exposed wiring. When we arrived to our room the smell of cat urine was worse than in the hallway. The room had random updates such as a new headboard and a cabinet. There was a microwave and small bar fridge that looks like it is from 1970. The AC barely works in the room. The bathroom is old and yellowed tub, plus even with two people you get 1 towel...no hand towels or face cloths...just a towel. There was a large gap between the door bottom and the floor. We left immediately and on the walk out just down the street we saw a person injecting drugs sitting in a  truck.  After 4 hours on the phone with Expedia standing on the wharf because we felt unsafe and value our health we didn't go back to the hotel. We were moved to the Hotel Union as all hotels were full after speaking to 4 agents and a manager and then them never calling us back and we called again.However the manager of the Alpha refused to give us a full refund and kept 1 nights fees.  At the hotel when we got back it had the garbage in the hallway miraculously removed which was replaced by an ice bucket on the floor catching the water leaking from the ceiling.  I value the feedback of the people who post on Trip Advisor and recognize that my experience can help others that may make the booking for this hotel. I am concerned for the well being of others based on the smell and the type of construction happening in that building with no barriers or notices to the customers staying there. The health inspector should be seeing this hotel. Spend the extra $100-$150 and DO NOT STAY HERE…",1

The room is in good size and clean, full length windows facing to the garden provides good ventilation, bathroom provides hairdryer, shaving kit, dental kit, facial kit, tempo and condom. Free minibar including water, juice, soft drink, beer that being refilled daily. TV signal didn't work from time to time.   One night there were free fruits and croissants in the lobby for guests to take, not sure if they have that every night. Bar/restaurant looks nice but didn't have chance to try.   Wouldn't choose this hotel again though only…",4

Check in 2pm check out 10am.  We flew in early and room was ready. Dirty hallways (as in pictures) & lift. Building new lift atm. Clean room. Rooms so small, 2 people can't pass each other without the other backing up. Had to lay one suitcase on the couch. Large TV with Basic TV channels. Bar fridge. No desk to work on. No iron or hairdryer. What hotel doesn't have tissues? Rooms tidied everyday with clean towels (no wash cloths or hand towel). Very small toilet and shower. Coffee and tea and kettle UHT milk fridge, this is also topped up with every clean. Price is a little high for what…",2
6344,"We stayed here when we lived elsewhere and have recommended the hotel to friends, so we decided to stay here for our last night in San Francisco with our 2 cats before moving to the east coast. I checked in with the cats and signed a pet policy agreement ($150 additional fee, by the way) and went up to the room. After getting settled in and letting the cats out of their carriers the front desk called me and said they only allow dogs but not cats. I spoke to the manager and he was nice enough to waive the policy which I appreciated because I was very stressed (moving isn’t fun), but the questions remain why dogs and not cats, and what do they do with the $150? Our cats are only indoor pets and they use a litter box. Do they bring in a special hazmat team to fumigate the room?…",1
6345,I have never stayed in this part of town so I wanted to be sure I stayed in a brand hotel.  The attention to design and the execution was perfect.  Everyone I interacted with were kind and generous.  The location is central enough so that getting and from the hotel was easy.,5
6346,"Very below par service, staying in the hotel right now in room 206, asked for soup yesterday., did not show up,slept empty stomach. Today breakfast came after hour plus with that to calling multiple times, earlier stays in this place had a chat with Rajneesh the IRD manages, less than polite and unprofessional. If it was not for my companies say on staying here, would not recommend the IRD as a great service here",2
6347,"Good location for the beach which is small but lovely, good walk to the town itself. The hotel customer service was average, breakfast was average, no kids around, not a family friendly environment. Rooms were clean with all amenities but would not visit again, too expensive for what it was",3
6348,"Really nice room, clean, safe and quiet. Our room faced the front of the hotel and there was no noise at all.  Breakfast was hearty and well replenished.   Hotel is not in the center of town. It is a short cab ride ($10 Euro) or tram/bus ride away from the Reichstag, etc. I was looking for charm and this hotel delivered. Many of the hotels in Berlin seemed to be bigger, ""chain"" type properties.  Nice front desk staff and close to some cool little restaurants within a short walk.   Very happy we picked this hotel.",4
6349,"We spent 4 nights at the beginning of August at this hotel.  Best location if you want to enjoy the fun at the ramblas.  There is a grocery store just across the street which is very convenient.    Except that the bathtub was leaking, we were pleased of our stay..  We would definitely come back",4

6351,"We have just returned from our stay at the Tivoli.  The central location is very good and the room was comfortable but it took us about a day to get the hang of getting too and fro from the room, lots of different Blocks and floors and levels. The amenities were good, could do with a few more pool umbrellas.  My big gripe was when checking out we discovered we had to pay for coffee made in the room!  We assumed that coffee and tea was complimentary!  The tea was but not the coffee there was a charge of 2 Euros a pod used. If we’d known this we’d have brought our own or purchased some in a shop. I have never had to pay for coffee in a hotel room before!  We enjoyed our stay and Lagos is good to walk round and explore.",3

6354,"This is the most bizarre experience I've had at a hotel. Wrong price, given the wrong room twice, given an occupied room and had a strange amount held on my card well after checkout.  I made my reservation online and then called to confirm the price, since I was traveling for business. On the phone, the price was confirmed. I arrived and was told the room would be more than $50 more a night, which was above my per diem allowance. The front desk refused to change the price but claimed they would upgrade me. It was late so I decided to just eat the difference so I could get a bed. I'm 8 1/2 months pregnant and my husband was traveling with me for safety. I had booked one King. The room I was given was two doubles. I wasn't interested in sleeping separately and the two of us could…",1
6355,"The Miramar looks beautiful from the outside and the entrance foyer is impressive, however if you are staying in the hotel, rather than in the rooms which form part of the beautiful old colonial style building, they are pretty tired looking and along with the corridors could do with a bit of updating.  That said, the location was excellent, the pools were clean with plenty of loungers and most of the staff could not do enough to help. We would definitely recommend the restaurant Adega - amazing food with chef and staff who made the holiday for us with their warmth and generosity - special thanks to Desia!",3
6356,"Stayed for 7 days. Hotel is conveniently located near the U Augsburger Str U-Bahn station. There are 2 supermarkets with 10 mins walking time. Staff was pleasant and gave us an early check in due to a long 16hrs flight from Singapore. Requested for a high floor prior to arrival and was prearranged. Room was big, comfortable, clean and with the basic necessitates. Beddings were comfortable with 2 pillows provided. Blackout curtains could be controlled electronically next to the bedside and it was good to block off the morning sun. WiFi signal was strong. Built-in speaker was mounted around the room including outside the toilet allowing guest to plug their own smart devices to play their own music. Toilet size was alright and the water pressure from the shower was strong. Some…",4
6357,"This is just an Ibis.  Overpriced because it's in Rio and even with the low exchange rates of the Brazilian Real facing US Dollars or Euros, the hotel rates in Rio are expensive.  So you pay for a 4 star service and get a business hotel welcome and nothing else. ",2

I visited in March to do a pre-trip check before my large group traveled this summer.  I am grateful I checked even though I expected to find it in good condition.  It was no longer the bright and clean place it had been.  There was a mold issue on the ceilings of several rooms (the desk clerk acknowledged that they had been dealing with a leak in the roof and that they had plans to address it.)  There were non-guests sitting near the desk ""hanging out"" with the employee on duty.  Most discouragingly, the Red Nose has expanded and the additional rooms are not in the original building.

6360,"I have stayed at this hotel numerous times, often pleased by the general comfort that the rooms offer. Please note that this occasion has never happened before however it's one you would not expect. I'm writing in regards to the experience and the way it was dealt with and how it could of been pro-actively sorted.  My stay was overnight on a very busy, oversold weekend dated the 05/09/2015. The director of rooms who I can see uses this called to attempt a recovery and apology. However the situation was not recovered as it was not sorted.  At 00:00 hours I woke to a rattle, the air conditioning is fairly loud in this hotel as it is set on variable timings instead of constant. I woke to the sound of rattling in my room, this sound can often be caused by ice in the air…",1
6361,"We paid extra to stay on a suite on the 17th floor, we were not informed that the 18th floor was a bar. All day everyday it sounded like someone above us was opening and slamming doors, and there were people yelling at the bar till the 12-1am. We got fed up with it and asked to be moved, they told us they could give us a lesser quality room, but refused to compensate us for the difference. So in summary the only options given to us were move to a cheaper room and pay way more money than its worth, or just stay up all night listening to  people yelling, and screaming, and slamming doors. There are many other hotels in Chicago, that offer far better service than this one, save your time and money and go somewhere else.",1
6362,"Stayed here for four nights as part of a mini-Europe tour. Hotel was very clean, staff very polite & helpful. Great location - quiet enough - but also 5 minutes walk to nearest S-Bahn station. Public park and lake also within 5 - 10 minutes walk.   On the downside, the room could have benefited from air conditioning (Berlin was very warm when we visited), the room was small, but adequate, however the bathroom was tiny and the shower cubicle (for me) was a real cursing point.  My biggest gripe though was that there was no free WiFi, the other three hotels we stayed in (Krakow, Vienna & Venice) all provided free WiFi. I feel that it is something hotel residents should expect these days when staying in a decent hotel. (there was a Mac computer available in the foyer, but it was…",4

More of an apartment block.   The area was slap bang in the middle of backpacker heaven, but too extreme at some points during the day. For the size of hostel the social area wasn't the biggest.  Shout out to Lockie for all his advice about travelling north. We initially intended to travel south but he change our minds and we're thankful for that.",2

It's a little bit away from the city centre but it's really easy to get into it. We caught one bus M46, it took about 30 minutes to reach Berlin centre.

The hotel has amazing rooms, very spacious and comfortable - all the amenities of  a luxury hotel with the comforts to make you feel like your ‘home’   It’s a great mix or a restaurant, bar, cafe - with great rooms   Highly recommend a visit!

6369,"Fantastically underwhelmed by the property. The website does not reflect the property as it actually is. Standard not up to par for high level business trip this week. The high level official was checked into a room that was already occupied, the sales department made a mess of the method of payment, no business center, no need for front desk clerk to flirt while checking me in, the waiter in restaurant unacceptably rude to our table, and the property is in dire need of renovations. The front desk managers were helpful in resolving issue after issue. ",1
6370,Very good location and the breakfast service. Bed was very big and confortable..Bathroom was satisfactory. Our room was at the fourth floor which was newly refurbished. But the restof the floors are not. Dont think to use the pool it is somewhat kind of pool for kids. Noise isolation and the elevators need to be improved. Front desk was very helpfull. Very close to the La Rambla.,4
6371,"The hotel is very close to Alexanderplatz, very close to public transport (bus, train and subway). The hotel is within walking distance of many sites, each of which is mentioned as a must visit. The hotel and rooms are very clean. Breakfast is very good. The staff is very services. The disadvantages I find in the hotel are: there are stairs inside the room, and there is no safe inside the room. Overall the hotel is very good, and definitely gives good value for the money. It is highly recommended for those who came to visit the city and looking for a good place to sleep at a reasonable distance from the visit sites and public transport.",4

The 9th Arrondisment is a lively area with wonderful restaurants, cafes and shops.   The hotel staff were friendly and helpful (one night they booked a restaurant for me).  They gave me a very useful map and suggestions for local restaurants and shops.    The room were clean and comfortable and the hotel is  creatively designed with artwork in the room and public areas.

Unfortunately the front of hotel is under construction, guest room terrible and disgusting (it also smells like chlor and something death), no housekeeping during our 2 nights and the elevators noise.. can't recommend it!

Everything seems to be designed to offer a cheaper and downgraded experience.

However, we experienced several issues that made our stay unpleasant.   1 - The keys kept on becoming deactivated. Having to go back to the front desk at least 10 times was a huge annoyance.  2 - The wifi was spotty and would work, and then go down. Again, many trips to the front desk wasted time and energy.   3 - The front desk was small and always had a line.   4 - The breakfast was so-so. The eggs were dry and there wasn't enough fresh fruit.   5 - There was street noise, but to be expected in the heart of SP.   This hotel is a nice business traveler hotel but needs to work on the little things.",2
6381,"My mum and I regularly take short breaks in Europe and often look for hotels with no frills on the outskirts of cities such as this. We don't expect lots of extras and gushing service, but we do expect the rooms to be clean, the place to be comfortable and facilities in working order. Unfortunately this wasn't the case with the Rixwell Gertrude. The staff were not friendly and welcoming and we found this throughout our stay - no one was bothered about good service. On arrival, we found the fridge in our room was broken. This should be checked when each guest leaves as it has items for the minibar in it, so not acceptable to be broken on our arrival. There was a circuit board hanging out of the top of it, so it was quite obvious to anyone looking in it that it wasn't working. On…",2

We stayed from Thursday to Sunday and our room was cleaned only once, even though we asked them repeatedly if they could clean it or at least make the bed. We would leave the hotel early to visit the city and when we would get back late at night, we always found ourselves with the surprise that they hadn’t cleaned the room. I think that given the price and “status” of this hotel chain, this would not be a problem. This made our stay here very unpleasant, specially considering that we had to tell them everyday at least twice and they only seemed to listen to us once. A real shame, I won’t be coming here again and I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to anyone.",1

It’s right in the middle of an up and coming area, in a world class city, with value stores and bars right next to it, and personalized amenities😬 they even have showers in every room! The facilities in the lobby are small since the area itself is small, but it’s made up for by the cozy feel. I also felt it was a great value for the money!",5

The room is nothing special,quite small with just beds, the windows can't be closed fully enabling mosquitos to enter, beds are fine. Breakfast is also quite average. Nobody, even at the reception can speak English. They're friendly though, don't get me wrong, but this is not efficient in a hotel. Bad experience with the cleaning staff which threw some of my clothes on the ground after cleaning the room because they were on the bed before. This is not the way any client should find his room. Location is good in the centre, but next to a busy road, so noise can be a bothering factor.",2

6405,"The location is very good.  The tube station is walking distance, as well as the shops.  The breakfast served at the hotel is fantastic.  The only problem is the internet connection, where they give you a low bandwidth, and offer you to buy a high bandwidth.  This is 2017, the internet should be free. :-)",4
6406,"My stay at the Palace Hotel recently was the worst possible. I was fine with the protestors outside the hotel entrance heckling you every time you step in our step out, I was also fine with the non-existent room service and housekeeping on request, the completely inedible quality of breakfast/ lunches being serviced, or even the stunted hotel services - understanding that the hotel was trying to keep the show running as best as they could.  Where I drew the line was when they lost some items sent in for laundry a day before I was supposed to check out, couldn't trace them even the day I had to leave, which led me to missing some of my booked connections and then had to leave after someone regretfully (?) telling me that they will try to locate the same and send it to me at a…",1
6407,"Super nice hotel and overall experience was awesome. We got an upgraded room with a view across the street. Super comfy bed, amazing bathroom and access to the pool was perfect after a day of walking round.",4
6408,"We drank in the bar here which was very plush, minimalist with an inviting courtyard at the back.   My interest was due to this being the hotel that James Earl Ray stayed in for 10 days in 1968 following him assassinating Martin Luther king. ",3
6409,"I wanted to give this hotel a 5/5 based on its location and cool ambiance. However the service really was just not up to snuff. I wanted to give it a 4/5 if possible also. But after thinking about it, the price/performance ratio is too poor given the service level.  Location, ambiance - very nice. Housekeeping and service in general were poor. Housekeeping frequently overlooks items on the checklist. Once they did not clean or replace dirty coffee cups in the morning. I asked for turndown service and asked that they please provide clean coffee cups at that time. They said certainly, apologized, etc., but it still didnt happen. If you ask the front desk for 3-4 items at turndown service (empty garbage, clean cups, etc.) expect about 1/2 of them to be done and the other half…",3
6410,"It took 2 hours to get our room after being told it would be ready in 30 min. They have a holding room bar for people waiting for their rooms. They have coffee (machine didn’t work) croissants fruit.  We had a deluxe room. The holding room was empty when we arrived but soon filled up. After everyone got their room we were still there. After many trips to reception we finally got our room. Not a good beginning. But, after that we really liked the hotel. Our room was very modern as is the entire hotel. Room service was excellent. While awaiting our room I went to the concierge but he was overwhelmed and could take care of everyone’s request. They should have has 2 concierges. I was very disappointed that the Michelin starred restaurant was closed. ",4
6411,"This hotel offers facilities and amenities  a guest can expect. Signages to indicate East or West Wings are not prominent. First time visitors will take some time to orientate. Seeking assistance from hotel staff at the lobby is the easiest approach.   Room at high floor offers quiet atmosphere. Unfortunately, the noisy air-conditioned system can really affect quality of your sleep. Switching it off gives you ventilation problem. This point takes the gloss and value off a modern hotel with Hilton brand. Otherwise, the room is clean, neat and bed is comfortable. Excellent housekeeping quality.  Buffet breakfast quality is reasonable. The speed at the egg and noodles station can be improved. Staff service is good.",2
6412,"I had a wonderful stay - the staff is super friendly, warm and proactively helpful.  The rooms are small, so be prepared for that, but the bedding, furnishings and bathroom are beautifully finished and super comfortable and clean.  Location is great, especially for taking the RER from CDG and around.  Near lots of Metro lines as well.   I will definitely stay here again and recommend it to others!    ",5

Hotel was dark and scary to me and in very sketchy neighborhood! Smoking out in front of front door to hotel at many times and nothing done about it I don't smoke and don't want to smell like it!! Shower was gross, just old shower curtain and floor in shower gross No coffee in room so had to pay $3.50 daily for just a cup!! Loud area at night with numerous bars around, they are aware as ear plugs and sound machines in room. No ice available Most staff not helpful and extremely poor service not to even contact person staying in your hotel to discuss an issue RUDE!!!!!  Look elsewhere",1

Also had a  private deck (stayed in 62). Staff was exceptional, very accomodating. The location was perfect for us, although it was in a more residential area it had everything we needed (stores & resturants). Short walk to La Sagrada Familia.",4
6415,"So, I had read some very interesting reviews about this hostel and planned my stay here for 3 nights on my trip and I would say, it was not that great. For a solo traveller it is very difficult to find company where the majority of people staying at the hostel would like to simply stay at hostel and end up doing nothing other than smoking. I can understand the fact of being in Amsterdam and living your life your way, but the fact is if you are not moving out of your hostel then there is no point of travelling. Also the hostel is pretty far from the red light district and dam square.

6416,"We arrived and checked in. Walked in to the room and first impression was it was dull, scuffed, desperately in need of a makeover. Stained and torn carpet. Grubby shower. Then we noticed the torn sheets on the bed. Husband went down to complain and while he was away I noticed coffee cup rings or something on the worksurface and grubby marks all over the mirror. The maid appeared almost at once with fresh sheets, and I pointed out the marks and the mirror. She sighed very loudly and threatrically. We left her to it and went out. When we came back, the sheets were changed, the marks were gone and the mirror was less grubby than before... but while we were there I thought it best never to go barefoot on that floor.

And the desk clerk rudely shrugged and said we'd get the 40% back in 2-3 days. We didn't and we were on a budget too. It was a prepaid travel credit card and I checked my balance to be HORRIFIED to see that they took almost $400.00 dollars extra and the desk clerk lied to me when she said it was ok to pay cash as they won't take 2 payment! My trip was ruined as I had to chase everyday at my expense and was getting nowhere. Finally my prepaid card company sorted it and requested a headed letter from days inn.

6419,"I hate to use Trip Advisor as a tool to bash hotels. It is a blunt instrument and sadly gives a bad impression where one is potentially not necessary.  Perhaps its the language barrier. I don't speak cantonese and there seems to be very little english spoken across the whole hotel. I checked in yesterday for a business meeting. I made two reservations at the hotel as I will be attending a conference being held here. The reservations were made via the Accor rewards website as my plans had changed.  Because I made two reservations, I had two room types. I let them know and they said to me that actually, I could move into my other room early (I did ask about the price differential - I.e.

We were also able to get into our room the morning after we landed which was great too. The room was very spacious, clean and well appointed. We especially loved having 2 mirrors outside the bathroom to help with getting ready. The bathroom are large with nice toiletries though not very many hooks or racks to hang towels. We never heard any noise from others rooms. They offer a large, daily buffet breakfast. It's a feast.

Our room was very comfortable on the 4th floor on the main street side.  This did not cause a noise issue.  I did, however, feel that our room was a long way from the lifts and it could be quite confusing finding your way to the room from the lift.  The breakfast buffet did not provide much in the way of gluten-free food.  The bread & crackers were disgusting & inedible.  Eggs took an age to be cooked.  Apart from fruit, cheese, yoghurt, bacon & eggs, there was nothing interesting to eat.  Also, an international hotel should also be able to provide a decent cup of tea with real milk.  What is this issue with Europeans not using real milk? …",4

Had called them regarding the airport pickup charges, to which they asked me to another number (so-called travel desk) which is a local tour & travel shop outside the hotel. Not a great hospitality I would say. 2. The reception folks were pretty lethargic and didn't feel much welcomed. Even the bell boys (if you managed to find them) were not eager to help with the luggage from the taxi until asked. 3. The room allotted was having seam smell, spider webs at furniture corners. Upon complaining they offered a room freshner! Totally unexpected, specially given they are 197 rooms and we went in off season (hotel…",2

Your typical treadmills, elipticals, but a nice selection of both free weights, bosu balls, yoga mats and Life machines for resistance training.  There was a nice separate room off of the main workout room that could be used for yoga, stretching, etc. which contained two bosu balls (large and small) for abdominal and stretching work.

Not big options for breakfast.Only some basic items,not value for money. During the last night,When I got up,I have on muddy water to wash myself.I should go and buy a bottle of water to brush my teeth. Again another duty manager was not giving any assistance!!!!! I sincerely regrets for this esteem hotel with a good location having incompetent staff. ",2

It’s a really cool and quirky hotel and tastefully decorated. The staff on reception are so helpful and easy going and the bar is lovely as are the bar the staff. The room is really cool, small but modern with mirrors, wooden floors and large windows so it is far from cramped.

We booked a room online at canaves II (the newer units) but upon arrival were placed in canaves I, and when we inquired about the discrepency we were given a lame excuse about travel agents not knowing the difference (even though we didn't use a travel agent and our confirmation explicitly read CANAVES II).

The windows are thick and block out all noise from the exterior.  Air conditioning is strong, keeping the room cool at the peak of summer, and the beds have duvets with big fluffy pillows.   Very comfortable indeed.  We were kindly upgraded to a junior suite which has the benefit of more room, a powder room and a huge soaking tub.  Toiletries are from Aqua Di Parma.

Therefore, my expectations were quite low and that probably turned out to be a good thing. First, the receptionist was not friendly or welcoming upon check in. Second, our room overlooks the projects and within 30 seconds of being in the room, we saw a man urinate in public about 25 yards from the hotel. Third, there was a used washcloth hanging over the shower curtain rod in our bathroom. If the housekeepers missed this obvious object, what else did they overlook when ""cleaning"" the room before our check in?

But that isn't even the worst of it.   My friends and I (7 total) were stuck in one for 45 minutes. The hotel NEVER called the fire department which is normally required by law. Instead they tried to get us out with crowbars. But they couldn't get the doors open.

We faced disorganized staff that did not communicate with each other. Furthermore the hotel is extremely dated! Has not been updated in decades, dirty, loud and truly more of a 2 star experience. It is clear that Eden Roc has not invested in the resources it takes to have experienced reception staff. Try Fontainebleau next door - much nicer in aesthetics and service.",1

Despite having specified a 'non-smoking' room, I was given a 'smoking' room which reeked of cigarettes. Since the hotel was full, I had to wait half a day before they were able to give me a room that didn't stink like cigarettes. Upon arrival to room #2, it felt like a sauna. The heat was on full blast and it wouldn't shut off. An hour later a technician showed up to resolve the problem. Both rooms were in desperate need of a refresh. The decor, condition of mattress, bed sheets, etc.. made it feel like a 1970s Holiday Inn as opposed to a landmark Sheraton hotel in Argentina's capital city.

I booked a TAXI from Hotel Concierge for AIRPORT Drop and the TAXI charged me 206 Yuan. My local friend told me that it shouldn't cost anything more than 100 YUAN.

The hotel is a four minute walk to the U-Bahn stop at Wittenbergerplatz. The hotel is clean, the staff is friendly. The breakfast is good and probably the same as one would find at any business hotel in Europe. The only complaint would be the wifi system which appears to be in need of an upgrade.

It would have been so cool if I had the kind of room they market, I love baboons. It was great they let me stay 2 hours later after the check out. I guess I  have to try to repeat this. ",4
6463,"We had a pleasant 3 day stay in a nice hotel on the water, but also with a Hilton, Hyatt and many other great options available immediately nearby. I had booked online months in advance, but the rate went from $340/night to $650/night for the third night. A ridiculous rate increase, of course, but the website provides no easily identifiable option to change room for a single night. Perhaps a “Click here to avoid being ripped off by Marriott” button would be a good option. On check-in, surprise surprise, a full hotel provides no alternative. The Supervisor on duty when we checked out was very helpful, certainly more so than the manager - who wasn’t prepared to exit their office or to discuss the issue. A courtesy $100 discount was helpful, but not enough to prevent me opting for…",2

6465,"We chose this hotel as it was near to where our friends live. We were allocated a room right at the top! This was OK as there was a lift but for the last 10 stairs which is not so easy when you are elderly! We had to pull our suitcases up the last few stairs!  It seems that hotels here do not provide a kettle, coffee & tea in your room like they do in the UK!However tea & coffee facilities were available in the reception area. A continental breakfast was €10 extra. There wasno restaurant inthe hotel, but there are plenty of speciality  restaurants in the locality to choose from. The staff were all welcoming & helpful & were very obliging when I wanted an English cup of tea made with boiling water as opposed to hot water!",3
6466,"All I can say is, when I went to check in there were two pilots checking out in full uniform. I am glad I am not on their plane if they slept anything like me.  My new wife and I spent two and half weeks travelling the West Coast of the US and we finished our trip in San Francisco, booking in at  Holiday Inn Fisherman’s Wharf thinking we could rely on the strong brand and consistent quality they deliver. We were under no illusion that the hotel would be anything other than basic, but confident it would be clean and somewhere we could have a good night’s sleep. We were wrong, I wouldn’t even put a prisoner in this hotel. It was inexcusably horrendous and it is clear there is no incentive to encourage repeat custom.  When we arrived, all signs were good. Clean and modern hotel…",1
6467,"We stayed here 3 years ago and it was pristine, however it is showing signs of age now. Paths around the pool are beginning to disintegrate and crumble, carpets in corridors are stained and marked, towels are rather thin and threadbare, no face flannels in bathrooms, air conditioning is poor and bars and meals are rather over priced. Needs some updating. Staff are helpful when you need something though. ",3
6468,"We booked the hotel  as it was close to centre .But the rooms are very small ( although booked a king room with extra price) , too noisy , furniture specially carpet very dirty .bathroom too small and no place to put even a small personal toiletry bag .   the stuff at the front desk too arrogant and rude. l do not recommend to anyone at all .

Here are the plusses and negatives:  + location is good, right in the center + pool is quite nice ( with the view) +ok friendly staff, ok english (basic vietnam) + decent aircondition  - terribly hard beds. I have been to many many hotels and here the beds are a decades old hard rock mattreses. Worst bed ever.  - no warm water in shower. From those 6 nights we spent there, we got warm water 2 times. We tried both in the mornings and in the evenings and it was a total guess when that luxury was available.  - very few sunbeds at the beach and pool. We hade to lie on the sand almost every day. I would estimate that there is a sunbed / chair for about 20 - 30% of the guests.  - rooms are really simple, nothing to expect there. Rooms were clean…",2

Great value for money as title suggests, ill be back.",5
6471,"We stayed at this hotel over the bank holiday weekend. Good location in order to see all the main sites. Public transport is on the doorstep, which helps if you are looking to pop a bit further out or you feet are just tired from all the walking. Short walk from where the TXL bus drops you off too.  Rooms were standard and a big size, equipped will all the usual mod cons. Bathroom was also bug, with shower and bath. Good selection of breakfast choice from hot to cold and is all self service.  In general modern, clean hotel that meets your needs for a short trip to the city",4

6473,"I made a reservation without paying for the whole 3 nights, I tried to check out the next day since the first night experience was horrible, but I was lied to that my reservation type meant that they would charge for 3 night anyways; when I finally checked out the manager told me that actually that was a mistake and in fact I could've checked out after the first night. So the idea of being trapped in the hotel that is filthy and have no ability to go to another one was overall a horrible experience!",1
6474,"I booked online through snap travel. When I checked in, I was told the hotel was full. I had entered my room to fine my bed about 16” off the floor. The room was very dark since they use efficient lightbulbs. I asked do a room with a window to allow some light. There were no rooms available. The lamp had a shade that kept falling and again minimal light to the point I was unable to read a map. The thermostats were set or off and my room was stifling. The engineer brought me a new light with a bright bulb. And unbeknownst to me there was a window with a wall covering over it. We got the window open about 3 inches. Thank heavens it was only one night!",1

6476,"We have just returned from this hotel (26/10-30/10), and would not recommend to anyone!! During a 4 night stay, our bed linen wasn’t changed at all, our room not hoovered at all & the room not serviced on 2 days. Not the standard you would expect from a supposed 5 star hotel. We had to change rooms on arrival, as our ‘executive rooms’ at the rear of the hotel were tired, shabby & looked over a car park. The new rooms were marginally better with a lake view, however, this came at a cost of $40 a night  per room for four nights! The removal of the executive lounge is to the hotels detriment, and $10 a day per person & $120 credit on the room was little compensation & difficult to spend given the lack of choices. $27 for a sub standard breakfast that didn’t include many American…",1
6477,"I’m not one to moan normally  but ... Words can not describe how bad this hotel is. The lift breaks down continuously and even when working leaves you a times half a metre above or below the floor you want. Rooms are utterly worn out and while look clean when you enter ours had hairs in the bed and pillows. Floors are warped in room. Electrics where dangerous sparking as you put in took out plugs. Would not wish this hotel on my worst enemy. The plus side is location, kitchen was usable  and staff where friendly. Think Long and hard before booking this one you have been warned",1
6478,"We have a reservation for 2 rooms for next week which I made couple months ago for thanksgiving week, and I called the hotel to verify about renovation and union strike.  I mentioned that I assume that 3 year renovation (that what the reception told  me it will take)  is not something unplanned and I read nothing about it when making the reservation and while I agreed with her that they might not have control over the strike it is in their hands to decide if they compensate guests or introduce special rates.  The lady over the phone told me that based on my questions or concerns the hotel might not fit us and then she just hang up.  It might be that I am the million customer calling her with same concerns but it did feel that they just don't care.  I was expecting more from…",1

6480,"Let me start by saying, I have been a Hilton Honors Member since 2013 and have never had an issue of any kind until my family and I arrived at this particular hotel. The front desk staff could not find my reservation.  I had coincidentally printed all my reservations since we would be in California for 25 days and would be staying at different Hilton properties.   I don't want to bore you with all the detail, but it took 3.5 hours to get this clarified. Keep in mind the mistake was on there end and they still could not treat us with the respect we deserved.  They went as fare as to tell me they had given us a complimentary upgrade for the trouble. I only stay at Hilton Properties and that was far from an upgrade.  But wait it does not stop there, even the bellman was rude and…",1
6481,"My husband and I went to Nha Trang for 22 nights and I choose a new Hotel. But we regreated.Breakfast is too weak for a westerner. It has little choice and is repetitive. The Hotel turns off the air conditioner at 3 am and turns it on again in the morning. It wakes up at dawn full of heat and in the cold morning. Also, the air conditioner is poorly positioned relative to the bed which makes it all prone to catching a cold or worse. The cleanliness is very poor. From day one there was dirt in almost every room. The double room was after all made up of two single beds together, with a small mattress to disguise the junction. We had days with bits of soap because they didn't renew them. Result we changed hotel.",2
6482,I have been coming to this hotel for years and in the main have enjoyed my visits which have included excellent customer service and good food! On this occasion the service at breakfast fell far short of expectations! The self service at breakfast is now partial self service with no customer satisfaction! Having selected my choices from self service I had to locate someone to order toast from which took nearly ten minutes! I asked for brown toast only to be given a piece of non toasted bread! I sent it back and it came partially toasted! I sent it back again and only then did it come toasted! An ordeal lasting nearly twenty five minutes! I had to order scrambled egg which took a while to do too! My meal by this time was stone cold!! On my last day I ordered toast and waited…,2
6483,"Stayed 6 nights in June in a newly renovated suite?? The suite was very tiny. The mattress and pillows were terrible, so old and soft we did not sleep, very poor quality considering the cost of this suite. The plunge pool was a joke, so tiny. The restaurant / pool manager was disgraceful, showed no personality, interaction or interest with guests and absolutely no support or training toward the very young restaurant / pool staff. Only ever heard him barking orders at them. Very uncomfortable. 2 positives only if you do choose to stay here,, the massage girls are fantastic, friendly, bubbly and great at their job! Secondly the location was good. I hate to be so negative but I hope it saves others from a massive let down on arrival which we felt, not what I expected at all and…",3

When we got there the air conditioning in the lobby didn't work. The three elevators only one was working. At one point a guest got stuck in the one elevator that broke down. Big tour groups stay there so with one elevator working it took a half hour to go up and down. We used the stairs which smelled like urine. The room we stayed in was sparse, the bed furniture was torn. At least the air conditioning worked in the room.  There was no safe in the room and we had to have them bring in a room safe. The breakfast was not very good, and I had to give a plate back that was not clean. The wait staff grabs your plates…",2

This was our first time at this hotel and it seemed that the gentleman at check-in was not pleased (almost taking it personal) that we used a third-party to reserve our room. He did not believe that Hotwire booked us a room with a king size bed. We had to prove it to him (it took my husband a moment or two to pull it up on his phone)...when we did, we were given a handicap room...it was nice, but not great. Not one other hotel employee greeted us. We felt like they were treating us like we were the ones who should of been grateful to be ""allowed"" to stay there. The hotel itself...beautiful! Location...great! Room....nice. So, if you don't care about customer service....and only care about location...this is…",1

6489,"Picked this place at random off a promotional advertisement, as it appeared to have undergone a recent refurbishment and needed to get the crowds back  For:  The promotional price was good value / Good location, being 2 blocks back from the busy city centre / Larger than average room with space to move about  Against: Trendy open to all bathrooms may be a designer trend, but NO! / Still has a fair way to go in terms of getting the in-house restaurant functioning  Summary: Young staff doing their utmost best to assist wherever they can. Yes there may have been a few glitches along the way and the in-house restaurant needs to learn about food safety with under cooked meats, but overall....Recommended",4

A great find, I think it's the OD brand's first venture in Barcelona and they should be pretty happy so far. The hotel has a modern ""designed"" appearance, which would appeal to the younger trendier traveller, which I'm not but still found it ""appealing"". The rooms are simple, sleek and well thought out. Rainwater shower, twin hand basins, nice bed, reasonable storage, good TV and clever lighting with a very simple All Lights out switch, all in all very nice indeed. Our room had a shutter instead of curtains that completely blanked out the external light, so remember to set your alarm. Breakfast…",4
6491,Was it ever confusing with two elevators that we had to use just to get to our rooms!  Sloping ceiling that I hit my head on four times!  Slow learner!  Window was on the side alley which was fine but it rained a lot and the dripping from the roof was loud.  Thankfully I had ear plugs.  They are a must!!!,3
6492,"Just tucked off the main Kur'damm shopping street the Bristol is a quiet haven. The staff are efficient and mostly friendly. The bar is comfortable and refurbished in a gentleman's club style with a roaring fire in winter, ginger tea and swedish mulled wine. Next door is a zippier disco type bar zone so they are trying to appeal to everyone.  Not all rooms are upgraded and felt a bit tired with grubby sanitary ware/grouting and we couldn't get the room temperature right at night - it was quite hot and woke us. But it was quiet and comfortable and you can immediately jump on a bus and explore the city with ease. The restaurant was very good and there's an excellent upscale Italian across the road and one of the most famous currywurst shops a few hundred meters away.",4
6493,"Summary: Service at the front desk and restaurant was decent, proficient. Breakfast is minimal. Rooms can be improved. The air con is cold and quiet but doesn't help if everything else is loud (see below). Not many other restaurants near by.   Some issues I encountered with the room, there is water damage below the desk. There is no water pressure in the shower. There were little bugs crawling on the vanity kit. The room has paper thin walls and porous windows, you can hear the tv next door, constant door slams (should really invest in a hydraulic system) and people walking / talking in the hallways, also hear cars backing in on the street below (to be fair I was on the 2/F).   On my first day, I had my door opened by house keeping without prior knocking or ringing the door bell…",2
6494,"I guess it was bad luck, but we had a column in the middle of the room, which wasn't nice at all. If we sat on the table we wouldn't be able to see if someone was on the bed or watch tv.  The shower was broke and the hairdryers wouln't work for longer than a minute.  The rooms were clean, but in the lifts and halls to go to the rooms there was a weird smell.  Service was quite nice and breakfast was good.",3
6495,They booked us above a wedding reception. It was so loud the bed and floor were vibrating. We were travelling with a child. Terrible customer service when we called to complain. They could have cared less.,1
6496,"I like MARRIOTT hotels but this is a step above most of them. The room (junior suite) was huge, and spotlessly clean. The staff were excellent and the food was very good. Ate at the Midtown grill. Not cheap but their steak specials were good value, and even got some marshmallows and a little flame grill to toast them on when the bill came. Huge breakfast selection, including omelettes and poached eggs to order. Only weakness of the place was the business lounge. Very stuffy atmosphere ie they needed to turn the air con up, and didn’t have the normal range of nibbles that you normally get. Location was spot on. Less than 10 minutes walk to the Brandenburg gates and a few minutes to Jewish memorial etc. Overall, as above, a great hotel. I’d certainly recommend it to anyone.",4
6497,"This hotel has a nice view of leblon and ipanema and the whole coast. But they took 30 minutes to check me in (not exaggerating) and first gave me a better room but because they couldn't figure out how to magnetize the room keys gave us another room that was in a lower floor. They even told us it was an upgrade but given that our room was really really small I just think they gave us something else and said it was an upgrade to avoid any additional problems. Breakfast was ok but too expensive really for what you get. Location is also not practical to go around, you can walk to Leblon but other than that can everywhere.  ",2

We had not included breakfast but there are many cafes and restaurants in the surrounding area. Small hotel with nice location if you want to stay in the Old Town. Walking distance to Placa de Catalunya 15 min, Picasso Museum 15 min and beach / harbor 20 min. We may stay there again.",4

The whole staff was very friendly and helpful, I would like to thank them all. The rooftop cafe will be more splendid with more attention. Thanks ",4
6501,"Hotel location although right on the beach is very remote from anywhere, Calheta is very very quiet 40 minutes from Funchal and will cost  50 euros each way in a taxi. Rooms are clean but no toiletries or tea and coffee making facilities certainly what you would expect for a 4 star hotel. Food extremely bland tasteless and barely warm not what is advertised in the hotel lifts as gourmet dinning!!!!. I understand the need to have plastic glasses around the pool area but to have them in the inside bar area in the evening is totally unacceptable!!!! This hotel could be very nice if the above area were addressed but as it stands it does not rate as a 4 star.",3
6502,"I have stayed here many, many times and it is always a delight. The breakfast buffet is amazing. The rooms are clean, functional and comfortable. The spa is wonderful. The staff are courteous, professional, polite and welcoming. There is a new general manager who has changed things around a bit. There is a very strict and limited key fob access to the well-being and sauna parts of the spa which is an extra charge of €15. What I would also say is that whilst this hotel is amazing, it would be relevant to mention that it is one of those hotels where there us an air of intimidation. It is way too formal which as a guest, jade me quite uncomfortable. A hotel is supposed to be lie a home away from home, yet thus is not how I felt here.",4
6503,The workers were always there to help when we needed it. The hotel was spotless and clean everyday. Couldn’t fault it at all. I would deffo plan on going again I absolutely loved it. Decor of the room is beautiful,5
6504,"Spotlessly clean basic hotel. You won't find some amenities that you might be used to here like tea making and trouser press facilities but for a hotel aimed at the short stay market they aren't really necessary. Whats important here is cleanliness, crisp white sheets, up to date decor and it's great location. Just off Alexander platz and close to the excellent transport system. What more could you want.",4
6505,We enjoyed our stay at Hotel L'Olivier.   We were made very welcome at the hotel which we found was a great base for our long weekend.  It is very close (walking distance) to both the beach and the old town where there are a number of very good restaurants.   Our room looked over the courtyard and we had doors out where we could sit and enjoy both the morning and evening sunshine.  Our room and the communal areas are spotlessly clean and inviting.  Car park spaces are non reservable and there are only a few 'marked' spots but the staff were very accommodating and we managed to squeeze an extra car or two into the space.  Overall a great find and we would certainly not hesitate to stay again on our next visit to Cannes.,5
6506,"In bedroom= the toilet flush took more than half one hour to recharge, shortage of hot water in two  out of five days at night, the shower box was leaking and wetting the floor, the towels were too rough, we couldn't keep the top pillow centered in the bed. In common areas, the elevator broke in two out of five days, at check out  they took too much time to complete the payment using our vouchers, there were too much  leaves and dirty in front of the main entrance. We were surprise discovering there is no frigobar in the bedroom.",2
6507,Most horrific room service xperience. A Cesar Salad from hell charged 50 dollars that would have my dog yelp of disgust.  Pool stands for a large bathtub and elevators are squeaking. Its not a bad place per se but just a place to sleep for a night since its not that far from the airport,2
6508,"Me and my two friends stayed here and all I can say is that the only way I would return to this hostel is if they got all new staff!  Not only are they so rude, they are also very unhelpful and unorganised.   My friend payed for an extra night and upon checking out she was asked to pay again as they had not noted it down. She was made to feel bad with the receptionist saying ""it will come out my pocket now"". They also refused to give the passports back. We had to plead with her!   The bar staff are also very unfriendly.  They  physically pushed my friend out the way after they changed  their mind that she could change the music! They were also reluctant to be flexible for travelers needs! For example I tried to get a happy hour at 9.58 and told rudely ""no 2 minutes"". The food is…",2

This is not a property they usually work with, but they thought it met our requested needs.  The location is amazing in the heart of the 6th.  It is right by the Luxembourg Gardens, and an easy walk to St. Germaine and the Seine.    The front desk staff was always extremely helpful, and had great recommendations for local restaurants.  They were very responsive to requests.  Very polite, never brusque.  The first room we stayed in was quite small by American standards, but normal for Paris.

Hilton did nothing to help out and it was so disturbing to have had someone in your room when you were gone. I do not know how it happened but it did. Out of 37 years of traveling and staying around the world this is the first time I have ever had anything taken from my hotel room. will never be staying at this hotel again,",1
6512,"  If you are looking for a hotel that is close to the beach, this is a great choice.  Literally 3 minute walk to the beautiful My Khe Beach!  But, that’s pretty much it.  You won’t find anything else at this hotel.  Let’s talk about the staff.  Only one of the girls working there was absolutely pleasant and actually seemed trained at what she was doing.  The hotel porter was also very kind too. But the others staff members, I cannot say the same.  There was one male staff that was absolutely horrible. I’m pretty sure the concept of smiling or saying hello or saying thank you was not known to him – anything about being pleasant was just not known to him.  Just one example from many – the hotel kept changing their passwords for some reason for the wifi.  So we called the front…",2
6513,"My 17 year old daughter and I stayed here for two nights. Obviously, it is a boat converted into a hotel, as the name suggest. So do not expect the luxury of a 4-star hotel. We were happy with our stay. Having stayed on a luxury cruise boat before, the rooms might have been a bit small and the shower/toilet smelly/stuffy. But even this is to be understood as it is not a luxury cruiseliner. Rooms were neat and tidy.The breakfast was ok, staff friendly and helpful and location good. It is good to go for breakfast slightly earlier in the morning. Then it is not that busy and cramped. As mentioned in other reviews, a 15 minutes ferry ride takes you the Amsterdam Centraal Station. You don't pay for the ferry. A lift and wifi is available.",3
6514,"I stayed here with a couple of friends and enjoyed my time here. There were a few complaints such as the fact that the location is not the most prominent, it is a hotel trying to be a hostel, and the beds are not clean. If you get past the drawbacks then the H2 is a great cheap place to stay in Berlin",4

Before this year I really enjoyed hostel, but the last day of our stay, while we were having breakfast, money was stolen from our wallets - so I changed my opinion.  Reception said that there are no possibilities to get report who were in our room, neither to check cameras (which were outside our room), cause cameras are not filming...  Also our review/comments after staying in this hostel were not published in another web page for some reasons..",3

6520,Welcome coffee was much appreciated due to check in process being extremely lengthy (5 hours). We did request early check in months in advance but were not given the option upon arrival.  Staff was nice but the hotel was busy. It would not have mattered but we travelled with kids on a overnight flight. Staff was overall friendly and worked hard. A let down was that this property doesn’t really provide any perks for being a Marriott platinum member upon check in or have a kids club / area. Overall room was spacious (1 bedroom ocean view on a high floor).  Bed was comfortable.  Bathroom needs improvement (mold in and around shower).  Restaurants at hotel are pricey but there are a lot of options to eat around the hotel within a short walk. Pool is not heated but nice on a hot day.…,4

6522,"Pros:  * Breakfast choices were amazing; quite a lot to choose from. Not just the usual assortment of bread. They served pancakes (make your own, using a pancake maker) and omelette to order. They had a variety of coffee and tea, fruits, jam and cheese. * Centrally located. Just a few metres from Checkpoint Charlie and is close to a U-bahn station. If you like shopping, it's also close to the Berlin Mall. * The room was clean. Bathroom was clean. * Luggage storage was well-organised even if they had a lot of customers. * They have complimentary water and cookies at the lobby. The lobby was large enough and had many seats.  Cons: There is only one, and yet it is very important: the receptionist who attended to us. We arrived early and inquired whether we could check in. She said…",4

6524,"We were very pleased with the room, and the hotel in general.   The only disappointment was on the day we left, when we picked up our luggage from the supervised luggage room, next to the reception.  We had to spend 3 hours in the city after check-out, due to a late flight. So, we left our luggage at the hotel during check-out. An identification ticket was attached to the luggage and a nother one given to us. When we came to pick up the luggage, we were told it was easier to just show witch ones were ours, than to hand over the ticket. There were like 40 bags, and I could have taken anyone’s luggage at the time. Definitely a policy that should be improved.  Other than that, the staff was great.",4
6525,"What I really like about Berlin is the mix of old and modern. There are a lot of old historical buildings with great architecture on one hand, and great modern restaurants and cool coffee shops on the other hand. Looking for a decent hotel, I had quiet some options. What I like about this hotel is it's great location. It is located near metrostation Rosenthaler platz and surrounded by high quality restaurants and breakfast places.  The rooms are minimalistic and neat. The rooms are small, but never give this feeling due to smart placement and decoration. My room on the seventh floor even had a balcony. Great value for money.",4
6526,This hostel is really cool. You walk through a beer garden to get to it and is reasonably close to city center. The rooms are nice and always clean as well as the showers. One of the few hostels that we went to where the showers are always clean and free which is really good. It's good for social stuff with its own bar and the breakfast was good. Staff really friendly as well... so yeah it was cool. If you are in Berlin defo hit it this place!,5

6529,Went there for dinner with one of my friend at Aurum. We were not at all satisfied with the quality of food and service. Wanted to order some fruits but initially the person taking the order was least interested and told that even mangoes will not be available but upon insisting he brought the fruit platter that too with raw papaya. Ambience of the place is good but they need to improve in the quality of food and service standards. The most awkward thing was asking for mobile number even before taking the order.,2
6530,"I wrote an earlier review recounting my experience of getting to the Silversmith and being told the hotel was oversold despite the fact that a colleague and I prepaid our reservation.  Somehow the review was deleted by TripAdvisor even though it met the guidelines.  Hmmm.  At any rate, we were ""walked over"" at 1 am to another, cheaper hotel.  We weren't ""walked over"" so much as shown the door with a letter that said the Silversmith would pay for our hotel at this other hotel.  No apologies, not even directions, though the hotel did spring for cab fare after we complained about having to walk the streets in search of another hotel at 1 am.  It seems that this isn't rare at the Silversmith.  Beware before you prepay.  The hotel was gracious enough to refund our prepayment after I…",1

We had issues on check in about paying extra tax and had to tell the reception staff we had already paid. We decided to have the Christmas buffet which was a mistake. It was very expensive  at $120 US per person. It was supposed to have a show which turned out to be just one person on a guitar and a woman singing that was it.The service was terrible and certainly not worth the money.  Breakfast was dreadful on both mornings. The scrambled eggs were not cooked and were still runny and again the service was poor. We had to wait at least 20 minutes for butter and bacon even though the staff were…,2

Cappuccino in the am in 5 minutes to the room  View 9/10  Restaurant 8/10 limited menu and just average food compared to other restaurants.  Spa 9/10 great therapists who really care  Gym 8/10 you must make apt to use which was not a problem even with a full hotel.

They didn't have a handicap restroom in the lobby they didn't even have a restroom in the lobby at all the elevator was so tiny that I could not get in it unless I was alone. Going into the main door there was a difference in height and I could not get in with my wheelchair by myself and the elevator entrance had a drop down to get in and out without help.

After the first night we realize that our room does not have air conditioning. We couldn't sleep. We complained about the problem and they said that there is a massive work in the hotel trying to replace all the wires (or something like that). We had to spend another night without having air conditioning. After three nights we ask them politely to change the room because it was impossible to sleep in a room at 27 degrees celsius. So, yes, they chanced the room. This time we had AIR. However, the rooms were clean and tidy. We can't complain about that.  The breakfast is veeeery poorly. If you like bread with…",3

The room I got had all feather pillows, with a mouldy smell, and a constant loud dripping sound from behind one wall.  Must be where the mould comes from.  Also, the bathroom had a shower curtain, but no barrier for the water.  The whole bathroom flooded when I showered. Woke up this morning with a tight chest, blocked sinuses and in a foul mood.

I can carry a bag with knives at Railway stations & Airports & not allowed to carry the same in a hotel. This I guess is harassing the customer. And if they want to implement the same, they should write & warn when we make a reservation, like in flights that you'll are not supposed to carry these items.",2

They also had no cots, but offered us bedding so she could ""sleep on the floor"".  Really? For $200 a night?  I had to have Priceline intercede as I had booked through Priceline.

The check-in was fast and efficient with Alex kindly explaining things to do in the area along with key sites in Barcelona overall.  The rooms were spacious with high quality dishware and appliances. The terrace also offered some nice outdoor space. The bedrooms and en suite bathroom were perfectly sized for one person - it might be a wee bit tight if two people share one bedroom.  The location is on the quiet side and is optimum if you need an oasis of quiet to return to after a day in noisy Barcelona.

6546,"Stayed here for three night and was made welcome, facilities were great, hotel was spotless as expected.  On entering the lobby you see a really cool and stylish space. There is a large seating area in the lobby with a bar. Our room was also very stylish with lovely artwork, an insanely-comfortable bed and well-equipped bathroom.   Full tea and coffee-making facilities in the room was a bonus.  Location is ideal, in the ‘fancy’ end of town, right by the ruined church, with an underground station just meters away, the train station 5 minutes walk.  Overall I would definitely recommend this stylish, friendly, high-end hotel.",5

The hotel staffs tried to blame it on me requesting why I didn't approach them before.

My husband and I stayed at the Hilton during a recent conference to Chicago. As the conference was being held in the Hilton, the company had arranged for us to stay at the Hilton. Our first room was dirty and extremely dusty. I went to the front desk to request another room and the check-in concierge was so understanding and not at all surprised that the first room was too dirty to stay in.

The pool is fantastic - the biggest hotel pool I've had on holiday. Even when children were playing with balls and inflatables, there was plenty of room to swim. Those with children need to be vigilant as there is no lifeguard.  There were rules about not reserving sun beds which were completely ignored it was only on our last day we saw a manager dragging towels off beds.

Bus, U and S Bahn connections are first rate, so getting about the city from this base is a breeze. Even the relatively cosy Comfort class rooms are spacious enough for a relaxed stay - after all, you'll be out exploring Berlin most of the time.

Highly recommended - I'll be back.",5

There also was some pipe burst or something as there was this terrible smell one morning on the ground floor. The breakfast is very good though, plenty of choice. The only down side is the staff who were not friendly but very forgetful - every day we had to ask for it coffee twice before it arrived. The gym is very good too, well equipped.

There is no point opening the balcony door as the street noise is very loud. To begin with we were told we'd been upgraded to an Executive Floor room only to find that the room was next to the elevator and it felt like you were taking off in a plane every 2 seconds as the lifts went up and down non-stop. We asked to move rooms and were downgraded to a lower floor. The hotel is set back a couple of blocks from the beach so views are past other high rise buildings.

Every other Marriott that I have stayed at that does not provide a lounge compensates you with free breakfast. Not this Marriott. You get a thousand points, which is peanuts compared to breakfast.

The apartment was spacious and the air con worked well. The shower was great with lovely hot water and good water pressure.   However, I wouldn’t recommend this hotel even for the price. After four nights sleeping on very hard (and very creaky!) beds, both of us were waking up with bad backs.

The hotel has a central laundry, which English speakers found difficult to use. There was one ironing board in the laundry for all guests, and none in the apartments.

Finally, I went and saw the facilities and decided it was better to let $800 go down the drain than be miserable for four days. I booked myself into the Hyatt instead and while I was…",1
6582,It was over 100 degrees in France when our cruise stopped in Cannes and the best decision I made was to reserve loungers/umbrellas on the pier of the Carlton private beach club in advance.  It was the highlight of our vacation week to relax by the cool water and feel the breeze while sipping pina coladas served by the excellent staff.  It wasn't inexpensive but was totally worth the price for luxury.  I also felt my family and belongings were totally safe.  ,5
6583,"Great location and overall very comfortable rooms. However with just a a little more attention to detail  could make this a great hotel. First off after a long day of travel we got to our room to find no tea/coffee sachets- plenty of fruit tea and decaf coffee though and only 2 small thimbles of milk. Not too big a deal and rather then have to tip some one to bring us up some, we went over to the supermarket to get our own. Having bought some cheese and milk as well we were most annoyed the next day to find the fridge didn’t close properly as it was attached to the cupboard and the food was spoiled. Despite turning up the fridge and removing it from the hinge so it could close properly, drinks stayed barely cold. Not quite sure why they offer a kitchenette - there are no…",4

We did not realize that there were no TVs in the room either.  We did not have warm/hot water when showering in the morning.  There were not enough sun chairs around the pool to accommodate guests. A bunch of children with their inflatable toys made enjoying a relatively small pool difficult. The beach was not sand or pebbles when entering the water.  Instead, it was smooth volcanic rocks slabs that made you feel like you were walking on a slick ice rink when entering the water.   ",3

The staff, though, insisted that we should change our reservation. All throughout our stay the staff was unfriendly to us, especially at the café/bar area.  In addition to that, our rooms (when we finally got them) were very unclean. One of our rooms had a bar smell that would not leave, even when we opened windows and added air fresheners.

Flat screen tv and hairdryer large mirror and there was even a small kitchenette within a cupboard. View over the pool was nice with table and chairs on small balcony. Room was cleaned daily and maid was friendly.  What we didn't realise was the hotel is part of 3 and meals are not all served in the Mimosa which means you had to walk up the hill after eating your evening meal and the entertainment room was packed with 3 hotels worth of clients and the bar in that area is a pay one.

We were in room 307 which did not have a window in the bathroom, I`ve seen other which had. Breakfast we found to be the biggest manko. Atmosphere is like a canteen, lights are not creating a comfortable atmosphere, there are trays to place your food on and the trolley standing there to put your used tray on, gives the impression that you are at the universities canteen rather than in a hotel.

One of the best restaurants are to be found in the old town, for example Le Chapevon Rouge and da bouttau Auberge Provencale.

The room was marginally clean, mattress was saggy, and bathroom smelled of mildew. This was one of the worst hotel experiences I've ever known, and I travel a lot.

The windows were fused shut so couldn't get any fresh air in my room.  The bed was ancient and the bedding was old and ratty.

The room itself fas quite big, had a big tv, desk, chair, king size bed, wardrobe with safe and bathroom with shower and bath. You could easily fit a lounge suit in there as well if they wanted to.   The bed was comfortable by Chinese standards but still a bit harder then it would have been in a western country. Bathroom was really nice and had plenty of amenities.

They would not take my card, either ATM or Credit.  From the moment we walked in we were treated with suspicion, were not looked at in the eye; the agent was dismissive bordering on hostile.  I several times tried to have a calm conversation with her, to explain the circumstances, and each time after two words she interrupted and yelled; she refused to participate in a civil conversation.  Aven after hotwire cancelled and I attempted in a civil way to give feedback on the experience, she absolutely refused to engage with me person to person.  Even more interesting, while Nikki P was on the phone with hotwire (apparently to the hotwire agent she was not polite with them either), she put that agent on hold to check in two young ladies from France.

Moved to 7th floor then, like in bad movies we were straight looking to a grey wall then, which was only one meter from the window. Actually, it was a bit less noisy, then.

Was extremely annoyed when I was checking out; as I was speaking to the staff member about my bill he answered the phone to someone in the middle of me speaking which I found extremely rude.

Breakfast options were average, fruit was rotten.   Shower products not replenished.   Spa is clean but very small. Gym was a room with a treadmill and some small weights in. ",2
6640,"Da-nang is pretty small as we discovered, you are only really 20 mins from the airport from anywhere in town, so you can stay anywhere really. the view of the river is nice but thats where it finished. The hotel is having a heavy facelift and looks like it will last 4-5 months. The rooms were smelly and breakfast was sparse and VERY asian. Not much for our two little ones to eat, we were scheduled to stay here again the night before we left Da-nang but cancelled and booked somewhere different. ",2

The furnicular to the Bairro Alto area is a 5 minute walk.   The man entrance to the hotel is not easy to find, set away from the main street in a shopping centre. The reception area was welcoming, and the lifts were fast and efficient. We had a superior room, and, although large in size, the only view we had was towards another building opposite.

6643,"Firstly can i say the staff at this hotel are fantastic especially the two receptionists we met, really helpful and very friendly.   The superior room was a good size and worth the upgrade for that extra bit of space. The glass door to the bathroom, and the full length mirror opposite the toilet was an 'interesting' design choice. Though I think the rooms needed a bit more than just stickers on the wall to give it that theatre feel. Perhaps some nice curtains over the bed would have helped it, or paintings instead of stickers?   The breakfast was quite dry, but maybe because we went to breakfast late. The best breakfast we had was when we had to check out early and the receptionist had kind enough boxed up some stuff for us. Think that breakfast tasted fresh, and was a really…",3

Closing the shutters (operated by electric switch-nice!) shut out the outside noise, but our upstairs neighbors were very loud until late. I don't know if soundproofing between floors is possible. We used the washer/dryer combo but our clothes were still wet after more than an hour of drying, so plan extra drying time if you do laundry.  ",4

6657,Firstly Berlin is a wonderful city the transport system is 2nd to none. I think this hotel is very nice a few negatives you pay over 100 euros a year and have to pay 12 euros per person to use the swimming pool and sauna. The breakfast is 19 euros per person and is a buffet. We had breakfast outside the hotel within 100 metres there are several serving breakfast for 6 euros. Lastly the hotel is very big as done expect personnel service,4

We checked in early, avoiding queues, and left our case in their luggage room until later in the day when we got our room key. The room was basic but spotlessly clean. It didn’t have air conditioning, but with little noise from outside it was no problem to keep a window open overnight. Breakfast was continental style and the usual fayre of cereals, bread rolls, meats etc.  My kids enjoyed the pool table and football table in the lobby and the bar was very reasonably priced. All this and only a five minute walk from the metro station makes this hotel a great budget option. ",3

This was kind of disappointing and gave a rough start to our stay, but luckily the kind hotel next door (Park Plaza) let us rent a parking spot, even though we did not stay with them.  Room was very small but was quiet and had the facilities we needed. Good beds and pillows.

However, the building is an old one, and the rooms aren't soundproof at all. If you are looking for somewhere quiet to retreat to after the bustle of the city, don't stay here. You will hear people talking in the corridor and it will sound like they are in bed next to you.   When people in a room near me began to 'enjoy each other's company' one morning, I could hear every grunt and moan. It was very uncomfortable to listen to and when I mentioned it to reception they didn't really care, as though they'd heard this complaint before.  Finally I would add that the building is not very accessible --- narrow, steep stairways. Not good for people with mobility issues.",3

6683,"I found out about a week before my trip that I had booked the wrong hotel.  In Salvador there is the Sol Bahia and then the Bahia Sol.  The Bahia Sol is near the Barra neighborhood and is probably the place you are looking to stay.  However, since my booking was nonrefundable I went ahead and stayed at the Sol Bahia.  It is closer to the airport so the cab fairs will be less.  They also allowed me to check in early which was wonderful as I needed some additional sleep before I went to the World Cup match that day.  They have shuttle that leaves every couple of hours to take you to the Salvador shopping mall.  Which is a very impressive place to spend some time and shop.  From there we were able to catch the shuttle to the Fonte Nova stadium and watch the game.  Their continental breakfast is pretty good and includes some local Brazilian foods.  However, that's all the good things I can say.  If you are an English only speaker than I would advise against staying here because they have no one on their staff that even remotely understands English.  I was in town for three days.  After the futball match the next day I went down early to setup a tour of the historic district downtown.  I had thought everything was arranged and that she told me to come back to the lobby at 3pm to go on the tour.  I'm down in the lobby at 3 and at 3:15 - 3:20 I go up to the desk to ask where the tour was.  They didn't understand me so I got a guy from Rio who was staying at the hotel to interpret and he said that the tour left at 1pm and that I was never signed up for it.  Fortunately I was able on my own to arrange a tour the next day through a private company.  But I was furious with the hotel that they didn't get me booked on it and the private tour cost me around 3 times as much as the bus tour would have.  (It was worth it though)  Other things.  They don't have a safety deposit box in the room.  I went down to the front desk at least 4 times asking for a deposit box which the written rules of the hotel said they had.  They were never able to provide me with one.  So I was constantly worried that anything valuable I left in my room wasn't safe.    The beds are OK.  I had a room with two full size beds.  One had a ridge in the mattress so I slept on the other.    There is nothing around this hotel you can walk to.  If you want to leave you need to get a taxi to go somewhere or hop on the shopping shuttle to go to the mall.    I watched the USA vs. Portugal game in their lobby.  They have a bar there and was able to get a Cuba Libre at half time.  I went over to the bar to get another drink immediately after the game was over and they had closed for the night.  It was a Sunday however, but there were about 20 people in the lobby watching the game.  I would have thought they'd stayed open a little later to accommodate guests since there is no where else they can go.    Finally, as I was traveling with a limited wardrobe I asked them to clean 5 pair of underwear, 4 pair of socks, 4 shirts, and some cargo shorts.  When they brought the laundry back the bill was 253 Reais.  Which translates to $113.00.  Looking at my final bill when I left I'm not sure that was what I was finally charged but was very much sticker shock.  I did have them expedited because I was only there for 3 days and it was the weekend.  However I had the same laundry done in Fortaleza without expediting and it was only around $50.    Overall an OK place to stay.  No frills.  Secure.  But don't expect it to be easy to get anywhere.…",2

6692,"The hotel is under renovation, so we were woken up on 9am on a Saturday morning by the very loud construction noises on the floor above us.  When I called the reception to ask about it, they said we should have received a letter on the check in... we didn't!  We were moved to a lower floor, but the noise - although much lower - could still be heard.",2
6693,"Having first stayed here for 3 weeks in 1994, and having visited 6 times since, this once-charming property has become nothing more than a collection of condos.  The Sand Bar, on the rare occasions it is open, is staffed by excellent people, but as far as the hotel management are concerned, is an inconvenient afterthought.  There is little to no nightlife in the area, as Trees Lounge is not somewhere I would drag my worst enemy, and the Coconut Marketplace is like a scene from The Waking Dead nowadays.",2
6694,"Lovely hotel conveniently located not far from Gare du Nord in a quiet neighbourhood (as it seemed during our stay). Staff was always friendly, polite, attentive and extremely helpful. Clean rooms with really good mattresses, and a good selection of breakfast options to start off the day.  More than happy with our stay there.",5
6695,"The hotel is very nice, like you expect. No complains there. I would have given them 5* for the stay, amenities, and the staff.  But when I checked my bill online at Marriott Rewards I noticed an invoice for beer, and food. I never touched the minibar. I contacted Marriott Rewards and I will the hotel to resolve this, but in my eyes the damage is done. Unacceptable.",1
6696,"If you travel to Berlin and need a place to be near Central Train Station, this hotel is good, clean, and good reasonalbe breakfast. It is located practically across the Central Train Station. However, if you want to be near nightlife, this location may not be for you. The place is nice and clean and efficiency designed.",4
6697,Still here. Great place. Great staff and a fantastic hotel in a cool area of the city of Barcelona. It's next to placa Del sol. Great bar scene. Lots of local restaurants and off the beaten track but well worth it. Nearest metro is Fortuna and a 5 mins walk away. Then 5 mins to the gothic area. This is authentic Barcelona and the hotel is a cool place in the heart of Gracia. Well worth the stay. We are loving it,4
6698,"The garden is nice, service was good, the walking from room to beach quite far.  we did not have a chance to try the breakfast since we left early for the fly. the noise insulation is poor made the room is too noise, we can hear the thunderstorm all night.  not worth the money as a 5-star hotel.",2
6699,"The first room we arrived in had a terrible ""city"" view of a bunch of rooftop HVAC equipment.  A bummer at first, but it wasn't the end of the world.  Rooms were small and cramped but the bathroom was nice.  Then we found the dried stained blood on the sheets.  This was a problem for us.  I called the hotel front desk and they were very apologetic and moved us to a much nicer room as we were told.  The new room at first was nicer.  Going from the 8th to the 37th floor was a plus.  Much better view; corner room.  However, it was an ADA room which made the bathroom tub very short and not very usable.  Think of a tall shower basin.  We had planned on using the fridge for some things we had brought that needed to stay cold until the next day when we checked out.  The fridge in the…",1
6700,"Basically, my experience with this hotel was NOT GOOD, mainly due to tidiness. The fridge inside was dirty and smelly - not cleaned for long time. The water outlet in the washbasin was blocked - water stayed in the basin for several minutes, keeping all dirt inside. That was disgusting. It was quite cold during the night time, too cold for my wife to sleep well. I didn't find extra blankets in the room to cover her. The ventilation outlet in the bathroom IS NOT equipped with a fan. Therefore, after a 10 minutes shower, the bathroom was totally filled with steam, and a lot of water was condensed on the walls and the door. This didn't affect my comfort, however in long term may lead to appearance of fungus. The rest was acceptable.",3
6701,"Nice and cozy hotel in great place. Very nice and helpful staff, clean rooms and in general good conditions. View from the side of the Terror Topography is amazing - city center but so calm and moreover you can see the rchitecture of Berlin.",4

6703,We only stayed 1 night but the room was adequate and clean. The location was very good. We chose the hotel on location near to the airport and with parking facilities. It was in very easy walking distance to Vasco de Gama shopping centre.,3
6704,"Before I explain the very low rating I’ve given this hotel I want to mention a couple of things: (1) all of the many problems we experienced during our stay were reported to the hotel and efforts were made to address them; and (2) the Guest Services Manager gave us a $100 food and beverage credit to spend in the hotel as a recovery for the toilet problem. Without both of these factors, I would have given this hotel a rating of 1 but, even with them, it is still no more than a 2.  I won’t stay here again as I don’t trust that they can provide a good experience and, while the $100 credit was appreciated, it didn’t feel like much given the number of problems we encountered.  Here is the list of what went wrong during our 6 night stay: •	When we got into our room we had to call to…",2
6705,"We had a large family suite with a kitchenette. The service was very good.

6706,I stayed here with a group of friends and the hotel incorrectly allocated 1 more room than was requested. We immediately informed them of their error and was told this will be rectfied by the manager the next day. When i got back from my holiday I had noticed they had charged my credit card for the room. I informed the management that this was incorrect and that we had already discussed that I wouldnt be charged but he then told me that housekeeping had reported that the room had been used and the charge stands! Considering we were in the room for 10 minutes and informed their staff that they had made an error I was charged for a room I never used! I argued with the management back and forth and when they had lost their argument they never emailed back. I was most disappointed.…,1
6707,"A room that wasn't ready when we arrived at 4:00pm, a clogged bathroom sink, having to call reception 3 times for towels that were forgotten by housekeeping, just for starters... The next day, we ordered room service at 10:00pm. The lady said our dinner would be delivered in 20 minutes. After 50 minutes, nothing had been delivered and we called room service again. They had no record of our order and promised to prepare it immediately and free of charge. Now it's 11:25pm, and absolutely nothing has been delivered yet. They definitely need to train their staff on the basics. We're not coming back.",2
6708,"This is a hotel located very closed to airport and it is Novotel, with its typical standard and I therefore went with expectation. Room was comfortable, wifi running fast. But let me point out some problems that I encountered during my one night stay there.  1. As a platinum member, I appreciate the free upgrade to 6th floor, but to find out that the premium lounge is not operating yet at this moment. I then asked about the benefits I gained from the free upgrade, and I was told there is coffee machine in my room. However, in room 661, there wasn't one. Not that I need it, but I would appreciate if accurate information was given. 2. I asked for extra key, instead of only one key provided, got rejected as they were running short of key card. So funny. Power will cut off in the…",2

We took the train along the coast to Antibes / Nice and VilleFranche which is a very pretty little place.  Our superior room was spacious and light with a small unfurnished balcony- hotel is on a busy road but we were not disturbed by noise when the balcony door was closed.  Very comfortable bed and room was exceptionally clean.   Continental buffet Breakfast was attractively displayed and delicious with ample choice.

The staff were friendly and helpful at all times  The rooms were clean and functional a little dated in decor and definitely not modern in design but it had the basics you would expect in a 4* hotel ie hairdryer,good tv, complimentary smellies etc although the safe was an additional charge of €2 per night which I thought was a little unexpected.

I was told that I was welcome to join them for breakfast for an extra cost per day - 10 days on this business trip.  On y second night, I ate in the restaurant and asked for a glass of wine.  I was told they have a lovely local Cabernet Sauvignon.  I asked for this and was brought a small bottle.  It was nice.  I asked for a second.  When signing for my meal at the end, I discovered that the price of these two bottles of wine cost more than my meal, which comprised of their most expensive steak, a desert and a bottle of beer.

The restaurant Librije Zusje was the best we ate at. Food,setting and service top notch. Hats off also to both Lesley and Mireille, the concierge's who assisted us both before and during our stay. Unfortunately there is 1 major problem, which a hotel of this level should not have, and that is service, whether turn down, breakfast, or checking and check out. The most costly was upon checking out they put us in the wrong car and so we doubled paid for transfer to the airport. Not costly, but annoying, was the wait for our room upon arriving. Seems they ""forgot"" we were asked to wait in the lobby until…",3

Obviously didn't want to be there, and would not even look us in the eye.  Because we got there around 7:00 pm we were checking in later, and they must have had limited rooms.  After a lot of discussion between the check in workiers, with their backs turned to us. they must have decided that we were an easy group to put in the room above the roof top garden, with VERY VERY loud music.

The staff was really nice and helpful, the room was clean, the shower was great and A/C worked well, which was really appreciated because of the high temperatures outside!  The hotel is located in a great spot so we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go while enjoying the beautiful weather.  Would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone and I hope I'll go back sometime!",5
6717,"This is quite a small hôtel, but the service is amazing. The breakfast is very satisfactory. The rooms were very small (even the suites), the beds were comfortable, though. The best part was the location of the hotel, it was a couple of streets away from Notre-Dame de Paris. We will certainly return.",5
6718,Big disappointment this hotel. Very disorganized Lobby and very few staff attending to people. The food area is a joke from the clunky layout to the staff that work hard but don't seem to be able to move people through the lines. Food was terrible - the pizza was a block of bread with cheese. Our room on the 40th floor was an upgrade which was $550 per night. It was small and poorly lit. The bathroom was also small with no vanity mirror and very poor lighting. The only good thing about this place is the location. I am an elite member and thinking seriously about getting on board with another chain. ,1
6719,"I must say the location of the hotel is excellent.  From Tegel Airport in Berlin, we caught the Express bus and got off at Brandenburg Gate.  Then we caught S-Bahn to Isartor, only a couple of stops we were there.  The room was spacious and comfortable.  There were apples and cakes in the hotel lobby.  Full breakfast cost 25 Euro each and it was pricey and we only ate once in the hotel.  There were quite a few Italian restaurants nearby.  If you took S-Bahn to Marienplatz, (a couple of stops) there are many, many good restaurants with reasonable price.",4

Located at 5 to 10 minutes walk from Kudamm, the Zoo and the gay area of Schöneberg, the hotel is very modern with an impressive reception hall. The location is very good, better than it looks like when you check in google maps. There are some big streets surrounding it but the traffic is not horrible and you certainly cannot hear anything from the rooms. Nearby there is a Netto supermarket (for that late night shopping), an Imbiss selling Döner and some other things. Also a lot of restaurants, the great KaDeWe and even Karstadt stores, etc.   The hotel has a small parking which is paid by the day (20€),…",4
6721,"The hotel is beautiful but marred by the horrible service that left me angry and stressed...exactly what I'd hoped to avoid by booking a more expensive hotel.  The night before my departure I called the desk to arrange for a taxi that accepted credit cards. I was told no problem and made to feel I was needlessly worrying. The next morning this was a problem.  The desk called my credit card number into a taxi dispatch and I was placed in a cab.  I was charged above the normal rate, asked for my card again, and had to get my own luggage out of the trunk.  I called Hilton who was no help with the driver...the front desk was dismissive and obviously couldn't care less of the situation they had placed me in. I will never stay again- go to the Sheraton!",2
6722,"The staff are friendly, funny and go the extra mile for you to enjoy your holiday. But ignore the 4 stars over the front entrance: this is definitely as 3-star hotel in my estimation. No carpets anywhere make this a fairly noisy hotel - down the hallways at night and into the bedrooms but live entertainment stops at 10pm and if you hang out the do-not-disturb sign, it seems to remind your neighbours to keep down their voices. The locking mechanism makes it impossible to close a door quietly from the outside. It is also a buffet hotel where the meals can get a bit monotonous - only the meat changes on the menu. Fortunately, there are several top-class restaurants within walking distance. One great idea though is if you purchase a bottle of wine, you don't have to drink it all in…",3

6724,Within a 2 minute walk from Check Point Charlie this hotel is ideally located for most of the top tourist sites which  are within walking distance.  The hotel is modern and minimalist and is a very good price in one of the most expensive areas. We had a junior suite on the 7th floor. The free mini bar (non alcoholic and water) was topped up daily as is the tea and coffee. The room was clean and bright and ideal for a city break.  The bathroom was spotless with a good hot shower and excellent toiletries. We did not have the breakfast as this you can get cheaper at nearby cafès and patisseries. There is a bar where you can chill out in the early evening before going out for dinner (happy hour cocktails 6pm to 8pm) plus coffee or tea during the day and late evening. Would highly…,5

The rooftop bar was a hit but you needed to be there early to grab a good view.  The hotel service/bar staff were friendly and obliging however the reception staff still need to change -  we purchased a 24 hour tram ticket from the front desk from a once again surly staff member to discover the next day that it was a public holiday and the trams were not running.

On opening the door to the room found that a third bed had not been put in the room and the room was not the one stated on the booking.  We went back to reception who said they would arrange for a bed supposedly a full size bed not a rollaway bed.

We stored our luggage early on our first day of arrival, was pointed to the local markets, and was able to use their refrigerator to shop, store our food and eat like the Parisians. The host asked us our itinerary and arranged transportation or our last night stay. The neighborhood offered quick convenience to the metro and walking to the Louvre. Would stay here again.",5
6731,"We paid north of $400 for a family to stay in one room (I should say Junior Suite) for one night. Bedevilled by the clever imagery of bright candy coloured Art Deco, and a pool, on Booking.com this felt like the right place for blowing the budget on our last night of our California family vacation.  Wrong.  The sofa bed was the equivalent of lying on a nail of beds. For the price this was not what we expected at all. We live near London, and so we feel that SF prices are something we should be familiar with - but there’s no value here. Massively disappointing, but 9 out of 10 for the deception in creating a Cannes style joie de vivre on screen from an old motel that is still an old motel with a lick of pant and a couple of hammocks in an off screen horror reality.",1

The staff were super friendly and accommodating. There was a female receptionist with dark hair who was just a joy, always smiling and very chatting. There is a seating area for food in the reception and breakfast is served at a cost. The rooms are super clean and spacious for a single. There is a safe in the room, wardrobe a big mirror and coffee making facilities. There are plenty of restaurants and coffee shops in the surrounding area, so you can always find somewhere to eat. I can't quite understand why this is a 2* hotel. I believe this hotel is at least a 3*. I would definitely stay here again should I return to Paris.",5

6752,"I had a very relaxed and chilled out stay at the Pestana Royal. I loved the hotels stance on sustainability - no plastic straws or disposable cups is wonderful. Bring a water bottle and you can fill it up at key places in the hotel and stay hydrated. I also thought the lunch bags for guests going exploring on the island was an excellent idea. I was well fed and watered all week  however the hotel falls short in some key areas for an All Inclusive offering.   ROOMS:   Inexplicably somebody signed off a refurb that saw the bathrooms become glass boxes with no doors. Classic case of design over function.  You can specifically request a room with a ""traditional"" bathroom, i.e one with a door and proper walls so you don't have to watch as your loved one/best friend wipe their arse. …",3
6753,We were a little disappointed with the Apartment. We booked a 3 bedroom Apartment but what we got was a 2 bedroom apartment with an adjoining Studio Unit.  This was fine bed wise and bathroom wise but there was not enough seating in the lounge/dining area as it was really only setup for 3 or 4 people so made it uncomfortable for 6 adults to hang out there at night.   Probably would not stay here again. Staff were amazing!!,2
6754,Room very noisy as opposite a 24 hour petrol station. We were woken at 7am on Saturday by union pickets with a bullhorn. Room about a 100 yards from elevator. Room adequate nothing to recommend this hotel. We have stayed before but will not be going back.,1
6755,"We stayed in Epic Sana for a week in August. The hotel is apparently 5*. I would give them 4* during the week and 3* at the weekend as the service slips dramatically. Having to wait for tea and coffee and for the buffet to be replenished was the norm at the weekend and in general for the amount of guests they have staying they don't have the facilities to match. The pool area is an absolute farce. There is very little beds and most days you have to sit on the floor. 6 out of 7 days they didn't have any towels at the pool, they make you go down to your room to get your own bath towel. Price wise it's one of the most expensive hotels I've stayed in for bar food/drinks...€12 for a vodka tonic, €7.50 for a corona and €4.50 for a coke. Epic sana is 30 minute walk from Bairro Alto and…",3

I unfortunately need to have a package delivered to me during my stay, even more unfortunately it was time sensitive, due to the strike UPS would not deliver my package, and I would only be able to retrieve it from UPS after my deadline had passed, you would have thought this is A: something they should have mentioned to me when I called the hotel to let them know that I’d have a UPS package arriving, and B: you’d think UPS would know that they won’t deliver to this address.

No frills, but ok breakfast and a good location for exploring West Berlin, and especially the Zoologische Garden, which is located just a few blocks away next to the Intercontinental.",4
6758,This is a good option if you don't want to pay a fortune for accommodation. It's a bit off but taking the tube to different parts of Berlin is easy from here.

Rooms are clean and nice. Breakfast is great as well. ,4

Beds are pathetic. I travel around the world, and these are the worst beds I have ever slept on. The rooms are worn and run down, not bright and attractive. If my company were not paying, I would never stay here. Food is over priced and below average. Menu is limited.

The only problem with our stay was there was 2 very large party bookings at the time.  The hotel were more readily to cater for these parties rather than individual couples.  I loved Madeira and we were perfectly situated.  The lido bars, especially “Qasbar” were perfect.  I would not use this hotel again because of the fore said, but will be returning to Madeira.",3

Breakfast was good and like that they offered several options for those with food intolerances.  Staff was very helpful and friendly.",4

Temperature in the shower was impossible to fine tune resulting in either cold or burning hot. Wifi was dodgy and often not working at all. Every day the keycard wouldn't work and had to be recharged in the reception. Breakfast was good except one morning the scrambled eggs were rotten (smelled like fish), and at peak hours most of the dishes needed refilling.  No pool, no view from most rooms and the fitness center was under construction.  Over all I would not recommend staying here.",2
6769,This hotel had a very nice room. They have been redone very well. The staff also did a good job making us feel welcome. The one thing we didn’t care for was the food in there restaurant. Not much of a menu and what we got was high priced and not good.,4

We had to move rooms to access wi-fi, but as it was just the room next door, we still only had very limited connection, perhaps the internet was installed when the hotel was built long, long ago!

The room (comfort, I believe it was called) was great, a very comfortable bed, good shower and excellent aircon during a very hot spell in Berlin. The reception staff were also excellent. However... The cleaning service leaves a lot to be desired. One day it was if the room hadn't been cleaned, another day the shower gel was missing.

It was hard to get a smile out of any of them.  When I arrived in my room (#501) the bathroom was trashed.  To add insult to injury there was major construction in progress upstairs.  Jack hammering, drilling you name it.  I asked one of the staff what the story was and all he could tell me was that the work stopped at 5 PM.  The next morning I woke to discover that they start right back up at 7:30 AM.

It is in a beautiful area, sort of like staying on Fifth Ave in NYC or the Champs Elysees in Paris. Very upscale boulevard with all the high end shops like LV, Chanel, Bottega Veneta. It is a bus/subway ride from most of the big tourist destinations, which was ok for us, but for younger (i.e. more hip) travelers, they would want to be closer to the East Berlin areas.

The apartment design and decor is very beautiful and soothing with comfy bed, small kitchen that includes dishes, spoons... etc. with dishwasher and mini fridge, and a baby crib upon request that costs 10€ per night.  The cons however are really frustrating. That includes limited parking spots that are expensive per night compared to other hotels, that is if there were parking spots available at first place.

6817,"Ok; first I got an upgrade - which in this case had the consequence, that my room were in the basement/parterre (-1 in the elevator). Seriously! Ok; it was bigger than the normal doubleroom but how ridiculous. First room I went to; a smell was in the air and I was transferred to another similar room (also in the basement) - this room were missing a chair next to the desk. So we went to a third room (also in the basement) were I was installed.  The room was spacious, clean and with all amenities expected. But designwise it really needs to be modernized. And the staff in the frontdesk really nice But it can not compensate for the overall impression of this hotel; Its old in its style and it makes it really difficult to give the impression of being a 5* hotel.",3
6818,"Well located hotel close to checkpoint Charlie and Stadmitte UBhan. Rooms were clean and spacious, added bonus of two separate duvets and a coffee machine! Good selection of mini bar refreshments. Bathroom robes and slippers available and a good selection of minis.  Breakfast was plentiful and was on at good times (6am-12pm)  Staff were friendly and gave us a warm welcome and goodbye. ",4

6820,"This hotel has so much potential, sadly it is seriously lacking. The only star I have this hotel was because of the pool, beach bar and the close proximity to the beach.  The rest of it is a BIG NO 👎👎 Lets start with the reception staff. They need a good lesson in basic customer service. I though it was just me that was being ignored every time I approached the desk but after watching and listening to the other guests do the same - I was relieved to see that ignoring the guests was standard practice. You only got acknowledged when you interrupted them ! Manners and communication are key in the leisure industry ! Sadly, they seriously lack both.  The 2 rooms we had booked were nothing short of disgraceful. They were dirty, enamel peeling off of the bath, rusted & dilapidated…",1

I know it was undergoing renovations but they should have knocked 80% off the price.  Definitely not worth it.  My room was on an interior open space which also caused noise.",1
6822,"The location is okay and close to subway station, room is not bad but the problem is most of their staffs don't have sense of customer service at all. Only one girl greeted us with smile and did her best to get our room ready before check in time, but the rest if the staffs at the concierge need to know the meaning of customer service, the are rude, don't even look at you when speak, bossy and don't even expect a single smile from them. They really pisssed me off when I need to check in another room for my guest, even futher when we asked for our cash deposit when checking out, would NOT stay at this hotel ever again..",2
6823,"My friends and I made a reservation with our CREDIT CARD four hours before arriving this location and when we arrived to check in they replied by saying ""We canceled your reservation"" their excuse and total lie was ""You never gave us a credit card number"" by now I've forgotten the female manager that ""attended"" us the  night of Saturday November 5th. Anyway she ended up admitting that one of her employees messed up the reservation. I'm very disappointed because we always choose Best Western and this one let us down. Do not bother making a reservation with these people, it might be 11pm, you're late for a show and tired after driving 6 hours and they might not accommodate your stay.   ",1
6824,"Well, after being given a disabled room on the first night (the joys of the single traveller) where I didn't get much sleep!!  I asked to be moved the day after and was moved to another room, without too much fuss.  The hotel is very close to most of the main points of interest that were on my list to visit - Checkpoint Charlie, Topography of Terror, Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag Building so from that point and the fact that it was at least -5c every day a short walk was very much welcomed!!",4
6825,"It was in front of the Gare de Lyon and access was great. The rooms are clean and the water heaters, mini bar and amenities are very good. The accommodation fee was reasonable and I was very happy with the breakfast. However, the elevator was always busy and I could not get on easily.  リヨン駅の目の前にあり、アクセスは最高でした。部屋も清潔で、湯沸かし器やミニバー、アメニティも非常に充実しています。金額もリーズナブルで朝食もついていて非常に満足しました。ただエレベーターは常に渋滞していてなかなか乗れませんでした。",5

If you like parying 24/7 please go there. If you like traveling, meting interesting people, see some culture, etc go somewhere else.

Underground (U) and buses.  Hotel itself was clean, well appointed with plenty of seating to relax and have a drink. Bar prices were on the high side but I suspect that was more to do with the exchange rate £-€. What impressed me the most was the level of service from all members of staff.  On a side line if you want to be further in closer to the Centre of this part of Berlin then Motel Mitte do have a hotel at Alexandraplatz.",4

The location is good and room is large with a great view but for what we paid (over $350 a night Canadian) I would have expected more.  No fan in the washroom. No robes. Toiletries are cheap. ,1

The hotel is close to various restaurants, shops, boulangeries and the metro station, which was very convenient. Also, walking distance from Moulin Rouge and Sacre Coeur, if you want to be touristy. :)",5

The clerk at the desk told us it would be $30 a night, but when we checked out, we were charged $45. Instead of refunding us the difference for the misunderstanding, we were forced to pay. Paying $45 a night for the privilege of parking my own vehicle is absurd, and I will not be staying at this hotel again. Additionally, I will be submitting detailed reviews on several websites to warn other people of your horrible business practices and customer service.",1

I reserved the adjoining rooms Joy and Lady Soul. Although they technically don't ""adjoin"" to make one larger room, they share a private small hall. As you can see from the hotel web site's pictures, the rooms are somewhat funky but not overwhelming. The Idol offers all of the amenities one would expect at a first class hotel. The showers are all glass and in full view of the room so if you are traveling with someone you don't want to see in the buff, you'll have to turn around or leave the room!

It felt like it was empty awaiting renovation.  When I returned to the front desk I was very lucky to find Geraldine, the manager, who was very helpful and accommodating.

The room was a good size with a nice view, but lacked those comforts e.g. ironing board, second luggage rack, rack in shower for shampoo etc., bottled water, lift, hotel information.  We would not recommend this hotel as there are plenty of other quaint hotels with lifts and many more being built.",3

That is fine if enough amenities are provided. But you get the standard 2 towels/room, limited waste basket, limited washing liquid (clothes and dish).   For a four star (claimed) property, you have to lock your apartment door from the 'outside'. Stupid. There is no safe. The staff at the reception are not friendly. They took a passport for registration but forgot to return it and made no effort to return it or even keep it safe.

The hotel is in a great location and unfortunately the rest of the Bay Area seems to agree.   The outdoor seating area was overcrowded with non residents. There is a small residents only area, but it does not seem to be enforced and service was slow.   The restaurants also seemed to be ill prepared for the number of people there. As a result, we dined at the restaurant at the golf course (because we didn't want to wait 45 minutes for a table in the main hotel) and were served pink, undercooked chicken.

The breakfast buffet had reasonably good variety in it, and the dining area was nice. The free ferry itself was very easy to find and take, and provided great service right to the central train station, and it meant that you could be in Central Amsterdam within 15 minutes.

NOTE: The A/C doesn't work if your window is open, so make sure your window is shut tight to get the A/C to work.  I didn't know that and I suffered one hot evening because the guy at the front desk in the middle of the night also didn't know that.  The person at the front desk the next day told me about it.   Also, when were were there, the lobby had a sewage smell, so hopefully they fixed that. That was not in the room, though.  The experience in the room…",4
6879,"It's a wedding so never have it much thought. Just booked a room for two nights. This place needs a face lift and new management. Our room was old, ugly, dingy, and didn't work. For example I took a shower and ended up standing in a foot of water. Room service never showed up. The coffee self service was never refreshed for the second morning and a call for fresh cups and coffee went unheeded. It's obvious no one cares about this place and neither should you - stay somewhere else.",1
6880,Stayed at this hotel for three nights. Room is clean. Staff is very courteous. Hotel location is very convenient within walking distance to dozens of restaurants. Hotel lobby is on 20th floor that offers nice view of the city. It has limited space is the only drawback. ,1
6881,"We were only here one night for a quick stop in Paris, and I would certainly go back!  The staff were friendly and helpful, the room was very clean and comfortable, and the bathroom was larger than most Parisian ones.  A very small lift, but I'm just happy they have one.  From our window, we could see the Eiffel Tower.  The offered breakfast was a little expensive so we found a local cafe.  It is well worth the price and in a spot close to the Metro.",5
6882,"A trip well waited for by seven eager lads, looking to soak up a little bit of culture, football nostalgia and of course - alcohol.   On arrival at the reception, we were greeted by a friendly receptionist, willing to be of assistance and guide us to places that sold beverages! Payment on arrival was convenient meaning that our check-out in the end was very simple.  The apartment was modern, uncluttered and filled with ample storage. It was very comfortable and delivered the simple things that a group of lads needed. Two en-suite bedrooms meant that we could shower more efficiently.  With regard to location, it was fairly central and within a ten minute walk of the nearest metro line. The ‘Sagrada Familia’ was very close - lots of decent places for Breakfast outside the building…",4
6883,"The place was amazing and we enjoyed many nights at the balcony that was connected with the apartment. You can smoke on the balcony.  The beds was Scandinavian hardness and not to soft.  The staff was really informative about the area and ""how to get to"" and help book at taxi to get to the airport.  A few things that you need to know. You can hear when they close doors and make coffee on the floor above you (we stayed at 402) so you might need to bring earplugs if the other guest are up early 😊  We where 4 friend traveling together and there was only one cover per bed, and it costs 5 euro to get another cover so you have one each.  But overall the area was amazing and very authentic since you actually live in a place where the residents in Barcelona lives.  ",4
6884,"i had my first solo trip to BA in 2008 and stayed here, and it showed I was rather naive. I exchanged many emails beforehand and built what I thought to be was an honest travellers relationship with the owner of my lodging. There were many great things about staying here, the staff were wonderful and I became very close with them, but the owners were more about making the money. Don't get me wrong, I realise it is a business, but when I found that the person who rented my room before me was paying 50% less I was astonished. Especially seeing I had booked for one month and told I would get a very special deal. hmmm... There was also the tango ""lesson"" with the friend on the first day. Cost = 100pesos. The friend turned out to be the driver...I paid less than that for professional…",2
6885,"The hotel was a disappointment when you are expecting a 5-star quality/service. We had a nice view though but the hotel is a little run down , same breakfast for 2 weeks (not much to choose from either). Some of the staff were very friendly and helpful but some  could use a course in customer service. The location is quite good, close to shops and restaurants and to the bus stop.",3
6886,"This very basic hotel is situated a good 20 minutes walk from the city centre. To get to the city centre you will need to pass all the homeless people sleeping in doorways (and I mean lots making my family and myself very uncomfortable). Don't count on a good nights sleep either as the rooms are facing the main road and if it's not someone shouting, it's either a siren or a lorry passing. Avoid this hotel if you can",1
6887,"We have a second home here and love taking our friends and family to all our local restaurants. Yesterday was the last day for our current guests and we wanted to have our last meal with them at the Fish House. We were turned away. Despite the fact that there was only 4 customers, they decided only guests of the hotel would be able to dine. There are many ways to discriminate against people. Thank you fish house for making us feel unappreciated as loyal customers. Monkey pod closed completely, no problem, we get that with the storm. Kudos to Roy’s who took everyone who walked in including a surprise party of 70 people. So next time you are hungry in Ko’Olina don’t be surprised if the Four Seasons turns you away. Aloha is not their forte.",2
6888,"Stayed in this Renaissance for 3 nights for business. This is not the kind of Marriott property we usually stay at. We didn't have a good experience since we checked in. The male staff at front desk ( I think name Henry) disappointed us. He was actually pretty impolite to us upon checked in. The way he work was like reluctantly. This is actually the worst experience ever. I believed it won't even happen in a 3 stars hotel. Finally, we got the room keys. When we entered the room, there was some moldy smell.It became better after we lower the AC.  Also, we actually requested the room for 3 people. Unfortunately, everything they provided was only for 2. I called to the navigator ( I think is housekeeper) for 1 more set of like slippers, toothbrush and towels. We received only 1…",2
6889,"The hotel is very stylish with an expansive and comfortable reception area. We were staying there for a city break and couldn’t have asked for a better located hotel. The tram into the centre of Berlin is right outside the door and the concierge prints off tickets, so no searching for a ticket booth. The rooms were very comfortable, the decor clean and modern, nice toiletries and well equipped with all you need. The breakfast is something else, so many choices, all freshly prepared hot or cold, meat, fish, cheese, fruit, yoghurt, bread, pastries, cereal, jams, honey, anti-pasti and even a fresh herb station! Our stay for 3 nights was extremely enjoyable and we plan to stay there again when we return to Berlin.",5
6890,OD Barcelona is very new and modern.  Everything works well and the staff is friendly and helpful.  They provide a breakfast buffet with a variety of items including omelets cooked to order.  We are English speakers and although some of the staff was not fluent in our language we never had an issue that was not handled well.  Their recommendations for other restaurants were all excellent.  The location is close enough to shopping and eating that many options are available within easy walking distance.  This is an excellent choice.,4
6891,"Watching a football game in the bar after a day of sightseeing. Ordered a beer.  Nice way to relax before dinner. Bartender asks if I really wanted to watch the game. He said he'd prefer to watch the debate. The last thing I wanted to see was that presidential debate when I'm trying to relax. I said as much. His response was ""you can watch for one more minute and then I'm turning the game off.""  He proceeded to follow through. I left. Last time I stay here. ",1
6892,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 5 nights at the end of August. Our room was tiny (which was expected) the views were stunning (unexpected) and as others have commented, the bathroom was SO smelly.  They say parking is included, but they fail to mention that it's free public parking for the beach too so it fills up (and overflows) very quickly.  A few positives about the hotel: the location is amazing, the views are breathtaking, and the roof top patio with pool is nice.  This hotel is great if you want someone clean and safe with a pool close to the beach and heart of Lagos. If you want luxury, look elsewhere.",3
6893,"Most of the online photos are current.  Walking in on the first floor looks like a clean trendy chic hotel.  The front desk staff is helpful.  The quality of rooms varies from the basic to Executive.  I upgraded to an Executive room which was large and had a great ocean front/beach view.  Several friends had a standard room and the space was small and the walls had water stains. Wifi is available and is advertised as ""broadband"" service.  The average speed was 5-7MB which is closer to 3G cell service.  Morning breakfast had a variety of meats, cheeses, pastries, fruits, and other goodies. Would I stay here again, only in an Executive room, otherwise no.",2
6894,"The hotel staff are good but the rooms are not equipped with the basic necessities ( no mini bar, telephone, kettle) The rooms are not cleaned everyday. The room service just make the beds and leave the room, toilet and floor dirty. When I spoke to the receptionist, he found that absolutely normal. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to People who expect a bit of cleanliness during their stay in a 3 star hotel  Lack of hygiene. ",3
6895,"The hotel is situated close to the Marquis de Pombal subway station but still a 10 minute walk up through the park and on an incline. So the hotel is not central and quite a walk to the sites so you will need to take a taxi or the subway. If we visit again we'd choose a hotel closer to the river . The Four Seasons Hotel sits in front of the hotel blocking the view to the river. Although you can see a view either side of it or your room may overlook the park beside the hotel. However the rooms were large and pleasant and clean. The general areas were fine. Breakfast was a good spread of food but get the waiter to take your eggs order early if you want them, one of our waiters forgot to ask us and we ended up waiting a while for the omelette to arrive after we'd nearly finished…",3
6896,"We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and 3 days, we chose the hotel for the roof top outdoor pool and also for the gym both of which were disappointing. The pool on the roof is tiny and waist deep at most, it’s fine for cooling off but notice swimming or sharing, there is no bar service on the roof and only 3 thin umbrellas for shade, the loungers are poor quality too. It does have good views and is a sun trap however hence need for umbrellas.  The gym is again tiny with limited equipment and space, a wooden floor which makes working out harder as things make a loud noise all the time, no music and no AC it is in the spa and hence spa temperatures. Not enjoyable at all so I ended up running out side where there is a nice long track along the river.  The room itself was fine but…",3
6897,"After reading quite a few negative reviews for this hotel we didn't know what to expect. However, we were pleasantly surprised and had a great stay at the Novotel in Cannes. The rooms were spacious and well air-conditioned. The cleaning staff did an excellent job at keeping our room clean and tidy all week. We found all the staff at Novotel friendly, they would greet you whenever passing, including the hotel manager who was seen frequently amongst guests. The pool was just the right temperature (and not too cold as commented in a previous review) with plenty of sun beds and parasols available. The hotel did not charge us at all for using sunbeds and provided us with clean pool towels every day. We ate in the pool cafe several times for lunch, the food was a high standard, tasty…",5
6898,"When I think of the Ritz, I think of elegance, great food, fabulous service, in an outstanding venue.  This was none of that.  The tables were scratched and stained wooden bar tables with NO tablecloths or even place mats.  The view was beautiful, but that was all.  I ordered a $42 seafood platter (OK, not special) and when I asked for bread, I was told they no longer provided bread but I could purchase a $13 load of herb bread.  There wasn't even a cracker for the shredded salmon.  My friend ordered apricot chicken which was just an uncut chicken thigh and drumstick slapped on a big plate with no garnish or vegetable or anything else.   There were two pieces of apricot in a bowl outside the plate.  There was a teaspoon of sauce on the chicken.  This was $32.  I took it home for…",2

INTERNET is NOT FREE.  arm and leg to use. Hotel room views are mostly ugly areas.",2
6900,"When I arrived they gave me a twin bed room instead of a queen bed. I complaint, they told me that they did not have any other room at that time but the next morning the management would be contacting me to change me to another room or adjust the fare. I was there for 3 days, no one contacted or tied to solve the issue.  It is clear to me that they do not care about their repeating customers. I am not staying at that hotel anymore.",2

6903,"Really good central location, right next to Gracia and Mercado Llibertat. Lots of space, great amenities and possibility of a parking inside. Great Quality for the price. Good service from Enjoy BCN.  Cons: The baby crib wasn't installed when we came in, the phone didn't work so we had a problem getting food delivery and the water in the pool was not heated.  Overall, great stay, we would go back for sure!",4

Upon check in, the gentleman said he did not have the Credit Card authorization from my company. I called to confirm with my company that they had faxed it, after patiently waiting... the employee finally walked back to check for the form. (I told them I would not sign or check in until I was sure they had this documentation). He brought back the form, I saw it in his hand. I imagine it is on camera if they have them.

6906,"We only stayed for one night before a morning flight from the airport, but that was enough to appreciate the hotel. Typical Holiday Inn with all the usual amenities. The room was spacious, convenient beds, very good breakfast - really all was good. Indeed, there is a conference centre there, which must be a good feature for travel industry or HORECA-related evebts. The main advantage is, of course, that it is only around 1 km from the airport, so you don't care in the morning about traffic.",4
6907,I'm not sure if it was myself or the hotel having a bad day.  The experience from check in to check out was not good for a five star hotel - both took far too much time and were inefficient.  Despite being current my Accor Club membership was not acknowledged for some reason.  The club floors and benefits lacking and very strict as to the time food and drinks could be served - even five minutes late with plenty of staff on hand it wasn't possible.  The air-conditioning in the rooms was not working correctly or has been adjusted as a result the sleep and the next morning spent catching up on some work was very uncomfortable - outside in the hall was very good though.    The location is incorrectly listed on some sites as Xin Tan Di.  Ended up relocating to a different hotel for…,2
6908,Service was generally poor.  Staff was unfriendly and seemed unhappy to be there.   There were a few exceptions but the front desk was unfriendly and unhelpful which left a negative impression   Too many other choices.  Won't return. ,2
6909," This is a nice city hotel located in Central Lisbon about a 15-minute pleasant walk down a leafy boulevard into the city center. The rooms are well appointed though small, and the bathrooms well finished. Breakfast is a combo of made-to-order + buffet.   Positives + outstanding staff who really go out of their way to help you, particularly with street information  + good beds and sheets for quality sleep + good bathroom and amenities + hotel is within 20 minutes walking distance of old city   Negatives - strangely the bathroom door does not lock and the two doors have a slight gap when closed meaning there is not 100% privacy - breakfast seems on the sparse side but ask them for some eggs and they'll cook to order (though it does take a bit of time)  ",3
6910,It was once again a fantastic stay at your renewed Hotel. We very much enjoy the service provided as well as the new set up. The location cannot be better as well as the beach and all what we have the opportunity to enjoy over there. We hope to come back to your hotel in our next stay to the magnificent city of Cannes.,5
6911,"Nice hotel in the city center. Spacious rooms, clean, nice breakfast. Unfortunately our room was located next to the railways. We did not have a lot of noise, but we it was impossible to open a window because of the noise and the smell. And the airco was pretty hard (everyone had a cold when leaving).",4

Their security guard entered and declared, ""You are tresspassing"" I replied, ""I am a paying guest"" Management, refused to budge and called the police. I had lost my driver's license, despite the fact the police identified me, hotel still asked me to leave.  Management voided the card key so if I left would be locked out.  I did not go out for dinner and room service was denied.  I was a prisoner in the room despite being a member of Marriott Reeards.  I left, yet was charged over $700.0.",1

""Vietnam's best jacuzzi"" closed (cold) during our stay and after shrugging it off repeatedly they finally gave a token discount.  No holiday spirit here...eat around the corner at Kido sushi, breakfast fine.   Be in the bus herd, otherwise you will have to negotiate relentlessly. ",2

Especially John helped us with suggestions for where to go to enjoy the Berlin Nightlife. He gave us some really good advice.  The Spa is really nice with both steam and sauna, and what I really like the jacuzzi outside. What a great experience. There is also a nice gym on the same level as the Spa.

The room was clean.  Bathroom counters weren't long enough.  Lighting in the bathroom and room was dim for putting on make-up.  The biggest concern is getting to the room from the elevator.

Hampton Inns have more comfortable beds.  Checked tags and mattress is nearly 5 years old with uneven surface.  The worst night of sleep in my 78 Marriott nights this year.  You renovate a room but leave the old mattress???  2) In Junior Suite and there is one small air conditioning vent that barely cools room.  Had to open all windows and the street is so loud.  Also can’t keep the room dark having the windows open because the drapes have to be open to get air.  3) The water pressure is terrible and unacceptable.  4) The pillows are too soft and you have to double them up.  5) Hotel operator last…,1

6934,Myself and my partner are a young couple who had a very pleasant experience on our visit to Paris on Easter weekend! We experienced the wonderful Paris Friday traffic jams lol. When we arrived we received a warm welcome from the lovely man at reception it was quick! He gave us a map with all the locations and told us the nearest metro station. Stayed in room 504 was a nice room my only criticism is that control of the aircon should be done from the room as I had to ask the receptionist but that was no bother as we did this when left in the morning to then come back to a very cool room as the weather was amazing and very hot. I certainly would recommend this hotel for its location and the cafes & restaurant are just amazing. Thank you Hotel Longchamp Elysees. ,5

Lovely balcony with views over beach, port, helipad and sea. Breakfast was good - as expected in any large hotel. Great massage in spa by Maryam who really listened to what I wanted from the treatment.

I called a week in advance to make sure the room would have a nice view, enough beds, etc. I wanted to make sure the stay would be stress free. However, when I arrived, it was nothing but stress. The room given to me had a terrible view of something like a brick wall. The cot was never delivered. Basically none of the requests had been looked after. My bridesmaid had to negotiate a new room.

So we gave them our Hilton American Express card which we had just used at the desk to check in.  They said the card would not go through. Finally had to pay cash.  Waited forever for our order. Drinks very poor quality. We switched rooms with our daughter so she could be close to her young children.  Explained it 3 times to the front desk and they never got it right.

Thanks Jet2 reps!  The first thing that meets you is that the hotels are set in lovely gardens and is very clean and well looked after.  The staff were mainly very helpful and polite.  The studio rooms were spacious and well equipped apart from there was no air conditioning, just two ceiling fans, one in the bedroom and one in the lounge area. To be fair, they did do the trick at night, but we could not have them on full as the noise of the fan motors kept us awake.  The pool areas were good, with plenty of sunbeds scattered about, and a tranquil atmosphere.  The downside to this resort…",3
6940,"Good location easy to come and leave. Short walk to city centrum. Lot of seen in the city. It is useful to buy Berlin welcome card you can use it everywhere train, tram,buss. Hotel was quiet and very modern good wifi and good breakfast.",4
6941,"In such a vast city that you have not visited before, needing to accommodate a family of four without breaking the bank, where do you begin? You can research till your blue in the face and incredibly frustrated by the choice on offer. There is no better way than trying it out for yourself, and that’s what we did.  On a cold Sunday night after a transfer from Tegel airport , there was nothing more welcoming than the chap on reception. Throughout the stay the staff continued to smile and greet when we entered the building.  The rooms were immaculate and spacious. More than adequate for two adults. A 16 and a 12 year old. With the addition of a sliding door for added privacy it was like a two roomed apartment. The kitchen was more than suitable for preparing much more than basic…",5
6942,"The hotel is located in a good area. Not crowded but close to everything.  Rooms are smaller and then presented in photos. We had room 151 was ok size. Room 153 was small. our room was freezing cold at first and after a while heated. The rooms have  good beds, great bathroom with super hot shower, a Big flat tv, coffee & tea set. Room was cleaned every day. Overall -good value for money, don't expect too much, enjoy the city! Friendly staff gave us good tips. ",3
6943,I loved staying there. The room was clean. The environment was so luxurious. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who intend to stay in Paris. Next time I am in Paris I plan to stay at hotel St. Therese. The neighborhood has a variety of activities. There are multiple restaurants available. There are train stations available. There many sights around to visit and enjoy. The louvre is not too far.,5
6944,"This hotel seems to lack any staff training in the value of service.  As an example, the porter who checked in and out our luggage spent most of our “contact” time looking at his mobile phone, making us feel like an intrusion to his personal interests.  But there were some naturally warm people in house-keeping.  The room was dowdy, but nothing to complain about.  Breakfast was very poor compared to most Chinese hotels I have stayed in.  I would not rush to go back. ",2
6945,"Ww had high hopes and were disappointed with Marriott described this property. We asked for a Ocean view, but received a view of the shipyard and pool. The room furnished for a business traveler not a vacationer. You can hear the noise from rooms next door or in the hall. Parking was a hit or miss which means we had to park for away from property. The beach front is nice but the water was not clear and desirable to swim in.  We visited other hotels properties for meals. The Hyatt in Poipui, St Regis in Princeville or the Marriott in the south shores near Poipui were nicer hotels. We would check out other Condo or smaller hotels.",2
6946,"The rooms look old, the place could use a renovation. The acoustics are BAD. You can hear everything in your room, outside and inside. The design of this hotel is poor, as the dining area is placed in the bottom of a patio that is joint also to the rooms! We could hear the spoons placed from our room which was on the top floor! You can everything from the adjacent rooms as well. The rooms have glass doors that lead you to the balcony.. the glass isn't acoustic either and you can hear every vehicle passing on the street & every animal. Did not get any sleep!",2
6947,"We stayed here on November 3rd & 4th. Just off the Ramblas, with local bakeries and cafes just outside the entrance.  Judt one short block into the heart of the Central Market, La Boqueria.  Room decent sized, clean.  Great helpful staff.  Would stay again.",4
6948,During a recent first visit to Sanfransisco from Ireland which we thoroughly enjoyed we were disappointed with the Hotel found it quite impersonal maybe better for business conferences we had no  access to WiFi had to visit local Starbucks  to contact our family  On arrival we were offered an upgrade for $50 pet night which we declined it was the commencement of a month trip for our anniversary which we had already paid out a substantial amount ‘certainly were not going to upgrade as we were staying 4 nights  Not a very friendly hotel we found & of all the different ones we have stayed in so far on our trip it has been our least favourite & would not recommend it we didn’t feel safe in the surrounding area at night either  unfortunately ,1
6949,"Great location with a great view from the roof terrace . Sadly not matched by the room, the only window opened inside the hotel with a view of the centre of the building.The staff were very good, very polite, helpful and clear with their speech..The room itself was ok, clean and tidy. There was a kettle in the room but no tea or coffee. When we questioned this at the desk we were told that we need to ask and they would supply tea coffee and sugar but for milk you need to either get some from the bar or buy some in a shop. Over all it was very good.",4
6950,"Standard 5* with rather POOR SERVICE, staying here for more than a week we saw many ups and downs of staff.  ROOM was tidied regularly but with very varying quality (sometimes dirty towels were taken but not replaced for example). Apart from that very standard 5* room, only the television was very annoying. We couldn't turn it off without help and even the staff needed 5 minutes after which they decided to pull the plug. FOOD was only AVERAGE, no live cooking for eggs at breakfast, and any ordered egg took about 30 minutes to come, that was usually 10 minutes before the coffee. Horribly LONG WAITING times at breakfast - for anyone with a bit of time-pressure an absolute no go.  STYLE, of the hotel, is rather 'bling bling', with the paint peeling off at some places (entrance…",3
6951,"I do not recommend it for business trips. Air conditioning did not work properly, if you want to iron you need to go the third floor. This is the first hotel I see that to do not allow you to iron your shirts in the room.",2
6952,"The check in experience was not good. Very long (they didn't have my internet reservation made on their website), and the check-in employee was limit rude. The room was clean but the furniture are old and in general the hotel is in bad condition. Eg my bathroom had a lot of water leak (bath, washbasin...) and all this go on the floor (then in the walls). Breakfast is not so good. The terrace (and fitness center) are very small and only accessible between 8am to 8pm (very limited, quite impossible for a working traveler) Only good point: The situation near (they are not on) the Ipanema beach. Not a good quality/price",2
6953,"Generator is more a hotel than a hostel. The beds are comfortable and the place looks nice but there is zero atmosphere, it's pretty expensive and the staff is not very friendly either.  There's also lots of families staying at the venue.   If you're looking for a place to meet other travellers. Generator is not your place. If you're just looking for a comfortable place to sleep, then it is. ",3
6954,Reception staff on arrival were great. All other staff in resturant were quite rude and it would have helped if resturant was opened 24/7 as coming from a different country our eating times and sleep patterns were different. Staff were not very helpful as they main resturant was closed at 3.30pm they sent us to the Pullman and there nothing was open either. Which required us to order room service which we had to pay more. The lady at the bar wasn’t accommodating as we were on our laptop and didn’t require a drink due to just finishing breakfast. Then we were questioned how long would we be. Were else could we go? Our room was being serviced.  Disappointed as a Accor Member  Diana and Sukhjinder,2
6955,"This hotel is partelly owned by private owners (appartments) and part is hotel. The staff on the reception are pure, they dont know what they are doing, not helpful, not smile. They are absolutelly chaotic, changing reservation and room numbers by them self. Not professional!",2
6956,Hotel was reasonably central and we could walk to the majority of locations - only 2 a bit far especially as we went on a very unusually hot weekend with temperatures reaching 39 (103) degrees!!  Thankfully hotel had excellent air conditioning.  Used the hop on/hop off bus (easy walk) to get to the East Side Gallery and the train (access very close to hotel) for Charlottenburg Palace and the Sunday Flea Market.  Rooms very clean and bed comfortable.  Staff very helpful and spoke excellent English.  Breakfast very good.  Didn't eat or drink there in the evening as restaurant and bar very expensive.,5
6957,"So, let me start by saying that all the staff, every single one we met, were amazing, from the concierge to the pool people.  It's such a shame that the management clearly don't have a grip on the hotel's problems.  So here they are:  We arrived around 3pm, we signed in to a piece of paper saying our room wouldn't be ready until 3, no problem, except we were told it wouldn't be ready until 4. Hmmmm.  So we got in the room, nice scented candle burning, we also noticed that there was a plug-in room freshener in the corner of the room.  We went out for a bit, the maid turned down the room and turned the air on on high.    Then we went to bed and noticed the smell.  In the morning it was obvious, the room had a damp problem.  We were on the first floor at the front.  The room next…",2
6958,"I stayed there 3 nights and really enjoyed it. Great location near bastille and walking distance from bars, restaurants,... Rooms are big and new 😍 I enjoyed the gym for daily workout and a super nice breakfast.buffet (real orange juice, amazing madeleine...everything tasty!) I will definetly come back to this hotel. I recommend it definitely.",5
6959,"Stayed for 4 nights during a business trip, fantastic location, great breakfast and selection, very clean rooms.  Although the night time reception staff seemed very rude and unhelpful when I had some requests, all catering staff were excellent along with the super efficient bar tenders who was polite and very helpful and want to ensure mine and other peoples time at the bar was comfortable and enjoyable.  I would recommend this hotel for a business trip and would stay here again. ",4
6960,"The hotel is nice and the room was fine. Staff was pleasant and helpful. Breakfast was very rich with excellent pastries and good coffee and juices. The only down side was the distance from the center, actually about 15 minutes drive from Alexander platz but good excess to mass transportation.",4
6961,"Good price so no frills expected, but come on, not even a hand towel for free? And the light in the bathroom turning off automatically after one minute forcing you to jump and wave while sitting on the toilet? Location is great but this hotel is mostly for 18-25 year old.",3
6962,"Very nice hotel in the center of Paris, very nice room, very clean, very comfortable bed, smiling staff, reactive and professional, I will return with pleasure. The hammam a good gift. A true Eden in the heart of Paris.",5
6963,"This little hotel is around the corner from the Eiffel Tower and across the street from the Bir Hakeim metro stop and the Champs de Mars train station. From these two stations, you can go anywhere! There are 2 great cafes right by it and a pharmacy close by. The rooms are small, but very clean, have a safe in the closet, hairdryer in the bathroom, and great AC and many TV channels. The front desk is 24 hours, so it is very convenient. The breakfast is a bit pricey, but you can just go to a cafe next door. They even have a resident cat that lives in the lobby. The kids loved it. We would definitely stay here again!",5
6964,"The location of this hotel is on a quieter canal.  Walking distance to center of Amsterdam and the surrounding neighborhoods.  The room that we stayed in was very small.  Not much space to put our things.  The bathroom could only accommodate one person at a time.  Although cramped (or cozy of you prefer! ), it was clean.  The bed was comfortable and the shower worked well. There were stairs from the ground level to the first floor of rooms,  then another 2 sets of narrow and winding stairs to our room.  Not the easiest to navigate, especially with luggage. Check in is in the bar. Basic continental breakfast was also served in the bar. ",3
6965,I usually don't bother but people need to know this place is overrated and over priced. My bill was inaccurate the entire stay.  Save yourself the trouble and stay elsewhere. I'll never stay here again.,1
6966,"Good rooms for the price, great bathroom and amenities. Lovely Pool. Staff are generally very friendly and accommodating.  Breakfast could do with some serious improvement as does not meet current standards of other hotels in Greece, particularly as it is at an extra cost! We had a room with a balcony which was nice to sit out on in the morning. However, the hotel is a 10-15min walk from the centre of Fira. However, this walk is along roads with no pedestrian sidewalks and lots of cars, 4-wheelers and scooters whizzing past at high speeds. Very dangerous to say the least!! Although it was value for money, i would probably pay the extra money and stay in the centre of Fira on my next visit. The walk is not enjoyable at all, especially in the summer months!",3
6967,"Positives   Made to feel very welcome  Professional courteous staff Clean spacious rooms  Location is perfect for port, la rambla, gothic quarter, playa catalunya all a few mins walking distance  Good value for money  Negatives   Can get very noisy at night until the early hours ",4
6968,Room was clean  and comfortable. The concierge was very helpful and kind. Suggested a Hop on Hop  off tour  and even printed the discounted ticket for us. Located in walking distance to the #3 stop on the tour route which was great! We ubered to the hotel from the airport and back no prodlems. ,5
6969,"In 15th arrondissement, within short walk to metro, shops, any amount of restaurants. Very convenient quiet location.  Staff very helpful.  We had a room on the ground floor with great (disabled) facilities.  Lots of hot water big wet room.  Would stay again in a heart beat.!!",5
6970,"Spent few days during a conference that took place in the hotel. Very convenient facility.  excellent for hosting conferences. Very rich breakfast. Located well for going out in the evenings and for sightseeing.   Pool is OK, SPA service is expensive.",4
6971,"Disorganized front desk and management that doesn't really seem to care.  Room wasn't made, causing great inconvenience waiting for a maid when I would have preferred going to bed.  Hard to find for someone unfamiliar with the City, and very rough neighborhood.  Previous stay included lox and other delicacies, but they suddenly stripped breakfast buffet to what you might find in a Holiday Inn Express.  Nobody could explain why the breakfast buffet had been decimated.",1
6972,"A wonderful place in the citycenter of Cannes, just few meters from the central train station. It is very silent and calmful, though it is situated in the middle of the city.   The staff is very attentive and helpful. The room was in a perfect condition, maybe a little bit small, we missed place to store our luggage properly. Everything was clean and fresh.   They have a really great service on their lounge on the top floor, where you can beverages (water, juice, sodas etc) for free 24/7 with snacks and fruits, and on the evening there are also a free buffet with cold cuts, sweets and one glass of wine, all for free. The only disadvantage with this is that the service starts at 7 p.m, and that is a bit late, when you however wants to go out for dinner. But it is a great service!…",5
6973,"To management of Four Seasons:  I would suggest that you take your entire staff down a couple of blocks for a stay at The Peninsula.  When you walk into The Four Seasons, you wouldn't know that they even had doormen; they were too busy chatting among themselves.  You also wouldn't know you were in the right location since your entrance is not staffed (see Peninsula).  It took FOUR requests to get a mini fridge and microwave - I've seen better quality appliances in dorm rooms.  The mini fridge was missing it's shelves and the wires in the door that hold beverages onto the shelves.  Useless.  The TV service is a joke.  No, I do not visit Chicago to sit and watch TV.  But I do enjoy waking up and watching a bit of TV and relaxing; you literally could not turn from one channel to…",1
6974,"The hotel, the room (224) and the location in the old part of Funchal are all perfect. Breakfast buffet also good. But avoid the dinner buffet - its far below the standad of a ****hotel (a la carte or menu are optional though).  We pre-paid for seven dinner buffets but after the first try we decided to eat our remaining six dinners at local restaurants, and there are a lot of very good one in close proximity of the hotel. .",3
6975,"Can you find a warm hearted place in efficiently cold Berlin? Of course COSMO Hotel Berlin Mitte. Very co-operative and friendly staff. As if I knew them from ages!  The mechanics are well in place as well. Well appointed rooms, amenities that work, impeccable finish in true German tradition.  Go on, you'll not be disappointed! ",5
6976,"Good value, near the beach, but NO DRAWERS in the room. I also underwent an embarrassing and sexist check in experience where I, a woman, had booked a room for myself and my male companion. When I arrived, the hotel had changed the name of the reservation to my companion's name and would not allow me to check in since I was the woman on the reservation instead of the man. The front desk did not offer any solutions and further continued to address us only by my companion's name for the rest of the trip. I would rather pay a little more next time and be treated as a whole person than be this embarrassed again. ",2
6977,"We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights and I have quite mixed feelings about it. There were some fantastic things about it, but there were other things that I felt let it down. Overall I have stayed in nicer hotels for a similar price.   The excellent things about this hotel - it was very convenient for the old part of Porto, near the cathedral and bridge and just a few minutes from the Sao Bento metro and train stations. The staff were fantastically helpful, attentive and friendly (particularly the concierges) and check in and out went very smoothly. The public areas of the hotel were lovely, and the breakfast buffet was pretty good - we enjoyed sitting next to the window and looking out over the square as we had breakfast. The room was spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated,…",3
6978,Great place. Very big. Good beer in the pub clean. Staff was great.  Decent location. The tube was right around the corner. Eggs are a bit salty at breakfast and bring earplugs to sleep!  All in... would stay again!,4
6979,"Accommodation was clean and of a good standard. What let the experience down was the food in the restaurant; breakfast was ok, but the quality of food for evening dinner (over 2 nights) was pretty poor..... disappointing for a hotel that charges a weekday rate of just under €250 per night....I've given it a ""3"" overall, the food was more like ""2"" at best ....",3
6980,"I didn't expect much based on other reviews. However was even more disappointed upon arrival. There was a dead beetle half smeared on the floor outside the elevator. After a day It was still there. I had to ask them to clean it as an ant trail had started. The rooms are ok but no attention to detail, like gaps between plastering, and no seal in the doors to the balconies, leaving generous gaps for Mosquitos. However the most annoying part of this place is some of the male staff, trying to sell us trips while we're at breakfast in their friends cars to the sand dunes. Thank goodness for trip advisor I knew what he was offering was a huge rip off. Then I asked reception to book a bus for us to nha trang. The male behind the desk said he's friend could drive us, but we said no we…",2
6981,"Large hotel with a helpful staff, most very young and multi-lingual.  Stayed in junior suite overlooking the pool, which was magnificent.  The room was very clean and large, but with a limited amount of furniture.  Our main seating area was very dark.  The bedroom was acceptable, and the bathroom was clean, but did not provide a hand bar for climbing over and into the shower, and the glass partition only covered half of the shower area so water inevitably got on the floor.  We did enjoy our stay there as the hotel is a 20 min. very safe walk to town.  We did not eat at the restaurant as there were large lines from minltiple bus tours, as the hotel caters to them.  We will probably not stay there again.",3
6982,NEVER going to stay in any Conrad franchise ever again. Called the hotel regarding some urgent issue and have to modify the reservation. The operator could not solve my issue but the manager was not willing to have the flexibility to help.,1
6983,"Furnishings and accommodations: Good. Beds are comfortable, rooms are clean. I had a nice view. They are renovating some parts so the hotel can only get better.  Service: so-so. When I checked in it seemed like the front desk person was annoyed. I asked her if she was ok and she said she had had a long day. And usually, they only had one person at front desk even if there was a line. So, this tells me hotel needs to spend more on staff for front desk so they don't get worn out. This same tired employee did greatly help me later on when I had an issue with laundry, her response to me ""I will resolve this issue, don't worry."" That's the type of employee that needs to be fostered.  Location: great area in Parque das nacoes area, but far from center of town.  Overall, a nice average…",3

It contains a restaurant serving breakfast, lunch and dinner as well as a small bar - all reasonably priced. Close by is a food hall serving everything from burgers to sushi, dumplings to poke balls, mezze to tapas, ramen to frozen yogurt. The hotel is almost boutique, very stylish and inviting.  Room We had a room located on first floor. It is sized OK with big comfy bed, Nespresso machine, TV, and a rather spacious bathroom for Amsterdam hotels. It has full A/C as no window can be opened.

The street is quiet and the neighborhood is very pleasant. Hotel staff is very nice and sweet and you can get tram passes and museum tickets at the reception. The only thing is that our room didn’t have air conditioning so although they tried to help us providing a fan we kind of had a hard time to sleep as weather was pretty hot.",3

I wanna say thanks to Mr. Dadashi and all other staffs who are very friendly .hotel is not in the middle of attractive tourist places but  the best thing about this Hotel is the distance to the metro station. it can't be more near than this ! specially when you are tired and it is rainy. breakfast is average and could be better .. rooms are small but very comfy ... will return for sure .",5
6988,"We were shocked by how unmotivated the lady server was at the Atrium restaurant inside the hotel this evening.  It leaves a terrible impression and reflects badly on the entire hotel quality. For a 5 star hotel, this Hyatt Regency failed miserably to train their servers properly.  Terrible attitude and laziness should not be tolerated. The restaurant manager seems to be absent during dinner time.",1
6989,"Great location, nice staff, rooms are descent size but bathrooms are old.  Breakfast is horrible as everything comes from a packet or can, including the canned juices, packet made eggs and canned fruits.  The restaurant in the hotel is very expensive based on the location.  Make sure you put the do not disturb sign on the door or house keeping will come and clean and throw out your stuff at 8 am!!!",1
6990,"The hotel, inside & out was lovely! Quiet location, not far from the main attractions (walkable). The staff was very friendly & helpful, especially on Reception. We was advised of a local really good Indian by the reception staff & we was not disappointed! The rooms was so clean with lots of space, free use of safe & even a handy mini tablet (more like iPhone) in every room for guests to take out & use as a pocket tour guide which is the 1st time I’ve ever come across this! Really good idea! Breakfast wasn’t great but wasn’t bad either, lots of different selection, for breakfast - I couldn’t find one actual teabag though which was disappointing, only tea leaves, didn’t ask as the waitresses didn’t seem to know much English. Would stay here again if I returned to Berlin",4
6991,"I will preface this review by saying that when I regularly stay at the Four Seasons or Relais and Chateaux properties, so paying over $1,600 a night for a room isn't out of the ordinary - however the Ritz Carlton Half Moon Bay needs to be very careful with what they charge their guests as the experience I had at this property certainly might be considered price gauging by some.  And for goodness sakes, if your going to charge customers through the nose for their rooms, the least your front desk staff can do is to be courteous and professional.  For starters, the only thing this property has going for it is the location.  If you are not a golfer, than you should avoid as despite advertising a spa, the Ritz Carlton has done away with a lot of the services at the spa they advertise…",2

Great location (amazing sunset view and much closer to the various other ""must dos"" in Santorini than either Oia or Fira). We had our room upgraded twice (at no cost).  The bad:  Bath robe in first room still had coins in it from previous customer. Stale bread in bread basket (first night room service). Room wasn't at expected level of cleanliness (although I must say that we were upgraded to the best villa in the place and they threw in a comp bottle of wine as well). No complimentary bottles of water. No breakfast buffet (you have to order the night before and the kitchen crew is understaffed so your coffee typically shows up lukewarm) and the croissants are not always as fresh…",3

No extras in the room, in fact it felt like they forgot to put furniture in the room. While using the iron the water would leak out, I only half filled the water.  Décor was average and the price was expensive. Having sent the night prior at the H Hotel at LAX I was very disappointed.   I will not be back.",1

Arrived at Tegel airport and information desk kindly provided directions via 128 bus then U6 underground to Oranienburger Tor stop . Only cost us 9€ for four of us one way which you have to purchase from a machine outside the airport at the bus stop. Luckily an inspector was on hand to help us. When we got there we walked along Friedrich Strasse towards the Friedrichstadt Palast on the opposite side and left up Reinhardt Strasse with the hotel on left of the street. Signage to hotel could have been better. We only found the hotel as we were looking at the street numbers and went in to ask as saw a chap on the reception desk. You have to go through a frontage of four 30 foot pillars and over a small…,4

I drove around twice to find the parking location as its up a gated road and then you need to go through another gate.  The lady at check in was actually rude which is odd since everyone else in Portugal was so nice.  Our room was really tiny, not enough room or 2 people and 2 big suitcases; thankfully it was just one night.  We missed the breakfast since we slept in due to jet lag do not sure how that was.  Again just glad it was for just one night.",3

But let me be fair- it's Amsterdam. Positives first:  Breakfast was very good. They will make you a simple but good cheese platter in the evening and you get a complimentary drink. The staff was very nice. The rest: My room was on the top, 4th floor, which I found out as I was checking in. Considering the horror those stairs were, the hotel needs to discuss the room location ahead of time. If you have any knee issues, you are older or afraid of tight spaces and heights, you will not be able to climb those steps(getting suitcases up there is pretty impossible too- i had a carryon). I also wondered how people would…",3

Yes it has a pool, steam room and various facilities but the whole place feels like it needs an upgrade.

I switched to the Hilton which is nearby and is amazing",2
7000,"Great rooms, clean, comfortable and stylish. This hotel is not in the centre but close to the sea, metro, tram and bus links, therefore it is easy to access other areas of the city from here, however this may not suit everyone. Prior to our visit we had purchase the Barcelona card which gave us access to all public transport for 4 days which made it easy for us get around. Nice outdoor bar terrace and pool. Unable to access executive floor as we were in a standard room. Snack from bar was very good. Unfinished building next to hotel and building site on the other side. Overall worth considering if you want to stay in a nice hotel with reasonable room rates and good transport links that is close to the sea. In my opinion it is a worthwhile option which I would consider again.",4
7001,"The Movenpick is in a great location with respect to public transportation and some popular sites. The building is a blend of new and historic, but the room completely modern. The breakfast buffet is the best we've ever experienced in Germany, and every staff member we encountered from reception, to food services to housekeeping were stellar. Our room, however, would not cool so the man from housekeeping/engineering mercifully provided a floor fan while ""a fix was explored"" for the air-conditioning. No fix was ever found and a substitute room was offered for the final night of our stay, though by then we chose to stay put.",4

Second, I have left my passport at my room. When I arrive airport, I call the housekeeping and give them my room no. They said they didn’t find it. I travel back to hotel from airport, ask for help from the reception, they said already contact the house keeping. And refuse to let me check in again at first even I have already paid the room fee early check out for my 22:50 flight to Hk. When I get back the room, I just find my passport is on my desk and when I get back to airport, the flight has gone and need rebooking.

Having stayed in Doubletree hotels before and being Hilton Honors members, we were enthusiastically attracted to the Gates Hotel.   It offered a very reasonable nightly rate, a reasonable daily resort fee (that included internet, chairs and beach towels) and a location within walking distance of many South Beach features including Lincoln Road and, of course, the beach.  We should have focused our research on the negative reviews and not the positive reviews.  It really makes you wonder if the positive reviews are truly written by customers and not staff.  Upon arriving near the hotel, we drove around the block three times till we figured out how to find the hotel's…",1

It is right on Rue Cler which has lots of restaurants and shops when you walk out the door and many others within walking distance.  The staff especially Florentin and Idir are incredible!

I would highly recommend staying at Cler Hotel!!!",5

Buy one (two) day pass 7 euro (12 euro/2days) . Hotel is very basic, room small, clean. Rooms screaming to be remodelled . Only one thing I was disappointed was breakfast. Quiet expensive for what they offer. 11.5 euro for cold eggs, burned bacon.  Staff was pleasant . Worth to stay there if you get a wright price.",3

There was no hot water and was told to wait a couple hours for hot water again. When we requested a new room with working heat the staff stated there wasn't one available and promised to have available later. After returning to check on a new room they stated they were booked and couldn't move us. They management was inefficient and not friendly.

Our room was for 3 of us , my husband, son and I but we had to move a bed everyday to be able to open the balcony doors, not a huge issue.  The food was ok but I can say we never had a meal that we thought was very good but then again we never left hungry , we filled a whole.

On a positive note I would say the check in was quick however they wanted to complete the administration in our room which I found rather odd. I said no we could complete at the desk, it was only handing over passports and taking visa details so I don't know why they wanted to do it in the room!  On the first evening we went to their restaurant where we were ignored by staff. It was freezing in the restaurant and me and my husband were both cold but that's a side issue.

The hotel was selected after a recommendation by one of the women in the group (she had never stayed before, simply heard it was THE place to stay in downtown) I did not do a site visit in advance (which I usually do and will always do in the future). Things started off rocky during check in and never really improved. Two of the guest rooms had issues (both gross, so I won't be specific) and the solution for the first guest was to offer drink coupons.

I didn't find the staff welcoming or helpful, apart from the cleaners who were friendly and efficient (maybe they should have the front of house roles). The lobby/bar area appears closed all the time, very dark and unwelcoming. The rooms were basic, no fridge, which is a necessity when no snacks etc are on offer throughout the day at the hotel, rooms were cleaned well daily though. We enjoyed the pool area, a lot of shaded area, which suited myself and my son well, we had the pool to ourselves most of the time! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Lagos, it's lovely.

At $200 a night and only a about a block away from the lake front and museums, I took it. I however did not read the reviews ahead of time, I really wish I had. In the weeks leading up to my trip I did start reading the reviews and started feeling really uneasy and regretful.

Interior design is horrible, bur that's my personal opinion.",2

When I complained to the front desk, they didn't seem to understand the term ""rotting food"" though when I returned to my room in the evening, they had washed the cup that had been filled with rotting food and cigarette buts and placed it on the dresser for me, which I found incredibly bizarre.

Tiny bathroom that was incredibly hot due to a large heated towel rail that could not be adjusted/turned off. Antique hairdryer. Advertised ‘rain shower’ was a basic shower head.

The Ojai Valley Inn & Spa has beautiful grounds and nicely maintained, and spacious accommodations.  However, these are the only things the hotel has going for it.  The hotel is poorly managed and not worth the hefty price tag.  The hotel lost our reservation and failed to honor our bed request, necessitating us to switch rooms.   To make matters worse, our keys to our new room stopped working and it took 2 phone calls and 40 minutes of waiting for any of the staff to let us in our room.

I told the staff at check in that I'm both allergic to cigarette smoke and pregnant but there was nothing to be done, this was the best available (which I believe to be true, which makes it even worse).

Also on our arrival we complained of being allocated a room on the bottom floor, and the receptionist quickly upgraded us to a room on the top floor with a great sea view with splendid sunsets every night, which we much appreciated, so many thanks for that! Beware of the crashing waves at night though if you value your sleep take earplugs with you. Plenty choice of food in dining rooms although we avoided the beef/steak as was always like shoe leather.

I would say, if you want a good tea service, I would recommend going to the Waldorf Astoria or Peace Hotel instead of Shangri-La. Slightly overpriced and the service/food underperform.",2

We got our cocktails that were mostly melted 20 min later.   Rooms were nice and housekeeping was phenomenal. Beds were fine. The breakfast (included) was okay but was the same menu every morning.   The last night of our trip we wanted to go to a restaurant suggested by a family friend.

The room we had on the 5th floor was clean, tidy and had a view over to the cathedral. We didn't eat there so can't comment on the food but the restaurant was busy every night.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Berlin. ",5

The room was very small and had no desk to work at. The staff was friendly and helpful but even that does not make up for the fact that my nights sleep was terrible because how cold the room was. I would not recommend to stay here when outside temperature are below 12C. I believe it could be nice in summer but the owners must fix the heating problems in the building before I would ever consider staying at this hotel again.,3

But if you have a one floor apartment you should be totally fine. Still, I would go back as loved the area!",4

Apparently they schedule a shift change at 2:30, so they asked me to sit in the lobby while they waited for someone to check the room (it’s still not clear to me why someone on the new shift needed to inspect the room before i could go in).  So eventually I get into the room and...well.... you know those hotels that are obvious makeovers of old apartment/condo buildings and the new owners do a half assed job of renovating them?

The one thing that let down the hotel was the food. It had an a la carte restaurant (we were in the buffet one!) and its menu looked good.

But there are no cafés nearby so if you don't want to start your day hungry you just have to add it, and that extra 10€ a day seems quite pricey given what you get for it. Just basically a standard breakfast, they don't even have yoghurt.  Then there's the cold rooms. Our first room was so cold we had to change to another, which was ok by one desk staff, while others didn't want to give us a new room. So the service was depending on who was at the desk. They also told us that the heating went off if you removed your card from the card light switch by the door, which is something I've never heard anywhere…",3
7064,"This is not a typical hotel with a bustling lobby, bar, restaurant, etc. Rather, it is part of an office/shopping complex and access to rooms is separate from the lobby/reception which closes at night. That being said, if you don't need a lot of hand holding, this hotel is GREAT!  Our suite was exceptionally large, tasteful, and comfortable. We had two rooms -- one King bedroom with lots of closet space, and one sitting room/kitchen with a full size refrigerator and space to spread out. This is where they put a comfy rollaway for my teenage son. There is also a foyer, another huge closet and nice bathroom. We loved the space to relax in a well-appointed oasis that almost felt like an apartment without the hassle! A nice breakfast with a view is another perk. The location is…",4
7065,"This was a great location for visiting Berlin and seeing the city. Steps from the buses and blocks from trains and metros. The room itself was nice and clean, and the staff was friendly. Great for single travelers on the budget but who don't want a dorm-style hostel. Supermarket is nearby. My two criticisms would be the noise-- my room was on the first floor and faced the back. With no a/c it was a bit warm so I had the window and patio door open. Even with them closed, the noise from the parking lot at 6 am was unbearable. Second, wifi barely worked and when I asked about it the staff basically told me it works and it must be my device (it was not. I had multiple devices and none could find the wifi). Small gripes, though. Would recommend but suggest requesting a room not…",4
7066,"Relatively small boutique hotel, high quality fittings and furnishings, but rooms quite cramped, not much hanging space for clothes.  The roof-top bar/restaurant was very nice, but the views are not amazing and the service a little unprofessional.  Breakfast was fair but nothing like the choice or quality expected from such an establishment. This applies to both the cooked portions and the pastries. In fact, to everything.   We enjoyed a great time in Lisbon, this hotel is ""ok"" however did not not at all feel up to its five stars rating.",3

7070,"Average hotel in the heart of Lisbon.  Close to two metro stations.  The room was clean but in dire need of refurbishing.  Although we were on the 8th floor we could still hear traffic at night.  Also a problem with the plumbing - it was very loud whenever anyone used the commode.  The pipes would rattle.  Hotel Staff were very helpful and friendly.  The breakfast was not that great.  Watered down juices, etc., however, the view was fantastic.    ",3
7071,"We stayed here for one night, in one of the rooms that is behind the bookcase.  The Hotel is a design hotel and is extremely cool - all of the rooms look amazing and have their own quirky features which is great and we really loved.  However, our room did not have a window and there was no air conditioning in the Hotel (or it was off, which I find hard to believe in July).  As a result the entire hotel is very hot.  The staff are also very trendy but quite slow off the mark and not particularly useful (they are nice people though).  Overall, it was really really cool to stay in for one night, but if you are looking for a conventional hotel, this is not for you.",3
7072,Having read some recent reviews I agree with most of them.  We had a studio with fantastic balcony with sun loungers table a chairs which was indeed a bonus and gave a lot of privacy.  Kitchen facilities are adequate but location of power points in that area needs looking at as had to boil kettle in cupboard as no power points in kitchen area whatsoever.  Cannot complain whatsoever about cleanliness and maid service - quick and unobtrusive.  I do however have to agree with another reviewer’s comments about it feeling more like a conference or service hotel - definitely lacked any ambience in the evenings. I also have to agree unfortunately about the reaction of the reception staff when the fire alarm went off and we dutifully followed fire evacuation procedures as it stopped and started several times.  Our concern seemed a bit inconsequential to them and they dismissed it as ‘oh the maid pressed the wrong button’ .  We didn’t see any other member of staff between us leaving our room and eventually getting to reception even though we told the we saw atowel had been placed at one of the fire doors. On arrival and departure staff were very friendly however.  Good central location nevertheless.…,3

Once in our rooms, we felt very relaxed due to the spacious bedroom and bathroom and the cleanliness of the rooms.  The following evening we decided to eat in the hotel restaurant due to the horrible rain outside. We arrived at the restaurant and asked for a table of 5. Initially the waiter told us, as a group of 5, we couldn’t be seated together.  We then asked if they could put us together – which after some persuasion, the waiter agreed.

We had paid for a room with a view but when we had got there our room was flooding so we were given a standard room, nothing was mentioned about refunding us what we had paid extra and no apology. We overlooked this and made the most of our time there. Bus Shuttle times are very limited, your better organizing your own transport. What has made me give this bad review is that a month & half later, we have still not received our deposit back after a number of attempts with no reply from the motel.

BUT: Mr.Kostas; the hotel manager; is not at all the nice and helpful man you'd expect to meet based on reading previous reviews . Also, ""Mama's cooking"" is very average and the restaurant menu is very limited. The worst thing about this hotel for us was that they charged us EUR 15 per NIGHT (!!) for a baby cot.

Good location, with a subway station at the end of the street. The Topography of terror museum is one street over, and Checkpoint Charlie within a 10 minute walk.  No iron, kettle, safe or hair dryer in room (one can be borrowed from reception for returnable €20 deposit).  Didnt have breakfast (There i a Lidl supermarket around the corner), but there are vending machines in the reception. Decent hotel, perfect for those on tight budget. Was clean, and the reception staff were friendly. Might opt for the normal Ibis next door next time. ",4

They were careful to go over the property, its features, and how to get a ride on the bus into local Thira. We are platinum SPG, and as such were upgraded to a suite with a jacuzzi and was given free breakfast. After having come from other SPG properties in Greece, it was nice to see that they honoured these perks (however read on for why other SPG allowances were not provided). The suite was a great size, offering different rooms and a real Grecian feel. The hotel is away from the madness of Santorini so if you're looking for something away from it all, this is your place.

Near the city centre and with 2 excellent places for breakfast in 1-2 minutes of walking distance it felt convenient. Nevertheless, the room itself has a few drawbacks. There is no opening window, so there was accumulation of moisture every day we woke up. The room is not cleaned unless you pay for such a service, but it is delivered clean, so if you stay for a little while it is bearable. The bathroom is isolated from the room only by a fogged glass, which may feel weird. It is a value for money hotel, but if you prefer good amenities it is better to chose something else more expensive. This hotel is only for a short stay and for travellers who…",3

My room was tiny so tiny, that they had to remove the door from the bathroom and shorten the bed a little bit. If you are 1,90 or taller you won't fit.

The bathroom was huge and immaculate.   We will definitely be returning to Berlin and would definitely look at staying here over any other hotel.",5

The problem that we found were the concierge and the lobby staff. We got scam twice when we asked them to get a taxi for us. They used the same technique twice: Apparently they call a taxi, the taxi cancels at the last minute and they offer you a ""private"" car who does not offfer receipts and charge you 100% more for the ride. If you are in a hurry you end up saying yes, like we did. Another guest told us that the same happened to them. Really sad and incredible that this situation happens in this hotel.

The two women in white shirts sitting at the reception desk barely acknowledged us sweating like pigs with our suit cases in hand.  When they did, they asked us to take a seat and had welcome drink organised. After a few minutes a different lady in white returned to the desk and assisted us with luggage.

We got there at 11 and were welcomed by the owner and given a key to the room and brief explanation of the underground system and where the sights are.  The room was quiet, comfortable, big enough.  Shower was fine.  Breakfast was basic continental breakfast - museli, cornflakes,cold meats and cheeses etc.  Clearly not a luxury hotel, but is fine for a weekend base in Berlin.",4

7099,I've stayed at this hotel twice before.  I wouldn't disagree with the good comments on the cleanliness of the hotel and the standard of food and beverages. I returned from Lagos last night and while I didn't stay at the hotel this time my partner and I were concerned at the  cleanliness of the swimming pool which we did use.  I had to remove litter from the pool several times (ice cream wrappers) and the water didn't appear very clear to me.    I'm writing this because  I have been up all night with my son who has a dreadful ear infection and the only place he swam was in this pool.  It's not the first time.   I would encourage parents to get their children to wear ear plugs before using this pool because flying only exacerbates 'swimmers ear' (i.e. infection of the inner ear).,3

Don't choose Ritz if you are allergic tothe  old school style or to fitted carpets (I am!). The location though is fairly good, 25-30 minute walk to the absolute center.

The bar was lively and it was easy to interact with other people - especially out front. The only thing I would recommend would be paying attention to the luggage room storage if you check in / out early.

Very dirty carpet in the room, which make everything else feels dirty. The room size is very small. The only fridge is a mini bar and not usable. No microwave.  The services are worse than the room. 2 front desk staff were checking in 30 guests. It was a 30 minutes wait while a few more staff were working on something else or chatting but not coming to help.  No enough towels in the room. It took 2 calls and 1.5 hours wait to get them!  There is no lounge for Hhonor members. Cheese pizza for room service costed more than $37. Breakfast selection is small and staff are not helpful. Shuttle bus driver hates his…",1
7123,"A week here proved to be a great find. Décor was a bit quirky but the exec room was spacious and quiet. Not impressed by the one evening meal  we had where service was poor and a bit off-hand. BUT the breakfast was excellent!   The reception staff were particularly friendly and helpful.  This is close to the river, Berlin Museum and site for the old barges with laid back river/ canal side bars/ cafes. The local restaurants are OK and if you are prepared to go a little up market very good. Two U-Bahn stations are close-by and the 147 bus is very regular taking you right into town in 10 to 12 minutes. A weekly pass around 30 euros covering all transport is a bargain.",4
7124,"We stayed here the weekend of 26Jan.  Location is awesome right in La Rambla!  Front Desk, bell person is helpful!  Housekeeping does a great job!  Room is clean.  The only thing is the air conditioning is not really working , we had to open the window to keep the room cold and the washroom tile is old, and not as clean. Overall, we had a great stay!",4

They did not have any face towels after the first night. They told us that the towel were being laundered. However by night three they still didn’t have any towels. We had to go to Walgreens and purchase our own towels. Save your money and spend it somewhere else!,1

The location of the hotel I thought was pretty good as we were there to see Amsterdam everything was 20-30 minutes walk and that was always a good way to start the day by seeing some of the town. We never ate at the hotel.   Would recommend going to see the Heineken experience which is a 10 minute walk from the hotel   Would recommend this hotel ",3
7130,"I haven't stayed in hostels much most recently but after experiencing a few hostels in a row in the course of my trip I can definitely say that this was the best one so far and it boils down to it being independent - while it can be still managed professionally in terms of cleaning, maintenance etc. the service is much more personal - the staff went out of their way to accommodate my various requests and I immediately felt the difference when a similar request was brushed off by the front staff in a bigger hostel elsewhere. I also liked that it had 'free stuff' where I deposited smth I didn't need at the end of my stay and picked up respectively smth I needed - appreciate not wasting things! I should also say that the area is amazing - honestly, I didn't feel a need to leave it…",4

Our check-in was at 4pm we didn't check-in until 720pm that night. My debit card kept being charged and the manager at the desk beside Cindy were rude and disrespect.

I went to sleep thinking that the heater will be fixed but woke up at 12:30am freezing. Thankfully another staff on duty helped me move to a new room and gave me extra blanket. It was -2 to -5 degrees outside and it was no fun changing room at 1 am. The heater at the new room was working but will shut down for no reason after few hours.

I explained that it had changed and just wanted to book directly (which I always do), I was told 'We don't book direct, you have to go online'..  Since I was getting nowhere fast with this, I switched topics and asked about the parking, as TA comments had mentioned it was limited.

We were originally staying in a ‘Superior Room’ which first off is a lie. The ‘Superior Room’ is the lowest type of room you can get so what is it actually superior too ? When we first went in the room, it was too dark to actually see anything, so we turned on all the lights which did nothing. We opened the balcony window expecting a pool view or some trees but no just someone else’s front door. We were given the option to upgrade our accommodation and benefits for 60 USD or 45 GBP a night.

Although my room was large, the furniture was cheap and the bedspreads were awful polyester.  One thing that drove me crazy was that there was no electrical outlet at the desk asidefrom  the one for the desk lamp.  I was able to stretch my PC power cable across the floor to the nearest other outlet about 8 feet away.  Also, the wifi, which costs R$13.90 per hour, only worked in my bathromm not anywehre else in my room.

The room was adequate, however we noted that the carpet in the corridor didn’t look particularly clean. Shower was quite small & my wife & I are not big at all but if you were on the larger side it really would be tight having a shower. Some of the staff also were not very pleasant to deal with. The breakfast was fair only & I agree with previous reviewers in that when something ran out, it was not replaced. I noted that the box of tea had run out & although the staff member was quite apologetic there was none to be found in the hotel that day or the next day.  The position though is excellent, near…",3

The main two reasons are the fact the internet is faster on my mobile than in the room, to open my email takes 10 minutes, and this has been like this for a while already but I've never cared. The second reason for the bad review is the fact once you leave the Hotel they will not care about you at all.

The employees were wonderful, helpful beyond expectations, fun, and seemed genuinely happy for us that we were having such a good trip.  So many luxury hotels nickel and dime you to death these days - so it's a welcome relief to find the opposite is true in this stylish, well-appointed hotel.

We had to climb two twisting dangerous staircases to get to our room 232. It was awful carrying a large loaded suitcase.  No elevator. the room was very small, but adeqate for 1 night, but the shower room had a shower stall which the base stuck out in the way of getting to the toilet so I arose in the night so I stabbed my toe on it. Best to wear shoes is my tip.  I also went to have a shower and the smooth tiles were so slippery once wet, that I came straight out. Far too dangerous for me.  The bed was comfy and the room was quiet. We opened the windows, but they opened outwards, so no way to stop them…",3

This is the first hotel that we've stayed in that was unable to offer early check in but there is a lovely Italian restaurant where we enjoyed a long lunch before being able to settle in. Our room was spotless with a lovely soft bed. Room and bathroom is modern with the usual facilities. Our only annoyance was the constant noise from pipes and from VERY HAPPY neighbours above... (which, the latter, of course is no fault of the hotel.) Breakfast was superb with a great choice of both hot and cold selections. Hotel is a bit far out but the metro is very close to the hotel, we also walked to the East Side Gallery within 20 minutes however we did stop and read bits of history along the way.",4

Eventually a room was suddenly available but this took more pushing than acceptable to get what I booked.   The twin room was fine, but not worth the price. The King room was odd. It opened into a small room with a desk that was too tight to negotiate your way through comfortably. The main bedroom was again basic and ok, nothing special for the price.

As soon as I saw it I asked for a room on a higher floor and quieter.  I was offered one on the 1st floor... even worst.  Next day I had to be firm and deal with the tour guide (since I was not the directly paying client, the hotel clearly didn't care to hear from me) and insist that if I don't get a room where I can sleep I am moving out.

I would have moved into another hotel if I had not pre-paid for this one. I won't be back and may decide to give my business to another chain.

Staff are loud and not very considerate.  Elevators take forever due to construction workers and staff utilizing them all the time.  I realize they also need the elevators, but they will not even wait for patrons hitting the elevator close button in your face.  Several times, they pushed in front of my girlfriend to get in first.  We were only given one towel each, no face cloth or hand towel, even though the hallway outside our room was lined with towels every morning.

We called housekeeping again and they quickly came in and cleaned the tables. The workers were friendly and accommodating to these issues, we were just disappointed that we payed over $500 per night (for the cheapest room) for a hotel room that wasn’t clean. You could see that certain parts of the room had…",2

7183,"Wonderful staff and a lovely themed hotel with cozy rooms.  Awesome neighborhood with lots of restaurants, cafes, and bars nearby.  The metro station and Sacre Coeur are not far away at all.  Would stay here again, but might opt for a larger room next time.  Cannot speak highly enough about the staff!",5

7185,"Thank you for a comfortable and nice stay. We always choose this hotel during MIPIM exhibition, so it is perfect for business people to stay in. It is located a bit far from Croisette and Palais de Festivals, but who doesn't want to walk down the charming streets of Cannes? I was pleased with the service, nice breakfasts and tasty croissants. It is always clean and comfortable.",5
7186,Nice safe area but a long way away from main attractions. About 20 minute walk to Maglev station. Due to the hard floors every move from your upstairs neighbour can be heard.  Food from room service was bland. Good shower. Were able to accommodate my early check-in without problems or charge.,2
7187,"The room is fine. However, I requested an early check in upon arrival. We were told there wasn't one available and that our room would be ready at 3pm and they would call my cell if it became available sooner. No one called. Arrived back at 3:30 (after walking the city with travel weary children) and our room was NOT ready. I was upset to say the least because I booked this a long time ago and I booked the river view suite and payed $$$$ for it and now am looking at half of a river and a parking garage but ""it's the same view "".  Our luggage took forever to arrive and I had to call down to check on it. It's the first day.  My husband is very upset about the amount of money we are spending because we are not getting what we paid for. We have two more days to go. Hopefully things…",1
7188,I love this hotel I really really love it.  Perfect location- Pyramides Metro nearby and so is many other Paris greats within walking distance.  The room was beautiful and bed was super comfy.   The amenities were great and superb customer service.   On my last night I asked for a wake up call and a 5 am taxi and the cab came in 2 minutes. Prior to arriving I had go a lot of helpful information from the hotel on how to get there.  Plenty of cute shops and cafés nearby. If you want to go on a tour that is close as well. ATMs close also. This is such a nice area in Paris.  It was also a nice touch to leave a complimentary bottle of wine in my room and bring luggage up as well.  I know they have breakfast buffet in the am but I went out to eat. My last night I ate at the adjoining…,5

The food was good, but the coffee I ordered was straight up disgusting. When the waitress arrived about 20% was spilled on the saucer, so she served the fully spilled cup on a napkin. The coffee was covered with a greasy film and milk skin, and looked like it was made 3 hours ago. I don't get how anyone would serve this to a guest.",2

However, there were multiple beer bottles on an outdoor restaurant table the night of Dec 30th and they were still there when we checked out on January 1st. This made me question the cleanliness standards.  Service was hit or miss. Yasmin was nice, but short with responses and didn't go above and beyond. We were assisted by her the most. 2 other front desk staff were great. Didn't catch their names, though. One was a tall gentleman with dark hair. He checked us out on Jan 1st, and was very nice and helpful. We saw him a couple times doing an excellent job. The other lady who helped us was tall and had blonde hair.

There was no staff anywhere in sight outside at the bell stand or anywhere in front of or at the hotel entrance. Once the incident occurred, although staff inside the hotel were alerted to it when a bystander ran inside to say what had happened, no staff came outside to check on what had happened, see if we needed help or to see if we were hurt in any way.   The staff would not dial 911 or call the police.

7199,"Sir Savigny is a very solid choice while visiting Berlin. It is located right next to the Savigny Platz S Bahn station, and an easy 3 stop ride away from Berlin HBF (central).   The hotel has its own burger bar which also serves drinks. It is open until 1AM for your late night cravings.   The room itself is compact but well designed. We had two twin beds that were conjoined into a queen size bed, no problem. I've also enjoyed the Nespresso pod machine in room for coffee. They use small pods and I fortunately brought some for my trip.  All in all good hotel, friendly staff, good food, good location. ",5

Breakfast plentiful if boring same thing every day. Not always very hot either. Evening meal plentiful and varied although again both good not always very hot. Choice if beer,wine or soft drink offered with your meal. Don't stay here if you are looking for night life. Nothing much going on in the hotel or area. We told our agent we wanted to be near the beach, again don't stay if you can't walk down very steep hills around 10-15 minutes then a cable car ride. Walk back takes a good 20-30 minutes as hills are very steep.",3

These guys are thieves. All the customers here say that a safe vault should be there in all the rooms - but no, if there were vaults, then how will they steal money?  You charge a $250 for every night and then do this to your guests? Shame on you.",1

Staff weren't very friendly, no information provided on check in about breakfast, hotel facilities etc, so don't expect too much if you are a tourist visiting.   Breakfast had a lot of choice, but for hotel of this size I expected more choice in terms of cooked breakfast.  No tea making facility in room, only coffee machine, which you had to pay for. No proper mirror apart from in bathroom, which you couldn't use as poor ventilation meant it steamed up from shower. Bed also VERY hard... we had to ask for a topper as it was that uncomfortable.

We used our RCI ""reservation request"" to land this accomodation and got it for a week for just the registration fee of $239.  Outstanding accomodations in a great location for such a low price. Took in the city for several days and also rented a car and drove the coast north & south (just an hour or so each way).  Beautiful area; had a wonderful time!",1
7212,"We spent a week with you and what a great week it was! Location was perfect and staff very lovely. I'm glad that I didn't book breakfast for every morning, for it was good but not great. And pretty expensive. The terrace was really good, but there should be more those sunbeds and less tables and chairs. I don't know how often you clean that pool, but it was quite full of dead skin so we didn't use that on our last days. But overall very clean hotel and I would recommend it to everybody who are thinking about going to Barcelona. ❤",4
7213,"What a huge disappointment our stay at Daisy Resort turned out to be. The reason we chose this place was based solely on it's peaceful location, the swimming pool with it's panoramic views of the sea in the far distance and of course last but not least the glowing reviews. In light of this we arrived at Daisy Resort with such high expectations, instead and to our utter dismay we were met with disappointment after disappointment.  Upon arrival we were greeted by a notice at the swimming pool saying 'No Swimming' this was not surprising given the water in the pool was the colour and consistency of pea soup. We were then informed by management that the swimming pool was out of action due to the fact they were waiting for appropriate cleaning chemicals being delivered from Ho Chi…",2

Walking distance to to Notre Dame (although unfortunately the fire occurred just 1 day before we arrived). Also walking distance to many eateries, shops, bakery etc.   We were a family of 4 including 2 senior citizens. So I was worried of getting higher floors as my parents could not climb up too many floors via staircase. However, upon contacting the hotel upfront, they agreed to give a room on lower floors to accommodate my parents !   The pictures on the website could not do justice as the rooms look way better in real life ! Was surprised as I actually expected a simpler room. Every room has a sink with mirror in the room…",5

Prior to arriving to the hotel an e-mail was sent out to us inquiring if there was anything the hotel could help is with, this attention to detail goes way and beyond any hotel experience we've ever had in the past. Location in Paris is superb, with big malls and many of the ""must see's"" within walking distance and concierges are very helpful and welcoming upon arivval. Cleaning is at a very high standard. The comfort studio we had was very spacious, calm and quiet, even the bed was at the very high end of comfort.

7219,Pros: 1. Amazing amazing location 2. Very friendly and helpful staff 3. Free champagne and chocolates in the room  4. Each night you get a free glass of wine and sushi downstairs  5. Fairly clean   Cons: 1. Very tiny room- the roof slanted very awkwardly and my husband banged his head on it many times (room 502) see attached pictures 2. Bathroom floors were old plastic tiles that needed upgrading  3. Lighting is bad- felt like I was getting ready in the dark!,3

Our Villas were not proper cleaned. Ordering food was a huge struggle and the menu was indeed very poor of choices. We first visit this resort in 2014 and decided to come back as the ocean front view is amazing, sadly this time things did not go smooth, the services quality has decreased. With so much offer around Danang, I would not recommend this resort. Has a great potential.",2

(e.g. Grand Hyatt Seoul) The hotel Champs Elysees Plaza was a great place to stay for 6 days in Paris.    The hotel is a boutique Paris hotel with tons of character and great people working there.  The service is outstanding.  The front desk was always pleasant and willing to give us a hand.

We used Southwest Rapid Rewards points to book (this comes into play in a minute).  When we arrived, there was a HUGE line.  We waited in a tiny hallway (about two feet) due to construction - clapboard and exposed lighting everywhere.  It was so bad, I contacted southwest that day to explain about the construction as it was NOWHERE on the hotel's website.  The room was clean, so we stayed since we had to get to the game.

In my time there I met some very friendly members of staff who were a joy to talk to.   However, on checking out of the hotel me and my room mate were told we had a mini bar bell to pay (there was a large mini bar in each of the rooms), this came as a great surprise as we had not used the mini bar the whole time, in fact we had spent most of our time outside the hotel touring riga. The bill we were told amounted to 30 lats and it included an outrageous variety of alcohlic drinks and even chocolate. The receptionist insisted that there was no mix up and demanded payment.

The hotel also has bicycles for daily rental too.   The hotel rooms were clean, comfortable and quiet although some may find it to be a little bit too dimly lit. Roof top bar looked great but it was too cold at night when we were there so didn't give it a try. What we really appreciated was that all the staff were very friendly and extremely helpful.",4

The rooms are spacious and in very good repair - nice touch are the sweet greetings and complimentary water offered on check in. The only downfall this time was the arrival - no doormen, nobody to greet and and on departure a similar situation where the colleauges for this area stood inside the lobby and have been busy talking rather than offering assistance with my luggage.

Despite August you do not feel cramped  Negatives - dinner buffet was really basic and with limited selection.

The garden has been neglected for quite some time. There was fruit lying around everywhere and some rotten wood pallets in the grass were also abandoned to their fate. The fact that there were 6 cats and 2 dogs made the place feel rather unhygienic. We did not dare to walk on the grass in fear of stepping into any of the animals’ droppings.

7248,"First the positive: The property is beautiful as most Four Seasons are.  I have never been disappointed in the Four Seasons brand while actually staying on the property.  The staff are courteous, and the rooms are gorgeous.  I had a meeting there, and the meeting facilities and food were nice.  The bar has a great atmosphere.  Now the Negative: The meeting had a special rate that required one to call rather than reserve the room online.  That's when human error took over.  While the reservation was repeated back correctly as arriving Monday and leaving Wednesday, the actual reservation was made for Tuesday and leaving Thursday.  Plus, the person wrote down my email as "".com"" instead of "".org""  So I never received a written confirmation.  Shame on me for not realizing I didn't…",1

Close to shopping center, nice small bar, close to the metro we took some trips from there with guide named Guy speaks hebrew was really kind person showed us a lot nice places in Berlin.  And good price. We stayed 5 nights. Nice and clean rooms. Stuff was friendly and helpful. There is a supermarket 2 minutes from hotel. We rented bicycle until victory gate Brandenburger Tor it was beautiful . Really liked everything. I will back for sure.",4
7250,"I chose this hotel for my travel to Sloterdijk, Amsterdam. However, according to references it thought it is better. I was shocked that I was offered with a room with external bathroom (despite private) for 120€/night.. But the staff was really helpful and found another room with a private one without any extra charge. The breakfast was OK, rather said continental +. Wi- Fi worked also quite good. Nevertheless, this hotel is fine for tourists as is really close to the trainstation from where it takes only 5 min by train to the very city centre.",3
7251,"We went out for a whole day site seeing, back to the hotel around 8 pm in the afternoon. We were shocked that the room door is open wide, everyone could see our stuff or come into the room. We had the hotel manager came over, he said that we didn't close the door properly which we are not agree with him, since we always make sure the door is locked. We checked around the room with him, the dirty towels and bath's accessories are gone but the clean ones are not yet provided... It was a scary moment during our trip.",3

After checking into our room we sat for a minute to take in our surroundings. The room had a very distinct musty wet carpet type smell, the walls and curtains were dirty. We went and explained to reception that we were not happy with the room and they were very apologetic and offered to show us a different room. On viewing the 2nd room (which had all the same issues as the first) we decided to check out and find somewhere else to stay.  Management need to update there online photo's to reflect the true condition of this hotel.  Special mention to the front desk staff who were very apologetic and helpful and even offered to find us a new hotel.…",2

Bathroom good size shower only. Tea and separate coffee facilities available. Small gym with all you need. Clean saunas fresh apples, water and plenty of towels available. Key card system for lift, door and credit card swipe (no payment required) for safe all offered good security.  From reading other reviews this room is worth the extra money for noise.

Awful!!",2

A nice touch were the multiple trash cans in the room, with dividers for whatever you're putting in there for recycling purposes.  The staff are also incredibly friendly and helpful. As a group of 11 guys, we were probably a little loud and raucous, but they were happy to chat with a great sense of humour, which was much appreciated. The pool area is also fantastic, located on the roof. Whilst there is some seating, it does get crowded as I believe the pool is open to members of the public, making it sometimes difficult to find somewhere to sit. This is only a minor gripe though and the pool and jacuzzi are…",4
7256,"The hotel was average at best. It is a 1 mile walk uphill from the tourist area. A little bit shady of a walk but nothing specific to share.  We just walked fast and stayed together.   Not really around food places so you have to walk to the tourist area or further uphill where there are a few restaurants.   They ask that you leave the key with them so you have to go to registration every time you want to leave. They didn't seem overtly friendly or helpful but weren't rude.  Breakfast is included. Small selection of cut fruit, hard boiled eggs, bacon, bread and some pastries. Ok to fill you up but not delicious.  There is a fee if you take food out of the breakfast room.  The room is bigger than some of the other European hotels I have been  in but still not huge which was fine.…",3

(I guess that should be their selling point in Amsterdam).  Room is clean, bathroom small. Food is okay, not just breakfast options but  real restaurant with enough options to please everybody.   Staff is friendly and makes the experience a little bit better. But all in all, the hotel itself (building and decor) can not be rated higher than average, especially when you see how much it costs.",3

There were no smile or greeting and she seemed very displeased and grumpy to know we had done an online checked-in through Marriott apps. When we got into our room we were very disappointed to find our ""concierge"" room was less than stellar.   Our bathtub was dirty and the tile appeared dingy. The ceiling had the most unnerving cracks  just inches from the windows, running parallel the length of the room. The television was hanging crooked, and the wall art had smudges and unknown liquid stains.    Even the hallways (14th floor) were dimly lit, giving an unsafe feeling. The elevators also felt very cheap and rickety, as if they were neither inspected nor up to code.      We love autograph collection hotels from Marriott,…",1

The Pestana Palms is well situated on a cliff-top about a 25 minute walk from Funchal centre. We had booked a studio apartment because that was all that was available. The apartment was basically a hotel room with a fridge, sink, 2-ring electric hob and a microwave added. On the upside there was a superb sea view, albeit slightly overlooked by neighbouring apartments on the concave curve of the building, but we were particularly surprised by the relatively poor quality of the furnishings and equipment compared to our Loch Rannoch lodge.

Apart of that the hotel is nice and modern, rooms are clean, staff very friendly and helpful, nothingelse to reproach.",3
7266,"This Sheraton has a nightclub (Club A) on the 3rd floor that goes all night long.  The hotel gave me a room on the top floor and I assumed that I wouldn't hear the music.  However, my window faced the club (facing the large dome) and the bass reverberated all the way up.  The thump, thump, thump was certainly loud enough to keep me awake. At 1AM I finally requested a room change and they placed me in a room on the other side of the hotel. (They ACTUALLY offered to ask the DJ to turn the music down - what a joke!). If you are on an upper floor, facing the large bridge with the wire supports it should be quiet enough.  Otherwise, Club A totally detracts from an otherwise very nice hotel.",2

The neighbouring restaurant d'Chez eux is as french as you can get and they offer a 20%  discount when you stay at the Hotel de France, even though it is a different ownership.   Remember: this is Paris: rooms are smaller than elsewhere in France",5

There were some positive aspects to our stay, but unfortunately they did not outweigh all the negative ones-too many to list.    First, the good: 1. Location/Neighborhood - Hands down, this part of Palermo is where you want to stay. Very cool retail stores, art galleries, design shops and hip restaurants to boot. The neighborhood attracts an interesting mix of creative locals and tourists from all over. 2. Friendly staff 3. Comfortable interiors in the common areas.    Areas for improvement: 1.

From the Amazonian room(lower level, courtyard), there is NO WAY that you will be able to sleep as you hear EVERYTHING that's going on around the hostel. The staff does not regulate the socializing 'after hours'. The bed in the Amazonian room was hard as a rock. The bar/restaurant in front of the hostel is primarily comprised of non-hostel guests. There really is no central area that makes socializing possible. Breakfast is only offered for two hours 7-9am and was not worth getting up for. During my early checkout, the staff did not even offer to compensate. I don't get how people can call this a 'modern' hostel. You can't even put toilet paper down the toilets! I decided to go to an AirBnB for a better night's sleep.…",2

I was left on hold for 5min and then told they couldn’t help me and that they would call me back. Unexceptionable customer service ",1

Wasted 40 minutes approximately to get it repaired. 5. Wash basin tap was dropping again and again. Wasted 1 hour to get it fixed on 2nd day. 6. Bathroom drainage was blocked. Wasted 15 minutes to get it fixed. 7. On 3rd day door lwas not getting locked. Wasted 2 hour to get it fixed including 1 hour waiting time. 8. On 4th day bathroom napkins were not there. Same could not be provided in 24 hours even after approaching the duty in-charge. Tried to approach manager but he was not available. 9. Misguiding Travel Desk or should call shop.,2

7280,Staying here was the straw that broke the camels back. Marriott has really gone downhill over the past couple years. This property needs some serious help with the staff. From the minute we walked onto the property it was attitude after attitude. No one smiling with the exception of Amy at the pool bar she was wonderful but everybody else looks miserable to be working. It's really tough to try and enjoy your vacation when everybody seems like its a real hassle to take an order or get you a drink etc. I normally stay 100 nights a year with Marriott and that just stopped today. No more thinking it will get better as it does not. We stayed in the tower to the left on the 23rd floor and for the entire stay as you exited the elevator it smelled like a stale dirty diaper. We arrived…,2

I also appreciated that the bathroom had a shower cap, comb and toothbrush/ tooth paste available in the suites.  It is close to a lot of restaurants and tourist attractions and shops. It was just a a short stroll to the river or up the street to restaurants and live outdoor performances provided for great entertainment within a short walk.  With taxis directly out front and the metro station a short walk, the hotel was easily accessible.   It is located in an extremely high traffic area with tons of foot traffic from tourists however, so keep that in mind as this can be a bit of pain if you are looking for quiet.",3

Bedrooms appear lovely and fresh but beds were not as comfy as they first seem. Pillows are horrendous. Half of us did not sleep well at all because of this. Our room was not cleaned the whole weekend we only discovered on the Sunday when the housekeeping put a note though the door saying the ""do not disturb"" light was on. Nobody had explained to us when we checked in what this was so we had no idea it was even on.

It wasn’t until the following morning , when he had reception that he was able to call me and reassure me he and his girlfriend had checked in and were safe .

When we arrived at the hotel they would only give us a room with one bed unless we paid another $20 per night. This is the most ridiculous policy ever and a total scam.

The restaurant (Noah) is pricey, with very small portions: I paid US$ 25 for three or four ordinary shrimps and a few spoonfuls of rice. Staff was mostly rude. When I arrived, I had just faced a long flight delay and two hours of traffic, so all I wanted was to go to my room and rest.

In the room, the bathroom had rust stains all over. The room looked like a room out of a horror movie. When I pulled the covers up, bugs were crawling in the bed. Definitely will never stay here.

The pancake ordered for breakfast never arrived after a long wait and the bill requested took a long time to come with no one bothered in taking payment.   That really brings down the supposedly four star hotel status.  ",3

Several problems: - WiFi not working properly in the room. You could tell this was not just a problem of one room considering the number of people sitting in the lounge with their laptops. - Air conditioning was not working the first day. Fortunately it was repaired the second day. - There was a generalized smell of humidity. - There were moths in the cupboard. - There were termite holes in the desk, with fresh wood dust around the holes. - The food was not particularly good either.  I think a chain like Radisson has to do some serious refurbishment. It is not up to the international reputation of the chain.  Sorry! ",2

I didn't realize that booking an expensive room meant getting a dismal breakfast. Without exaggeration, the regency club breakfast selection is 4 ft wide and 8 ft long with a few pastries and fruit.

No where were we notified of an additional fee.

7311,PK hotel Riga is very nice but the service is appalling. I arrived last weekend in the middle of the night after my flight was delayed only to be told that the hotel was experiencing an electrical issue and I would have to go to another hotel. The alternative hotel was already arranged so my friend and I went and were told to call back in the morning to see if we should come back to PK. We called in the morning and were told to come back at 2. Hotel checkout at the hotel we were staying was 11. We only had two days in Riga so we're pretty unimpressed to spend the middle of the day shuffling our things again and paying for taxis to and from new locations.  I understand that electrical issues happen but we were not met worth any apology or sympathy when we finally arrived back at…,2

Nearby area still developing, you might see some construction sites from hotel room. Clientele dominates by business travellers, with few exceptions ( what average tourist will do in eastern part ? ).  Room is large, comfortable and well equiped. As traditionally in Germany hotels - rich and tasty breakfast.  Positive: new, clean and efficient. Negative: nothing specific to mention. Would recommend. If only for tourist purpose - you shall probably choose more central area.",4
7313,"The service at this hotel horrible, their staff here have horrible customer service skills. Nightmare don’t stay at this hotel save your time and money. Stayed here for four nights and didn’t have a room key the whole stay needed a security guard to take us up to our room every time 😡😤",1

7315,"The hotel reception was light breezy but clearly in need of a face lift. Very dated The rooms were studio with kitchen facilities, however the facilities are not turned on, so unless you have a travel kettle and plug you cannot have a drink in your room. Very limited places to eat or things to do, unless you like to sit round the pool! Breakfast is expensive in the hotel for what you get. Up the top of the street a fantastic bakery where they serve lovely coffee and rolls and cakes. We ate there most mornings, great atmosphere too! Bus ride to town , you take your life in the drivers hands  I wont go back just on the lack of facilities and the terrible driving to Funchal, three emergency stops on hair pin bends with terrifying drops down the mountain side!",3

7317,"Stayed for three nights in Dec., 2016. Pros:  Excellent at getting us transportation to the airport.  Allowed me to borrow a phone charger. Owner's son Marcus was kind and helpful always.   Cons: The courtyard is open to the sky and the entire dining area, courtyard, and kitchen were loaded with mosquitos.  The owner insists that you not turn the air conditioning below 24 degrees Celsius and that you turn off the air conditioning entirely every time you leave the room.  He did provide a plug-in mosquito repellent for the room, but when I left for the day, the maid removed it when cleaning the room and did not replace it.  There was a ceiling fan that was on, but returning to a warm room with no mosquito repellant having been in place, meant that my room was full of mosquitos.  The room itself is very minimal - a large bed with two tiny night tables, a small rack with hangers and two shelves over it - no closets or chests of drawers.  The bathroom was large with a shower over tub, toilet, sink, and bidet.  The owner has many rules.  You are not permitted to eat in your room, so I was forced to eat downstairs in the dining room where it was swelteringly hot and loaded with mosquitos.  There is no elevator/lift, and although the owner and his son carried our suitcases up and down for us, it meant a flight of steps in the heat every time I left my room to go out into the city or to  go downstairs to eat, etc.  This may be a good place to stay for a night or two in the winter when the weather is mild, but I would not recommend staying here in the summer months.  I came home very mosquito-bitten despite using a 99% DEET insect repellent on my skin and given the many mosquito-borne illnesses prevalent in Buenos Aires, I wished I had stayed elsewhere.…",2
7318,"Love this hotel! From the minute you walk in you will be happy - cool, understated yet luxurious. So well designed! I just loved it! Staff were friendly and helpful, loved the outdoor patio for drinks or dinner - and get the buffet breakfast in your rate, it was a thoughtful and buffet with lots of extra things you could order.   I travel quite a bit and this rates as one of my favorites! I read from a review that some rooms were small, mine was not, but remember all hotels have some smaller rooms especially in Europe.  Catch the metro from the airport at the Sir Savigny stop is just around the corner. Enjoy!",5

After my first stay, I cancelled my 2nd stay for a variety of reasons. I was traveling with a group  When we all checked in at the same time (well after check in time), some of our rooms were ready while others were not.  My room was one of those that was not ready.  After waiting nearly an hour for a ""clean"" room, I was finally checked in. I found my room to be dirty and old.  The bed was so uncomfortable, that if I tried to sleep in the middle of it, I would just roll to one side or the other.  I never could get comfortable.  The bathroom was dirty and had hair all over it (a big pet peeve for me).  Another issue I had with the bathroom is…",2

Room was not very clean, and area for breakfest is small so we even could not find a free table. And for the first time I have seen one hotel not making omletes in the morning which I really missed. Waiters very slow cleaning the tables in the morning and collecting dirty dishes from tables.",3
7322,Location of Hotel is excellent. But hotel is not in good condition. Room key did not work at least 3 different times. One elevator of two was out of commission for my whole 3 day stay. Not a lot of hot water  Communication was difficult. Had a show cancelled because of miscommunication. Staff is gracious but that doesn't make up for poor hotel. Cannot say it's 4 stars. ,2
7323,"I love Lisbon and have been here several times in the past five years with and without kids staying at different hotels.  From the entrance to the lobby, the check-in staff and up the glass elevators this hotel is a five star. The spa and the buffet breakfast is a plus if included in your reservation.   Unfortunately I was a bit disappointed with my stay at Epic Sana. For a five star hotel I had higher expectations. Having traveled to many European countries and spending time in many hotels the mattress and the furniture in the room did not meet the five star standards.  The furniture in the room was torn and outdated and the mattress was very uncomfortable and wobbly. The steam sauna had a smell of mold and dead skin and I never had that clean spa smell and feeling.  If you are…",3
7324,"So we had a red-eye flight the night before and we barely got any sleep. As is expected my dad got pretty angry when he figured out all 5 of us couldn’t fit in the one suite. We ended up getting two rooms on a corner so to get to each one we just had to go out into the hallway which at first I was pretty bummed out about, but it was totally fine and I really warmed up to the hotel. The normal rooms are HUGE, like no joke they’re so roomy. Especially our corner room, which had super high ceilings. Location is fantastic, being right in the middle of the city and right next to the cool gaudi building called “La Pedrerra” which is a fun afternoon trip. Overall though the hotel was great and the style they were going for was achieved very well. Would recommend if visiting Barcelona ",4
7325,"We spent Christmas Eve and day here and we're very disappointed. We were woken up to the cleaning maid barging into our room at 8am asking if we wanted the room cleaned whilst my boyfriend and I were asleep in bed. A few hours later, we then asked to take our morning coffee upstairs to the pool area to enjoy the sea view - the staff were very rude and said no and would not give us a reason why. The room was definitely not the room we booked on agoda, the description looked a lot newer and cleaner, it also advertised a large corner bath and instead we had a cold shower.   It was a real shame as we were looking forward to treating ourselves for Christmas Day in Nha Trang. ",2
7326,"You are treated like a Cannes film star from the moment you arrive. nothing is too much trouble . The rooms are large by most hotel room standards . The gym could have been bigger with more options but then the hotel only has 45 rooms .

The quality of the service since the first moment you come in; all the staff is super nice, respectful and willing to help you in a 100% with whatever you need (tourism, shopping, restaurants and clubs). From the courtesy beverage to the tidiness and clean spaces of showers bedrooms and salons is everything in a great friendly environment. Breakfast is not expensive and is all you can eat (plus is very yummy) . At nights you can join the bar for an express German class which is actually very fun because you get to meet all the other guests of the hostel and enjoy happy hour! Great great hostel with a very cool vibe and made my staying in Berlin an amazing experience!!!",5

We were too tired to tell the staff that night so we just all tried to cram onto the hide-a-bed couch without pillows & blankets because we didn't want them but left the sheets on.

7330,"Nice, clean, safe, and affordable budget hotel.   The CONs: The rooms are modern but small for North American standards - very minimalistic/practical, nothing fancy. Everything has been specially designed to maximize efficiency and use the least amount of square meters/feet.  You will have to pay extra if you want to watch TV or connect to WiFi. Housekeeping is also extra.   Having said that, now the PROs: This hotel is located on Rosenthaler Strße, in very lively area close to plenty of restaurants, cafes, bistros, shops, bars, and boutiques where the hip and not-so-hip crowds come out to play at night.  The location is very good. Close to Hackescher market, the Berlin Wall, Alexanderplatz, and the Pergamon museum.   They also have lockers where you can leave your luggage.

It reminded me (especially the bathroom) of a refurbished locker room (not necessarily a bad thing).  Reception staff were lovely and helpful. The breakfast was a little expensive so we ate out. The best thing about the hotel is the relaxed and ""local"" neighborhood it is in. A short walk to shops and restaurants and a little further to the beach. A 10 minute walk to the Metro, which we mastered over the 3 days, taking us all over the city.",4

One member of the staff was rude. 239.00 plus taxes and fees later. All I received was an apologetic note. If you need hard wired Internet, please try holiday inn express.  I am so pissed that I chose this hotel, spent 300.00 and missed work.

The breaker panel buzzed non-stop intermittently during my stay.  I came home one day and the apartment smelled of mildew, when it was completely fine when I left. Did I mention I got athlete's foot from the shower? As others have mentioned, the breakfast is awful. The coffee is particularly bad. Notwithstanding the 80 degree days during which the room temperature exceeded 75 degrees Fahrenheit, I was told there was no air conditioning.  My unit was a ""Premier"" apartment but I don't understand why. TV reception was terrible too. I will never stay here again and I do not recommend it for any extended stay.",2

I wanted outta there but they wouldn't give me my third night back, did get a new room, the AC actually worked in that one.   Breakfast was good and enough.

I thought it was odd, but im jet lag, he’s an employee, he won’t screw me, right?  Except when i presented my tickets to the bus company, their scan indicated I owed them the full amount....   I was not impressed, and felt quite ripped off.  After almost 30 mm on the phone where the Bus tour manager (hop on hop off) tried rectifying the situation without any success with the Orchard Garden hotel, the Bus company simply gave me back cash and told me they would “deal with the concierge” Rodney...

I told the front desk I need to take document out from my suitcase and did not want to open my suitcase right in front of everyone. I was told to use the public toilet. My advice to you is to lift your service at least to the level of Hilton Hongqiao. Furthermore, the incident on the following day when I was leaving the hotel to the airport, the porter asked me to use my own phone to call the taxi while he was busy serving other guests who came after me. My advice to you is to address the discrimination issue. It will improve your image.",2
7356,"To sum up my experience here, we moved rooms a total of 4 times. They kicked us out of the first one, the second one had ants in the bathroom, the third had one bed (we needed two) and then the fourth was finally what we stayed in for longer than 24 hours.  The halls smelt like pot, the rooms were musky and dated. The only positive thing about the hotel was a woman named Olga who actually did her job and helped us get the room we ended up staying in.

There are  many nice restaurants, cafes, supermarkets, cakes and pastries shops around the hotel. We love their small but very nice and cosy lounge area where we can have a coffee and chat about our day. Feel like home. On top of all these, thier front desk staff were very helpful in many ways especially Lorreta. Housekeeping is immaculately clean too.

Very grey and harshly lit hallways. On the other hand, the location is fantastic. Can’t get more central in Porto. Breakfast was good, but there were lineups both days we were there. No problem if you go early. Wifi was just “ok” in our room. We were part of a tour, so I don’t know about prices, but would stay again because of the location if the price was good.",3

Breakfast was terrible,  bread was stale and they serve it in the lobby and the little bar area on tables that are too low to eat at so its super uncomfortable to eat and enjoy. The selections were very average and overall disappointed.  Maybe they could add robes and some better cookie selections in evening.  Stay but go out for breakfast. One odd note is towel heater bar is too close to toilet and cant even use the toilet without leaning away. Finally front desk recommended a rip off market across the street with a pirate in front ,  they should better. Cheers",3

Would have preferred more light and brighter colours.  Our apartment was more a room with a mini kitchen - no bigger than an ordinary hotel room.  It was also dark, and the red walls didn't help. The bed was adequate, but not really top hotel quality.  Staff were helpful and polite. There was no breakfast room, but a popular bar at the hotel.  I agree with the comment that this is not a four star establishment - three stars is more appropriate.",3

On other days they ask up to 130 euro for the same room which is completely absurd when you compare this place to other, much better hotels in the vicinity. You get a renovated office with a good bed and a hot shower, but it all feels quite spartan. It's like a modern motel. Quite noisy as well.

It seems someone was rolling something around (barrels again, maybe? See my other review!) in the middle of the night...so avoid the first floor if you can.  Those who have read my other reviews know that I like relative peace and quiet, and when my company has paid a *lot* for such a room and expects me to be awake for meetings, it's not too much to ask for, is it?  Breakfast was quite good but nothing special. The staff were helpful…",3
7368,"If you don't speak Spanish, you don't want to be here. No one speaks English, including the front desk. It was frustrating ordering room service, getting housekeeping to do something, or organizing an airport transfer.  Aside from this fact, this is a 2 star hotel which hasn't been updated in quite a while. The rooms are somewhat clean, but spartan with few amenities. The gym on the roof is smoking hot, and limited in its equipment. The location is in Centro which is distant from the beaches and most other tourist destinations with lots of traffic, as well. The room service food was inedible, but it's hard to find a convenience store nearby, so you have to go eat the grilled meats from the street which were good.",2
7369,"Overall a good hotel, convenient location to walk or take bus to most attractions. We stayed for 6 nights. Bed comfy although pillows very soft, but this was rectified when I requested a firmer set of pillows. Room large and bathroom lovely. However, we always choose hotels which offer wifi, as we need this for our ipad to work. Despite complaining twice, and being given an alternative cloud log in, we still could not get a stable enough wifi connection to use our ipad so had to use our phones without wifi. Pretty poor since we managed to get wifi no problem even in Australian outback. No offer of compensation or really any solution or explanation.  ",4

The breakfast was very nice and we ate dinner two nights (limited menu and one night sat in office building due to function in dining room).  Staff was quite helpful and very nice.    BUT... we came home with absolutely EVERYTHING smelling of mildew (we call it jungle rot)!!  All of clothing, our expensive canvas rolling duffles and backpacks reeked.  The smell is horrible.  We had to get our luggage and back packs cleaned professionally and they still smell like moldy mildew.  And some of our clothes still carry that smell even after repeated washings 7 months later.  Would never stay there again because…",2
7371,"My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Felix for a Friday and Saturday night in November. The room was VERY, VERY small. The queen bed took up most of the room, along with a small desk and night stand there was barley room for our suitcase. There was no closet in the room. We stayed for the weekend so we brought snacks and stuff to make drinks. We had no room to prepare and enjoy our snacks and drinks, we had to sit on the bed all the time. We had to store our stuff on the floor under the desk. I stubbed my toes and banged my shins. I have traveled all over the world and stayed in hundreds of hotels and the Hotel Felix is the only hotel I have ever seen where there wasn't a coffee maker in the room.

I was assured that I would be able to do this so I went ahead and booked the hotel. Upon my arrival I was told that they were holding rooms for the airlines and could not give me any of the rooms that were clean as airlines had preference. I asked to speak to the manager who told I should have booked the previous night if I wanted to guarantee a room at that hour. They claimed they had no rooms available but I could see scores of people checking out. As well as checking in. I even asked if I could perhaps upgrade to a more expensive room and was denied this. And yet after continued requests they would not give me a room. The…,1

While there were excellent things about Andaz Amsterdam, the misses were glaring enough to make our overall experience a disappointment.  THE GOOD: Andaz Amsterdam is a beautiful property with a great location. It is within walking distance of museums, shops, and some pleasant eateries.    The staff is friendly and helpful.  We arrived early in the morning after a long flight from Africa and they made us comfortable until our rooms were ready.

When you arrive the try to push you to pay an extra €10 to upgrade your room and even try to show you the difference between the rooms when you say no.  The actual standard room in completely different to the pictures and description of the hotel. My room was large but very dated. The shower was Asian in style, basically a shower in the corner of the room with a curtain, no shower tray or proper enclosure.  If the hotel had more truthfully represented their hotel there is no way I would have stayed here.

It's an easy walk to the Eiffel Tower and the Seine, which came in very handy during the transportation strike!!  The metro was on strike and the cabs were in support (although some were driving, it was impossible to get one that would accommodate six of us).  We ended up taking the water taxi (a 10 minute walk from the hotel) to get around and that was a great help.  The air conditioning was wonderful after a long day of walking in the heat and with several restaurants and markets nearby, we never had to look too far.  The street the hotel is on is very quiet.  As others have mentioned, the breakfast was very nice.  Lots of shopping nearby also.",5

Upon check-out, we noticed an additional & undisclosed charge of $30 per night for the 'free wifi, gym, biz room, etc.', the very services their competitors either disclose in advance or, more often, provide as standard complementary services. When I returned and asked Denise at the front desk about the fees, she was dismissive and demonstrated little concern for customer service or satisfaction. I cannot recommend this hotel to others, as I think the whole thing is very poor on the part of the hotel and the staff added to the bad experience. ",1

No apology that they screwed up our evening.  At checkout I mentioned this and my person checking me out said we will make that we won't move you on your next stay. No chance here on me spending that kind of money on a hotel that treats guests like that. Poor customer service and no apology or remorse.  I live here in Chicago in Bucktown and have no problem telling everyone I know about my bad experience with you hotel. Thanks for wasting $900 and a night of my life.,1

I had to wait for about 15 minutes in the airport parking lots, to get on the limousine, which I gave kind understanding, it might be because the traffic. I assumed the room booked was a kind bed room, the staff brought me in a two double-bed room and said that's what you booked. I was tired and no words to say, that's how local people get normally.

Unfortunately there were flies and midges on the fruits and bread. The wifi wasn't working on the floors at all and in the lobby just very slow.

However, I don’t like at all the presence of the American bar at the ground floor; in fact is quite crowded, but it doesn’t exist a separation with hotel’s hall, finally there is quite confusion. Moreover, due to the presence of external guest it is not possible to use the stairs, but just the lift, so you can wait several minutes to catch the lift and go to your room.

No chairs, just a small stool to sit on, no kettle or means of making a drink.  Open shelves to put belonging on, accessed by climbing on the stool.  Six hangers for 2 people's clothes.  Breakfast was in basement down very small steep stairs and then a problem to find a table at which to sit.  An unrepeatable experience.",3

Of course it was for someone else in a different room but since they had the same last name as myself, the JW just decided to add it to my room.

Hiring a cab to get to and from the hotel is preferred unless you enjoy walking in the quiet business districts with few interesting sights.   However getting a cab is not easy when there are few available cabs on the roads especially the Pudong area at night. One can easily wait for 20-30 mins just to hop on a cab. It might help if the hotel provides shuttle bus services to and from the subway station.    As a luxury hotel brand, there are various aspects that can be improved. The house service was inconsistent as some of the bath items were not replenished all the time. The closet space was surprisingly small for a spacious hotel room and we…",2

They had some sheer curtains on the window - one was missing and the other two held together with a safety pin.  The coffee table had fingerprints all over it.  We asked to be moved and were moved the next morning to a much nicer apartment.  We had to ask for toilet paper to be refreshed and also tea towels - even though the room was serviced daily.  The building is quite run down and just dirty in places.  The staff at reception are lovely and certainly helpful.  The place just needs some TLC…,2
7428,Let me get my gripe out of the way. If room 532 is a deluxe room - I’m shocked.  It was tiny. Especially the bathroom. Just not what you expect from “deluxe”.   That being said we did enjoy our stay.  It’s a great location- ideal for shoppers especially as just 5 mind from KaDeWe.  Good tube links  Friendly staff Nice bar with outside seating   ,4
7429,"Thank you Sabine for your wonderful hospitality for Paige and myself!  The breakfast selection was  lovely and we appreciated being able to make small sandwiches for later in the day! I loved following your personal history thru your photos on the wall and the location was perfect!  Just so you know, the package I mailed back home arrived safely with all my souvenirs; thank you for your assistance. I hope every time you use the Louisiana tea towel, you'll think of us.",5
7430,"My husband and I have just returned after spending 5 days here. We loved the hotel, modern, clean, comfy bed and a fantastic shower!  Staff were always on hand 24/7 at Reception to assist if needed. Brilliant location with so many amazing restaurants and cafes nearby. We would definitely stay again!",5
7431,"We loved our stay at the Cosmo Hotel. The decor is beautiful, the rooms are well appointed, and the best thing is the staff. Always available to help, they were a wonderful resource for us. The lobby has bar, that was a terrific to relax at and a nice place to meet up with friends. The location is unbeatable, smack in the center of the city, with public transport close and bikes for easy rent at the ready. To our surprise, Berlin is an eminently bike-able city and the hotel rents the perfect bikes for this at nominal prices. When you go to a new city, you want to feel like you are staying where locals would, if they had to, and Cosmo Hotel has this feel.",5
7432,"Very good hotel with different type of decor all done in a very good way. Staff were very helpful in every way room was nice and clean. Though at first we thought that we were a bit too far out from the center,  the main Metro line was a few minutes walk away and this would take you to most places of interest , and it was easy to work out very much the same as the london tube.",5

Everything was comfortable and the best of it all, the location is absolutely excellent: - 15 minute walk from the Louvre - amazing restaurants are within its vicinity, including a great burger place right in front of it - 5 minute walk from Galeries Lafayette AND Lafayette Gourmet - 5 minute walk from Opera Garnier - 5 minute walk from the VERY convenient RoissyBus that takes you directly to CDG airport when you have to leave.",5

They were explaining they are overbooked because of Ultra, but there is a reason that I booked 3 months in advance!!! if you cant be responsible for what you promised you better stop running a hotel. finally we moved to a new room ( I had to cancel our plans in order to move our stuff and wait for another room to evacuate.) after we got the new room later that night when we came back to our room we had to wait 3 hours in the lobby because the lock on the door didn't work.

Very comparable bed. For the some reason the bathroom is in the entrance of the room and you have to go through it to get to bed. We stayed it the hotel for 3 nights but our room was only cleaned once for some reason. The staff is very kind in comparison to the very unkind people of Barcelona.  It’s a good hotel for those who only need to sleep in the hotel, but don’t want to compromise.",4

7439,"Hotel Concortel was a perfect little place to rest in the middle of the bustling city.  My room, although petite (as many are in Paris!) had enough space for me, my yoga may and a large bed. The bathroom was comfortably appointed with a separate space for the commode.  My room overlooked the central courtyard allowing me to open the windows for fresh air and no street noise.   Very peaceful!  And Eric at the front desk always greeted me with a smile and had many great local recommendations.  He always walked me to the door to be sure I knew where I was going... a small gesture that made me feel completely taken care of by him and his staff.  And the location was perfect for catching the train at St Lazare, the metro, shopping, parks and really feeling like I was living in Paris.…",5

It's a charming small family run place. The room was lovely and had everything we needed including a cold fridge. It's well cared for and finished with lovely towels, bedding and a comfy bed etc. We loved the balcony and I happily sat there at the end of a long day, each day, sipping wine. The breakfasts were nice, it's in a great location near the sea front, and main city area, (and not too far from the train station if you're not driving). A great find. Big big thanks to everyone that works here... it's a team effort clearly.",5
7442,"The staff, amentites and everything else you can think of is extremely disorganized and out of proportion. The problems began with arriving at the hotel, the bell staff was too engaged in conversation to assist people with their luggage. The front office staff seemed to be lost in the clouds and the room was average at best. The gold lounge lady was extremely creepy and pushy. The maids are friendly but clean right over you while you are attempting to enjoy your food. The furniture is worn and needs updating. NOT A 5 STAR HOTEL",1
7443,"We made the mistake of booking this hotel based on the Frommer's description of it as ""refined.""  There were some positive aspects: The Microcentro location is fine and centrally located.  The staff are friendly, courteous and helpful.  The small lobby is pleasant but too small for the activity level and the frequent stacks of luggage waiting there; and there are often long waits at the 2 small elevators. Our biggest problem was the room.  We booked a double deluxe because the standard rooms were not available.  However, although the deluxe rooms are bigger than the other categories, the decor is the same: drab like a low-end motel.  We had to change rooms because the ""deluxe"" bathroom has a very large jacuzzi tub with a fixed partition extending about 2/3 the length of the tub…",2

The bathroom was also a good size, and towels were changed daily even though we had not requested this. The hotel is just a couple of minutes' walk from the station and central Cannes, but despite this central location it is extremely quiet and peaceful. The owner was very friendly (as was his dog!), and also gave us good advice about places to visit and where to eat locally. We also opted to have breakfast there each day (11 euros supplement), and were very glad we did. It was lovely, and included fresh orange juice, local jams, croissants, French bread etc. The whole stay struck me as…",5

Amazing people at the reception who fight with LATAM to get my suitcase back !! I will come back for sure !",5

It was also quiet despite facing the railway station, as we were located on an upper floor with double glazed windows and an extra door to seal out hallway noise.    All the usual hotel amenities were provided including free Wi-Fi, A/C and room safe.  However for a business-oriented hotel there was a notable lack of electrical outlets in the room.    We ate in the restaurant for dinner but the food was bland and unremarkable.  For exhibitionists there is a floor to ceiling window next to the bathtub -- we left the shade pulled down!""",3
7450,Really good service. Warm welcoming from staff and they even gave us toothbrushes when we asked where to buy some.  There is lots of nice restaurants nearby aswell in which you see locals and your issues there. The food is excellent. The metro is literally 1minute walk away. Bathroom is small but that's just like most hotels in Paris. Overall a really good service. The roombwas clean aswell and they brought fresh towels everyday! ,5

Continental break was included and was good. A number of restaurants, pubs, supermarkets, shops (medium to pricey) around and the Zoo is less than 10 minutes walk. The main tourist buses and underground stations are similarly located.",4

The hotel said that I ""requested"" a two bed room but it wasn't guaranteed.  However, that was never disclosed to me during the reservation phone call. As far as I knew, I had a reservation for a two bed room.  They were not interested in figuring out if their employee booked my room incorrectly... shame on them!  It shows they don't care about you and your satisfaction.  They offered $50 for the missing shower curtain but no compensation for the fact that my 18 year old son had to spend the night in the same bed with another 18 year old kid... awkward and ridiculous!  I would never recommend this hotel. The only reason I picked this…",1

The rooms are well decorated, modern, clean and... quiet! (Although I had the impression the hotel was not fully booked.) Furthermore, the room had more than enough space and the bathroom was equipped to the latest fashion. One point of concern is the (in-bath) shower, but that is the only thing I could argue about.   Anyway, everyone in the hotel seems to want to smile (which I have not experienced in a whole lot of French hotels!) and they were very helpful.   I would absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to visit Paris. ",5

We also walked to the Mauerpark flea market on Sunday morning in a leisurely 30 min pace and took the U-Bahn back in about 15. Really well situated to move around the city but also return back for a rest. The room we had faced the Netto on the back of the building. It was very quiet. he room was spotlessly clean and the bathroom was very nice. The shower was hot and great pressure with a rainhead shower.

Connection to Amsterdam is only 20 minutes.  Overall a good stay. ",3

In a party of four, we had originally booked into a six-bed dorm but were happy to find out we had been put into a four-bed dorm, which was great. The room wasn't that big, but big enough for what we needed and good if you're only looking for somewhere to rest your head.   Location wise it was great. There was the tram and underground literally right outside, allowing you to get to Alexanderplatz or further in minutes.

We arrived at the parking lot, the Hotel offers Valet Parking on site, price is 130$ for 3 nights (incl. tax). When getting back your car, check it very thoroughly for any dents and scratches, our car was damaged when we received it.

I canceled due to the rude staff and a month later, I have found they charged my card $500 for a ""no show."" I explained the situation to the manager of the front desk and he had zero sympathy and refused to refund my money. Absolutely disgusted by the people at this hotel. AVOID!!!

We also appreciated the air-conditioning as it was an unusually hot summer in Paris. The breakfast was a perfect start to the day and the staff even gave us a take-away package when we had to leave before the scheduled breakfast time on one of our days there.  The location is wonderful and we would certainly recommend the hotel to any travelers looking for a budget-friendly hotel with an attentive staff.",5

There was a slightly reduced rate for the conference, but the room was still expensive compared to others in the city.  The hotel is indeed unusual in shape. This is reflected in the strange shape of the rooms, with a mini ski type slope reducing the usable floorspace of the rooms. I arrived at 07.45 and apart from suites only disabled rooms were available. Rather than wait for what might have been several hours I agreed to take such a room, being charged half a day's rate for that privilege.

No cart and no where to sit and eat. Only 1 chair in room. Coffee service in lobby was terrible...coffee was lukewarm. Chicken piccata implies cutlets pounded thin....this was a thick chicken breast. Zucchini spaghettini has curry hummus scooped on top. No match!   I told the front desk at check out about my dissatisfaction....he said sorry. No adjustment at all. ,2

The overall service got a really plunged down while i was asking to extend my stay for one more night, as my flight is only about to take off around 2:00 a.m. The reception lady asked if i would mined to change a room, and i just replied that any room will be ok for me.

On the other side the cleanliness of our room was less than average - the bathroom smelled from mould, water taps were corroded. The room would definitely benefit from redecorating. On the first day we found spider web right on the bed frame. The cleaning-lady “cleaned- out” our room floor with completely dirty black water. The result was that it left some odour.

The accommodation is fine - but the food is very average and catering is for the masses - so don’t expect to be pampered! Generally - the Staff are abrupt and not trained to handle guests - we’ve had better service and appreciation of our business from 3 Star hotels!! There is a lot of competition in Madeira and they need to appreciate their guests or downgrade their rating so guests are not surprised. In summary I would recommend this hotel - but only on a special deal - do not pay 5 Star prices for a 3 star resort!,3

I did not appreciate having to pay 60 Euro to check in a few hours early even though our room was ready, but my mom felt compelled because she was traveling with a work laptop. The room did not include wash cloths, only one ""bath sponge"", which was not enough for two people. The room also did not include a hair dryer. But the decor and comfort of the room was very average. It was a bit hard to find given the multiple small streets around the area and fact that it is pedestrian only during the day and most of the night. It is in a great location though!",3

Issues: Poorly trained staff at front desk that was seen being scolded by many visiting guests, poor housekeeping as evidenced by inadequate cleaning of bathrooms and non replacement of toiletries. Bathrooms with marginal hygiene, inadequate toilet cleanliness & flushing and intermittent hot water availability, The service staff left used cups and utensils overnight in the room instead of picking them up.

My room wasn't ready which was OK as it was about 12 noon but I could leave my suitcase there whilst I went about my business. Check in is at 3.00 pm and I went back about 4.15 pm in the expectation of my room being ready. However I wasn't pleased to find out that it wasn't as the maid had had to go to hospital. Also they couldn't give me an estimate of when it would be ready. However a lady came down and said that there had been some sort of a mix up and the room was ready. Not a very good start!  However apart from this blip my stay was very pleasant.  My room was on the top floor (6th) and although it was warm and no aircon and the window was open it…,4
7489," My experience comes from around 60 hotel stays all over the world since 12yrs in business and 20yrs in private  To make it short! Pro: - big pool - can not be closer to the beach and sea - fall asleep and wake up with the best sound in the world the waves - always fun with all the airline employees from all over the world  Versus: -Bad trained service all over - you feel that you just a room number no personal feelings - overpriced - offers tennis, basketball and a lot over other resort options but Basketball is closed and that you figure out after 1hr of asking all over the resort tennis i found out after 20min walk around that I had to pay for out! The view is Great but the quality of the tennis racket is very poor - rooms are very old like 60s and far away from up to date  -…",2
7490,I recently stayed at the lovely Esprit St. Germain.  The location was a perfect base for a mother/daughter trip to Paris.   From the moment we walked in we were treated like family.  The service is excellent and the rooms are beautiful!  The hotel is boutique and intimate in the neighborhood of the left bank of Paris.   We truly felt at home in this beautiful hotel!    We especially enjoyed relaxing in the lounge listening to soft music while having a glass of wine unwinding from the day.  We will definitely return!  Thank you Esprit St. Germain!,5
7491,"Loved this funk hotel on the outskirts of Amsterdam. Hotel in the round has fantastic views all around and skyline restaurant. Rooms were nice and spacious with funky facilities and good views. However, it is a good bit away from the metro and any transportation so you either arrange taxis or the shuttle bus which is not reliable. After waiting 30mins for it to take us to the metro station it left without us. So in all it was 40 mins before we got there. On our return from the city at 10.05pm we saw the bus take off as we were just leaving the metro station. We phoned for it to return 3times before it finally arrived at 10.45pm standing in the cold with no shelter.......not good! So you cant rely on this to fetch and carry you anywhere! The rest of our stay was superb. ",3
7492,"This hotel has been around for a long time and it has a certain quaint ambiance. All rooms have a theme in the form of an actor or a film. It is way past it's prime though. Lamps are out of order, the furniture really worn (my wardrobe would not open fully) and the service in the lobby is not great. Breakfast is quite ok but the restaurant serves poor pizza and rather tasteless burgers in the evening. Avoid.",3
7493,"It was nice to stay at the place so convenient in terms of well equiped rooms, great dining. One thing which is visible is too sterile and fed-up approach of majority of staff. Many of them, simply hardly manage to hide their superbness, or disinterest towards quests. The fact that people who are working there every day, doesn't change anything in the eyes of the guests who are in the hotel for the first time and can't know enough not to ask questions. ",4
7494,"we stayed here earlier this month with another couple.  Rooms are a bit like Ikea , very modern but comfortable, warm and clean.  Shower and under floor heating in bathroom are amazing.  We werent disturbed at all during our stay, no noise from outside or other guests.   Lots of  choice at breakfast including hot eggs and meatballs.  Staff were very helpful, lady on reception organised our booking for hop on/hop off bus tour and charged my friend's mobile phone for her.   We were in Berlin for the Christmas markets and this hotel is in good location.  Short walk to trains, trams and taxis available outside hotel door. Ideal for a short city break",5
7495,We stayed 3 nights at this hotel.   The staff in general were really great and very friendly.   Some of the things that sort of turned us off were regarding the room.   We paid for a “ deluxe” room but ended up on level 2 which is basically a basement level.  The hotel is set in a steep hill....our room had a window well that had very little natural light.  That just didn’t feel much like a “ deluxe “ room.  The beds were also very hard and the pillows were huge and hard foam.  Not a very comfortable bed!    Linens were pretty average...just not up to standard in my book for a 4 STAR hotel. The other sub par thing for me was the morning coffee.   They only serve coffee from a Nespresso machine :( That was a drag!   We did eat dinner in the restaurant one night and it was great. …,3
7496,"Our first night here, a large group of Guests had checked in, one of them had one of the best suites in the hotel right next to us. So they all decended on this room, firstly it was a party in the 11th floor lobby, then after complaints from all the effected guests this was continued within the suit. These people behaved like animals but still were allowed to continue by the hotel. We were offered another room & eventually we took up that offer & moved at about 1.30 am. Great first night here!  I do not believe the actions taken by the hotel were appropriate, guests should not be moved from their rooms due to unacceptable behavior of other guests. Deal with the  issue please.  I will not make further comment on the hotel services as I feel this experience has somewhat tainted my…",2
7497,"Arrived here on Thursday 14th with 5 other people and was pleasantly surprised, we was only supposed to check into our room from 3pm but as we arrived early, the woman on the check out let us check in around 11am. We was really happy with the room and had no complaints about the whole hotel altogether, however on our last night we asked if we could possibly have a later check out the next day as our flight was only at 9pm, again, the woman on the desk told us we could have the room until 3pm for €50 only which we was really happy about. However the next day at approximately 11:30am we was woken up by two of the ""receptionists"" walking into our room demanding we leave and claiming a ""late check out"" does not exist and just a bad attitude in general when asking us to clean up…",3
7498,"I had a wonderful 5 night stay at the Hotel l'Olivier. The staff are very sweet and helpful. I felt very welcome which is nice after a 9 hour flight! The breakfast is a highlight, largely due to the beautifully bright and colorful dining area where you can look out at the old church tower while having coffee and croissants. My room was of modest size and very quiet. The location is just steps way from the museum, church tower, and le Suquet area with its romantic little lanes and restaurants.",5
