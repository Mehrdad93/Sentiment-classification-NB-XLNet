0,Not at all what expected.   Our mountain view was of the garage.  Asked to move but no rooms available and they said this was considered mountain view since it wasn't ocean view.   This was a business trip so if I was paying for this I would have been livid.  Would suggest if you book this place guarantee your view for the prices they charge.  No storage in bathroom at all.  Razor barely fit.  The three drawers provided were all this tiny and no space on the sink.    There coffee table is the size of a postage stamp so don't plan on putting anything there.  The rooms that they have for hotel guests are small.  Beware also the rooms have doorbells so kids and some guests like to ring these at all hours day and night.  We did complain so they had security do extra rounds.  Why a…
1,"Good location as we needed to head to Reims the next day and the hotel is literally opposite the train station where we needed to catch the train from. I might have found it too noisy otherwise. But this time t suited me perfectly! The receptionist Juliana was wonderful, she greeted us with a warm smile and was very helpful subsequently when I needed assistance. We got upgraded to a deluxe twin room. Very clean, albeit a small room, it has everything even a desk and a chair! The mini bar has 3 drinks and they were complimentary for the hotel guests, nice touch! The definite plus was Juliana, she made her guests feel so welcomed. "
3,"Me and my son just returned from Broadmoor Miami Beach. Hotel smells like an old building. Upon entering my room, i was greeted by an unpleasant foul stench. In Room 307 with a partial ocean view we saw a bunch of roaches in the bathroom. I complained and the woman at the front desk said that they never had roaches and i was the only one who complained, nevertheless, they upgraded us to a room with a better ocean view- 402.  There are a few helpful staff working at the front desk who were trying to compensate for the messy hotel, but at the end of the day nothing really helped to smooth our stay there. The Elevator was not always working and was very slow- we always took the stairs to get to the 4th floor. This served as an issue upon leaving the hotel with our suitcase.The…"
4,"The place was filthy and full of stoned backpackers... Expected a budget, but romantic weekend - ended up tired of people screaming and laughing. Additionally, came back bitten by bed bugs :( The food and drinks were really cheap and delicious, though. If you miss some European food, I totally recommend their burgers."
6,"The hotel itself is really nice and modern which quirky artwork and facilities. The rooftop bar has amazing views, however, the drinks are very pricey and are alot cheaper elsewhere. A Sangria in a standard bar or restaurant in the city is about €4.50 however on the rooftop bar it's €12. The breakfast at the hotel is great and one of the best variety of foods I've seen at a hotel. The service from the staff at the hotel was also great. The only way I'd suggest the hotel improving is having a facility for people at the hotel to fill up water bottles for free. I had to spend €4 on a 33cl of water at the hotel bar. The area of the hotel isn't the best, it's in the Gothic Quarter which is okay but the last 5 mins of the walk to the hotel from the centre of town isn't great, feel…"
8,This is now the third time I've stayed here and each time I have been unable to check in at 3pm at the stated time. The front desk staff was rude and explained that check in starts at 3pm and can gonall the way to 5 pm. Ummm..I paid almost $300 to stay here. The Super 8 let's you check in on time and even earlier. They need to hire more cleaning staff and friendlier front dest staff. I will not stay her any longer or recommend  this hotel. Please don't book here if you actually need to check in before dinner. 
9,"Oh boy, do I wish there was an option on the IHG app to get a room away from families. When you travel on business, you need to get a good night sleep, but at this hotel it was impossible. I was put in a room next to rooms that had multiple junior high kids. At about 6am, SLAM SLAM SLAM!!!! Doors slamming for almost 2 hours straight. PLEASE IHG, think of some way to put families on one side of your hotels, and business travelers on the other. This Spire Elite member is a tired, unhappy camper this morning."
10,"Took 45 min to check in, only one person working the front counter. As I arrived in my room I asked for extra towels and blankets and they forgot. Had to call a second time after an hour of waiting. Beds are extremely uncomfortable. Carpet was dirty, bath tub was dirty. Unable to plug coffee maker in vanity had to move it to the room where it was u safe for my kids. "
11,Great hotel with nice and clean rooms. Kind and helpful staff. Their partner hotel next door has a pool that is available for this hotel guests. Close to the city centre but calm and quiet area. Breakfast availavle.
12,"A dump, crabby staff, dirty and worn out furnishings. If you want frustrating stay, book this hotel. Very cold and uncaring staff. I couldn’t believe this was a Hilton Hotel. I was shocked by its appearance and condition of furnishings."
14,"I stayed there for one night and it was pretty good. The interior is old, makes you feel like you are in a museum. The bed was a bit squeaky, but the blankets and the pillows were good.  The floor is very loud :) makes you hear everything your neigbors are doing.  The breakfast is amazing, very tasty and wonderfully served!  I had to leave my stuff for a while after a check-out and had no problem with that.  Overall, it's definitely a ""B+""."
15,"We stayed at the nhow Hotel in August 2019. It was an unforgettable experience to have a Gibson guitar to be played in our room for 24 hours - for free.  We enjoyed sitting on the terrace enjoying a drink with view of river Spree and watchig the sunset over Oberbaum Bidge. The breakfast was very good with a lot of different delicious food. Nhow Berlin has also an art gallery and some studiios.We loved to be there because of the great atmosphere, the location next to the river and the pssibility to try out a great guitar.       This hotel is very close to the East Side Gallery. Public transportation is close to the hotel."
17,I had the distinct displeasure of dealing with a manager by the name of Rodrigo Callo. He is CLUELESS when it comes to hospitality customer service. There are other nice hotels in the area which are closer to better dining and shopping options. This place is a bit tricky to locate and not really walking distance from anything nearby (must take taxis everywhere). The restaurants are below average and they prices are very high even for a Hilton branded hotel.
18,"The hotel has good, nice and clean rooms (my previous stay) and bad, old, not really clean rooms (this stay). The atmosphere of the room is cold, old, outdated wallpaper and very uncomfortable beds. The bathroom has stains in every corner and the metal is getting oxyded. The floor is really tired and has marks of the thousands of people that went through this room. There is a free small bottle of water in the room as if the hotel had to be forgiven for something ...  Overall, I had a good experience, my new one is really bad. I will probably look for another choice in the city."
19,"I do not care much about the looks of a hotel. I just ask for a clean bed and bathroom and I am happy. This hotel did not even deliver that. The front desk personnel was unfriendly, pillows and sheets were dirty and smelly, the sofa had several stains, the little table had something yellow and sticky that I don't want to know what it was. It is just a bad hotel. It reminds me about a $20 room I got in Mexico. Of course this costs $150. Lesson learned. "
20,"We arrived on September 14th and we leave on September 19th. As a student at a hospitality and luxury hotels management, I can tell that the customer’s services is not reached... Indeed, we came yesterday with an agency and during the check in no welcome word. The only sentence the receptionnist told us is « can you give me your credit card for the deposit... », we had no information about wifi, breakfirst time, nothing, they let us on our own...  it’s true that the agency ask for an upgrade so as a VIP guest we are regarding about the quality and the care that a Starwood Mariott Hotel (the most important group) can give us. Yesterday night we had a problem in our room, it was « rainning » in the dressing, a air conditionning issue, some water was sinking. So I call the…"
21,"Way to much money for what you get. The room smelled of heavy cleaner/fragrance like it was masking something. The fan in the bathroom was falling down from the ceiling. The bed was lumpy, the TV remote did not work and the balcony light was on  photocell and could not be turned off. The ocean view was nice but $300.00+ dollars per night was too much for this quality of room. We had a great time in Pismo and will return. Just not to this property."
22,"How is this a Double Tree?? Besides not having cookies, this place was totally not on Hilton's level. The breakfast was a disappointment. Everything was super poor quality. If you're a vegetarian, all there is to eat are cocoa puffs and fruit. Even the pastries have meat in them.  I booked here because I have Hilton Dimond Status - usually I get at least two free water bottles (among other things), but not here."
23,"hotel , room was clean , breakfast was ok staff were nice location was good for shops & restaurants their was a McDonald's downstairs as well from hotel which was handy for a snack on way back from pub !!  There wasn't many pubs about that we seen , we did go to one about a 20 min walk from hotel was a Irish bar & it was massive with a good band on diffract band each night , was always busy its in the Europa centre , overall good hotel"
24,"I took my boyfriend to Berlin for a long weekend as a Christmas present, and we stayed in Hotel Amano, Friday to Monday. It was incredible. The hotel is perfectly situated near a large variety of bars and restaurants, as well as many small supermarkets, cafes, pharmacies, and clothing stores. The hotel is approximately a 10 minute walk to Alexanderplatz, and the TV tower, and is a 2 minute walk from the Rosenthaler U-bhan, making almost anywhere in Berlin easily accessible. The hotel itself was spotless, the lobby is very cool and modern, yet glamorous and tastefully decorated. The staff were warm and welcoming. The only slight criticism I had was that check in was only at  3pm, and there was no option to paying for an early check in however this was ultimately fine as they…"
25,"Lots of issues. AC not working, elevators not working, curtain falling, smoke smell every day, wifi very slow or not working, breakfast needs to be replenished more often. Shower base very dangerously slippery"
26,"Location great for site seeing in City of Berlin, walks along the river lead you quickly to the main historical buildings. Staff are welcoming and professional, helpful and informative. Hotel value style with modern style, no eating facilities outside of breakfast times but I close proximity to good restaurants. Breakfast buffet well worth paying for with a large choice of foods. Very near to rail station Bellevue. Rooms clean and contain all you need Bar well stocked and comfortable "
27,This was one of the smallest and dirtiest hotels ever. The lobby is very deceiving because it looks nice. But oh my goodness this hotel was so nasty and the floors made me want to throw up. I left the room within thirty minutes and received a full refund. Very pleasant people and reasonable rates. That's the only good thing. Oh and the elevator is the size of a bathroom stall!!
29," I will start the positives.. was an amazing hotel, we stayed in the villa with the pool, views were amazing and comfortable walking distance to the village.. the concierge had an amazing person name Mary who was just soo helpful and 5 stars to her.. she literally planned our whole stay in santorini and kudos to her.. our trekking guide who was also the gym instructor was very good.. the walk to oia in the morning Is a must do.. in fact it was the highlight of our trip..the wine tasting was good as well..  the negatives.. the room was good but for the money you are paying not upto the standard.. the bathroom was dark and not comfortable.. the price was very steep as well and the breakfast was ok.. for the price we paid we just expected a bit better.. "
30,"Such a cute little boutique property 2 minutes away from Courcelles metro station and about five minutes from Malsherebes - making it really easy to get around Paris. I was a bit hesitant to book this due to the location, but it's located in an upscale residential area, which has lots of great shops and cafes without the throngs of tourists. And, is still very convenient to any of the sights. Our room was really cute and the beds were very comfortable. Super clean room and bathroom. My only constructive criticism here would be it would have been great to have a towel rack or shelving for the towels (they were sat on the tub). Would recommend without hesitation!"
31,"You'll have to keep pinching yourself to prove that your stay at Le Cavendish is really happening. From the beautiful boutique rooms replete with gowns and slippers to the generous hospitality of the free bar, this is the kind of hotel that holiday wish lists are made of. Best of all, there's nothing 'try-hard' or forced about Le Cavendish - it exudes the quiet self-confidence, that comes from sheer hard work and determination to get everything right. The result is a relaxed oasis with warm, witty staff and very contented guests. I will be back and back and...."
32,We booked the hotel because it was the closest one to the Rhum festival. Hotel quite far away from the city centre but still  close to a metro station. Very nice small hotel with a friendly staff. Quiet hotel. Nice and comfy room. Worth the stay !
33,"The rooms were excellent, the facilities were great. The noise from the traffic below was quite loud and the noise from the nightclub on the 7th floor was terrible, we were on the 6th floor and the noise of the base went on until 4am, fortunately this only happens on a Friday and Saturday.   A good pair of earplugs is required."
34,"There are only a few elevators working, there’s construction with jackhammers, picketers our front. Do NOT stay on a high floor, you’ll wait in the elevator line to get to your room for at least 10 minutes and there are no stairs. Room wasn’t very comfortable, no one to clean our rooms. Pretty terrible experience, although San Francisco is beautiful just don’t stay here!"
35,Excellent modern hotel. Big rooms with king size bed and living room.  Walking distance to football and basketball courts for Barça games. Gym available 24 hours. Outdoor pool only available in season.
36,"I travel for work often, and this is probably one of the worst hotels I've stayed at. There were these weird little flies in my bathroom, the carpet has definitely seen A LOT of traffic, and there was a strange mildew smell in the room. Although the staff was nice and very helpful, the place is in serious need of renovations. The hotel restaurant was awful- I ordered the bread, cheese, and olive appetizer and they brought me an plate of what seemed like leftover bread pieces and some ""to-go"" butter packets. The manager did replace the plate, but it wasn't much better. I ate there several nights, out of necessity, and wasn't exactly impressed with the rest of the options.  I was originally staying at another hotel further up but the traffic was making my commute unbearable. So I…"
37,Food choices are not good. Have no ATM or money exchange. TV is only in Chinese. Nothing close for restaurants.No grocery or convenience store close. Staff was nice and hotel was clean. No club services for Hyatt member.
38,"No room service no bar down stairs ! No facilities, pool is so tiny ! Housekeeping stingy with hygiene products! They put one of each and when I ask them they say they don’t have ! The breakfast didn’t have many choices! And when we were trying to put on our plates they kept removing everything! With out even asking if we want some ! No room service and the front desk gave us a list of restaurants to deliver especially that everything around us was $$$$ sign ! But half of the list were permanently closed restaurants! That needs to be updated ! It’s so not worth what I paid for ! I wish I stayed by Damen or down town ! "
39,"Great hotel as always. I am never disappointed for staying at a motel one. Nice and comfy beds, clean rooms and bathrooms and they have a breakfast which is quite nice for a city hotel with that price. I like staying at Motel Ones. "
40,"The hotel is modern, clean, renovated and in a very quite location - far away from the crowd, yet well located with 5min walk to the underground (L1, few stations from city center / Plaça de Catalunya), the tramway and 15min walk to the Sagrada Familia. Even a bus from Parc Güell brings you close to the hotel. It is a good location to visit the city for a first time. Special mention to the personal who was extremely kind and very helpful.   A great feature of the room is the kitchen with fridge, microwave etc. - with our small kids, we could simply shop at Carrefour nearby (2 stations tramway) and have dinner in the room. Both kids (6 & 7yrs old) slept on a sofa, which was okay (we had to put some pillows around the mattress to fill some holes). But with older kids, we would…"
42,"Room was ready and we had an early check-in which is good. However the key card didn't work inside the room, therefore power was cut-off every 5 mins. Maintenance personnel temporarily over-ride system on the 1st night and rectified it on the 2nd day. There wasn't complimentary sparkling wine as promised by the manager in the email when we booked as this is our honeymoon though. "
44,"Location: Right on the river and Bellevue train station is just an 8 minute walk. Being next to the river there is a nice long walkway all along the river for cycling, walking or jogging. Several restaurants and cafes in close proximity and an organic grocery store next door.   Length of stay: 4 nights.   Type of Room: Family Room with Loft. We were a family of 10 (6 adults and 4 children under the age of 9) and had booked 3 identical rooms. The bedroom part of the room is located below the ground with extremely large windows and the loft part is above ground. The bedroom can accommodate 2 adults and sofa bed which is in the loft can accommodate the children. The sofa bed is not comfortable at all for adults. The bedroom and bathroom were of a good size.  Amenities in the room:…"
45,Stayed one night at the Connect hotel in Kista when on a business trip. The hotel is new and clean but fairly basic. Beds and pillows are ok but a bit hard. Breakfast has the basic stuff you can expect. For one night's stay on a business trip it is ok. For a longer stay or on a holiday trip I would find some other place to stay.
46,"I stayed at your hotel by the Chicago airport on May 1st, I ordered room service, at your already insane price ($28 for a small bowl of spaghetti? REALLY?) Despite this, I ordered for my family.  I asked the price at time of order and was told $83. Fine.    The bill shows up, and its $104.11.  My wife pays and gives a tip as I had just stepped out of the room.  I get back and look at the reciept and see all your fictional additional charges ontop of your already insane prices.  $5 Delivery charge. Why? Do you not already pay your guys for the 2 minutes it took to walk it over?   4% administration fee. Now I'm starting to get upset.  Is it really not included for someone to answer the phone and DO THERE JOB when you order room service? It is at the dozen of other hotels I stay at…"
47,"Good check in by a young lady. Room at rear of building.Sparkling wine ,chocolate strawberries,mini bottles of port and custard tarts supplied on the house to surprise my wife. Well done Management. Comfortable bed and some English speaking stations on tv. Good bathroom with large bath and bidet.Not too generous with supplies. Corridor carpets need attention. Breakfast was just ok.Have had better at Holiday Inn at Huntington UK recently. Bar was always quiet so only used it twice.Beer prices low for a Hotel. Staff were friendly especially at breakfast Check out was quick. The hotel location was too far out of down town.My mistake regretfully. Very few bars or restaurants in the area. Heavy traffic on main roads in the area. I would not stay here again only due to the location."
48,"Hotel Oderberger is located in the charming Prenzlauer Berg district.  The hotel is well run, clean and with an excellent breakfast. We stayed in a room of the category ""MAISONETTE"" and it is well equipped and very nice. However, note that the ceiling height in the bedroom is 1.70 meters, which is also written on the hotel website.  I would like to recommend this hotel and will of course come back again. Thank you for a pleasant stay."
49,"We stayed for ten days..only because we had already paid. I am sure that there are some good features about this resort. The rooms were clean, lovely beach and very big swimming pool. The 3 singers from the Phillipines were excellent. The buffet was an ordeal both for breakfast and lunch, we went to the beach retaurant every evening and the buffet was slightly better.. Slightly. It is hard to put my finger on what was so wrong with this supposedly 4 star resort. The staff were unhappy, lacked interest and had little or no motivation. The Spa was even worse, although beautifully located, it appeared to be a great effort for the reception even to talk to potential customers. I would advise anybody to look for a different hotel on this beautiful island that has such potential."
52,"We spend 4 days at this apartment hotel. A large room with kitchenette and good bathroom. They don't clean during your stay, so you don't get fresh towels, so we brought our own. Room has dishwasher and mucrowave, as well as toaster.  Location is close to busses, u-bahn, eateries and shops.  I would stay here again, good value!  If "
53,Having stayed at this hotel several times and being a new lifetime diamond member of Hilton Honors I was very disappointed in the lack of service for simple things such as having to call for ice to be delivered and no replacement of clean glasses until the last day. The biggest problem was the CO2 detector goin off in the middle of the night and taking over a a hour and half to get someone to fix it. Could have gotten much better service for a lot less money around the block.
54,"This is a cheap hotel, in a great location. The rooms are small, yet this is made very clear at the time of booking, and all the extras are paid, which again is clear. There are plenty of restaurants close at hand, and the Rosenthaler Platz U-bahn and tram stations are within a 2 minute walk. The back-factory is next to the tram stop, and is a good place for cheap breakfast or lunch. There is a reasonable currywurst place close at hand, and a italian takeout/cafe too."
55,"We had an excellent stay at the Champs Elysees Plaza for a 6 day vacation. It was perfectly located for gettting around the city by foot. We look forward to staying here again on our next visit to Paris.  The staff was very friendly, helpful and professional. "
57,"Stayed here was part of our short-break deal and we were both disappointed and pleased with differing aspects of this hotel. The continental breakfasts were more than adequate with an excellent selection of food and beverages. Evening meals in the 17th floor restaurant not only afforded fantastic views over the city but with attentive service and good food, there wasn't always a need to find somewhere else to eat. Although catering for an international clientele, there was a choice of some traditional Portuguese dishes to try. Our disappointment lay in our room. Although plenty big enough, and very clean too, it was so dark. Even in daylight hours, we had to have all the lights on. The mattress was very hard which will not suit everyone, causing, as in our case, disruptive…"
58,"While the building was beautiful and historic, the service provided to us was severely lacking for a hotel of this price.  After requesting early check in, and waiting for hours, our room was still not ready at the regular check in time of 4 pm.  All we were offered was bottled water while we waited.  After asking several times what was going on, management did finally offer us their ""penthouse"" room, but it did not have enough beds, which was not acceptable as one of my sons was sick at the time.  Finally, when our room was ready, our luggage was brought out and dumped at our feet with no offer of getting a luggage rack or getting the help of a staff person to help us with our luggage.  Price and reputation do not always equal great service.  If we return to Chicago, we'll seek…"
59,"Visited Rio for a conference. City was amazing. The hotel has great potential, but slips up in many ways.  Internet is shocking- staff aware, but simply unable to fix.  Service is very poor overall. Occasional staff members are great, but mostly very quiet and unhelpful. They often won’t even attempt to communicate.  Rooms are neat and secure, but need a really good clean.  Restaurant is rather generic and sterile.  Nearby beach is excellent. Hotel location is a long way from city attractions though.  This place could be great, but is let down by issues outlined above. Only stay here if you’re attending a conference at the adjacent centre. "
60,"The hotel was booked through BA using Avios, and was originally intended for 5 days. However this was extended (another story) at short notice to 8 days. I had to pay for the extra three days at the full rate on that day but even considering this, I found the hotel to be fair value. We were a family party of four; two adults and two children (12 & 10). The rooms were adjoining and a good size. Clean. Well stocked.  The hotel location was perfect for tourists; a 15 minute walk in any direction put you within reach of most of the sites. A tube station was right outside.  The staf were polite, well spoken (in English, no problem at all) and helpful.  We didnt use the hotels restaurant facilities as we prefer to find local cafes and restaurants (there are plenty nearby) but I'm sure…"
61,"I am a Diamond member and i had booked a Deluxe Panorama King room.  Now as a Himont Honors Diamond member, i am entitled to a high floor and executive floor access anyway.  In addition, i am entitled to a room upgrade if available.  all of the is clearly published on my reservation as well.  Yet, when i checked in, i was offered an ""upgraded"" room which it was not.  I even asked the gentlemen, Kevin how this was different and he said first proceeded to tell me that it was on a higher floor and with executive access.  When i corrected him and told him that didn't constitute an upgrade because i was entitled to that anyway, he changed his story and said it was a ""much bigger"" room.  Of course, when i came to the room and checked online, i discovered that it was exactly the same…"
62,The floor of the shower is not properly slanted to drain the water. In fact if you push the water to the drain it would come back at you. Because of the standing water mold has developed along the caulking around the shower walls and flood junction.  The elevators are being upgraded and we had to wait for them as the they were always full. Before you stay here be sure the upgrade is done.  
63,"I spend two nights at the Cocoon with 2 friends to enjoy the last days of my  vacation. I knew that the hotel is located quit far from the city center, but I was disappointed to discover that the property has actually no views of the sea. I thought if they build an hotel outside, it would be at least beachfront. The Hotel is located around 300m from the sea. As I checked out the website before, I was well prepared for the modern minimalist design. The public areas  are very nice and mostly open air. The room was very clean, functional and comfortable. I did not care much about the concept, meaning that you are entering your room through the window. This implicates that you have always the curtains closed. The food of the restaurant, the drinks and snacks at the bar were an…"
64,"I am disappointed with my stay at Hilton at Union Square, San Francisco.   First of all the housekeeping people took my clothes! £300 worth of menswear ( 2 x jeans Burtons navy blue and dark blue, both waist 36 and regular) also 2 x Ralph Lauren polo tops both mediums, 1 blue and 1 red.   I only just found out now when a family member emptied the suitcase.     secondly, i had nothing but bad service for your colleagues.  It seems like that no-one wants to be there. They don't understand me when i speak to them. The place is poorly hygienic. Food was below par, I had to do the WiFi payment god knows how many times.   But I am furious that I have had clothes stolen by housekeeping! I have stayed in hotels many many times. I have never had anything taken from me wherever I have…"
65,Brand new hotel located in the middle of Mall of Berlin. Perfect for shopping lovers but also for those who like central location. Underground parking available 24h for 20 euro. A lot of food points in MoB. Potsdamer Platz is just 200 m away. Gemaldegalerie is like 10 min walking.
66,"Hidden charges on the bill (not hotel taxes), then recanted on promised upgrades, and tried to recant on extended checkout. I was told that things I had in writing were ""never"" offered at that hotel until I showed them email proof...Overall, very poor service. Marriott now offers far better perks for gold and platinum members... Go Marriott instead. You will be glad you did. The hotel looked dated. Noisy. Not a great location for the cost."
67,"We stayed in the infinity suite for our honeymoon. Our ferry got there late so we didn't check in until about 8pm or later. We tried to see if we could just stay the following night instead but they said that wasn't an option and we would have to book a room if that was the case. Since this wasn't our fault, it was a huge bummer and disappointment for us. We loved the hotel and all the amenitities, would have loved to have been able to spend the day there and get our money's worth instead of just the one night just to sleep."
68,We choose this hotel for a one night stay prior to boarding a cruise ship. The hotel is situated in a good location to walk anywhere in the Waikiki area. The entrance to the lobby required that we carry our suitcases up about 14 steps from the front street. It is an older property that is reasonably clean and adequate for a one night stay but we would not choose it to stay for longer. The advantage it may have is the price point at 250.00 night Canadian at the low end of the scale for Waikiki properties.
69,"A Beautiful hotel with no complaints at all! The hotel is self is magical perfect French hotel, the staff and the service were remarkable lovely kind polite staff, who were happy to help with anything! The room was perfect, beautiful clean and cleaned Daily and complimentary items!Perfect location minutes away from République square and near metro stations! This hotel exceeded our expectations and helped make our New Years stay in Paris perfect! Could not recommend the hotel higher and we will most definitely be returning. Thank you for the wonderful stay "
70,"For business or leisure (short stay) one of the best place to stay. Clean rooms and loaded; amenities, minibar, tv channels... Good breakfast. But, there is no place to have a cup of coffee or a drink and chat with friends. Hard to get a room before 14:00 which is regular. High occupancy ratio."
71,Very nice hotel with a beautiful rooftop terrace including free snacks in the afternoon. Small but clean and space-efficient rooms. Very cold inside the rooms and the reception failed to inform me where I could find a blanket. Great location on a calm street in Barré Gotico.
72,"We recently visited Paris for a week and had the most amazing time at the Monsieur Cadet Hotel. It is centrally located, has so much around and just minutes walking to the metro. Every morning we stopped by the boulangerie next door and bought a croissant for our walk to the metro station. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful with directions and tips. The only advice I would give is bring a few bottles of water for the night, the hotel did not re-stock the water bottles in the mini fridge after we used them the first night. They added a few extra bottles of water to our bill but luckily we caught them and they were removed from the bill immediately.  The room was small but comfortable (pretty big for European standards) and the bathroom is large. Overall we had an…"
73,"I'm a big fan of Hotel Indigo properties, and overall, I enjoyed my stay at the Hotel Indigo Ku'damm in Berlin, which began as a business trip then extended for a weekend getaway.  LOCATION: The location of the hotel is perhaps the best aspect. It's in the heart of the Ku'damm shopping district, a quick walk to the best stores of Berlin (including KaDeWe), restaurants, nightlife, and public transportation, with a major subway station right outside your door. I enjoyed walking around the neighborhood day and night, even as a woman alone on a business trip.  PROPERTY: The property is bright, clean, and stylish, as expected from the brand. The lobby area is very small, and there was never anyone in the restaurant, although you don't want to bother with the hotel restaurant in…"
75,We stayed here at the end of our bike trip in the Douro Valley.  When we arrived we were greated and shown a unique but interestingly cool room.  The windows were open but it was a little warm.  During I noticed a loud water noise in the room and as it had heater up I turned on the air conditioning.  The A/C never got cold and in fact blew hot air.  Finally we turned it off and dealt with the noise and opening up the windows to try to cool down the unit.  When we complained the next morning they told us yest they knew about the problem and were getting it fixed that day.   We had prepaid the room and they offered us nothing in terms of accommodation or any help.  When you pay this much for a room I would expect everything to be working and if it was not to warn us and give us…
76,"I am here tonight and unfortunately tomorrow.  No fridge, no iron, and a tv smaller than the iPad which ""freezes"" or some such nonsense.  Front desk doesn't care.  It smells like mop water.  The river view is an alley."
77,"The surly check in at the desk, was only the beginning. Ended up in room 922 on the top floor, when we entered the room, it sounded as if there were someone in the shower in the next room, then the noise got louder. Perhaps we were situated near the compressor, but at night it sounded like a freight train was running through the room.  Unfriendly staff, and no shuttles to the airport,(as was promised on Expedia), made this way less of a bargain than first thought."
78,"I recommend all to stay in this hotel: great location, very clean, lovely staff, excellent breakfast, large rooms, restaurants down, good prices, ... 50 meters from Gare de Lyon (trains, metros, RER, buses,) + a stop for bus direct to the CDG airport   "
79,Nice three star hotel in great location. Nice staff and comfortable rooms. Only drawbacks no restaurant except breakfast room and snacks at the bar. Rooms not sound proof which causes inconvenience at night especially noise caused by landing and take off of planes in nearby airport.
80,"The location is just perfect to be while in Melbourne.  The hotel is so budget that you neither get shampoos or bath floor mat/sheet. No intercom facilities in the room.  Come out wet after the shower.  The toilet if shrunk any further,  I think would be like a doll house loo. The shower too is just a curtained enclosure... Gosh I should have added another 40$ and stayed somewhere else. The room is quite small.  Comfortable beds.  Staff are good and really helpful. That's the only saving grace for this hotel. More backpackers accommodation than a hotel.  Though it's not as cheap as a backpackers accommodation though... "
82,"The hotel was always spotlessly clean & the rooms comfortable & regularly cleaned.We were lucky to get a sea view & also a great view of the airport runway for landing/taking off.The aircraft noise didn't bother us that much but it may some people.The staff were very friendly & helpful.The downsides were the entertainment & the food which I guess is inevitable with buffet style dinner's etc.But there is no excuse for being served turkey with blood in the middle or two mega stinkey boiled eggs.We had entertainment in the ""soul & blues"" bar which would have been great but there was no soul or blues.WE had a couple of ""karioke girls"" 2 nights & a girl with a great voice singing Portugese folk songs but nobody had a clue what she was singing about.The ""Library"" had no books,the…"
83,"The staff is friendly but the hotel needs upgrading. Had problems with lock of room, it stayed opened and I happened to arrive at noon one day and found the room opened with no key.  The room is dirty, even after clean up with a wet bath tub and bathroom with hairs, even if they are mine, that should not happen at a hotel. Do not recommend. "
84,"we seek out any Adina hotel on all our trips to europe. we have found the service excellent, the location satisfactory and the appartments well designed and comfortable. as we make use of your cooking facilities we do not use the restaurant, hence we have no opinion about its quality. we highly recommend your swimming pool!"
85,Fair value comfortable clean room very close to the Gare de Lyon. All of the staff were friendly and helpful. There are many cafés and restaurants nearby and the metro is also close. My second visit here. I recommend it.!
86,"Our stay at the hotel was fine - Nothing special but not terrible. The room was clean, WiFi good, ok location and breakfast was fine.   But it is definitely overpriced for what you get. We paid just over £100 a night and it’s really not worth that at all - it’s very very basic and outdated. There were holes in the curtains, the drains smelled and the rooms feel like they need updating.   In general the staff were very friendly but the staff in the breakfast room were a little rude. We were sitting eating our breakfast when one member of staff came over with two trays and shoved them under our food without asking or saying much. When we asked him why we needed trays to eat off, he said he didn’t want to have to clean the table after us. This isn’t a problem in itself but the way…"
88,"What a disappointment. Nice enough room with NO minibar. 2 bath towels for 4 guests. 1 bar of soap needing to be shared between bath tub, shower and as hand soap. Room service did not get out order right and the food was marginal at best. The vibe in the hotel was a bit uptight and did not offer us the relaxation we had hoped for. After checking out of the St. Regis SF (which was amazing in every way!!) this hotel cannot compare to most 5 star hotels. We will not return. "
89,"Don't stay here. The cleanliness of this hotel is atrocious...I had 4 rooms because of issues with smell/stenches in the rooms, uncleanliness of the toilets and bed sheets, and noises coming from neighbors with the paper thin hotel walls. The room smells were so bad that I even had to sleep with the window open the first night in below freezing temps in Chicago in March when there was snow on the ground just to get the smell out in my third room. 3 rooms within the first 24 hours, then on day two they switched me to a 4th room, which was much better but still old and musty smelling. Stay somewhere else...you get what you pay for here, or worse...nasty."
90,"The hotel is nice with its facilities and location, but they block the deposit of 300 euro on your account when check-in, and say they refunding depends on your bank, and normally money returns in a week. Dont believe! Money returns in a week if they immediately reject the transaction, but as far as they do not do that (maybe they dont care, or maybe they do not know how to do it, or else) money stayes blocked on your card until the awaiting of confirmation of transactin is expired! So it takes about a month! Its such a bad experience I've had, my stay was nice, but when its more than a week I am back and called my bank to ask whatsup with money, it was a bad surprise to know, that my bank still has no confirmations or rejections from the apartment, so I will have to wait 3…"
91,"This is a hotel that was very nice 10-15 years ago. You can tell that it has great history but the rooms need some updating and the service was poor. We were much younger guests on our honeymoon but we definitely received poorer service. If I had to guess, it was because we were younger and seemingly didn't look like great tippers. The dining area is ok; don't spend money on meals there unless you have a rate that includes breakfast. I'm disappointed we chose this hotel but we didn't have much choice as we used a travel agency. The gym, spa, and pool were nice and Plaza San Martin is a good location. But if you think you'll be spending most of your time in Palermo, book a boutique hotel in that neighborhood for the same price as the Plaza."
92,"Had a lovely stay and enjoyed the space and hotel. Cool, calm and friendly. Breakfast outside was fab, nice jam! Very clean and well decorated. Comfortable bed. Dog was lovely too! Thanks for a great stay. We had a terrace which we used quite a bit. This is a well run home from home hotel. Small and cosy. Air con worked great! "
93,"We stayed here over a weekend at the end of May. Clearly the old palace is beautiful and has been well preserved. You really get a 'wow' effect when you come in. The staff at reception was very kind and extremely friendly and gave us a short tour upon arrival like a museum visit. Our room was spacious and stylish. The window was on the patio side so luckily it was very quiet.  Our disappointment came with the service, especially for breakfast. Maybe we were there at a special time when they were short of staff but we were very surprised that breakfast was served by the same staff from reception. I am not an expert in hospitality but clearly they are two separate functions and same staff shouldn't be doing both, no matter how small the place is (unless it is a family-run B&B,…"
94,What a treat. This is a fantastic hotel with great service and some of the best staff in the world. I always thought Asia was good but this hotel tops it all. Came with my grandkids and what a treat it was. Starting from front desk to Conciarge to bell guys to the Gym and Spa and the restaurants it was just fabulous. Thanks Peninsula we all loved it and am definitely coming back. 
95,"We booked eight nights over Christmas as Full Board for £1080 excluding flights. The hotel is on a cliff overlooking the town so the views cannot be beaten. The building is very spacious and spotlessly clean, with large bright and quiet luxury rooms with wet room etc and rooftop swimming pool and bar. Beds are firm but tolerable. There are lots of beautiful plants throughout the hotel and grounds.There is a busy road outside the windows but the double glazing is effective but you can't sleep with the windows open. Front desk team and shuttle driver are also very friendly. Unfortunately, you have to either get the free shuttle or a bus [2.40 euros] to town or a taxi [10.80 euros] but you are unlikely to return after breakfast. We made a mistake of booking full board which we did not use much as there are lots of reasonable places to eat in town. The breakfast is acceptable with lots fresh fruit, eggs, bacon etc. and, of course, the view. However, all other food in the hotel is virtually inedible. The voucher menu - ours was ""Secret Escapes"" only allows you a choice of two dishes for supper - both indescribably bad. We chose the ""a la carte"" for lunch only as this was allowable under full board. The local bread soup dish was simply bread and hot water [no relationship to the proper recipe] and a grilled cod dish was served full of bones and in a soup of oil. I was the only client in the huge restaurant on Boxing Day lunch although I gather the Christmas lunch was fully booked [we ate in town]. The grilled chicken half-board dish is two huge breasts awash with mushroom sauce and repeated is on alternate nights. I could go on about the food but others have commented already. It's a real shame because the hotel deserves to be 4 star but cannot ever be with the present catering arrangements. This despite the restaurant staff being being very nice and helpful so I guess they are embarrassed. There isn't  even coffee in the room and we got one bottle of still water on the third night which was never replaced. No telephones in the rooms either. There are no shops of any kind in the vicinity and no pavement to walk on anyway. To be fair, the spacious hotel would be a very good place to write a novel if you could stomach the food and had no interest in being a tourist. Another point to note is that we booked through Secret Escapes [which does not allow cancellations and does not respond to emails so avoid],  whereas Expedia does allow cancellations for the same hotel which is interesting. We will use Expedia on our next holiday.…"
96,"In terms of position, Le Florian Hotel is perfectly placed close to the beach, restaurants and facilities. I was working at the Palais down the road which I could walk to in 5 minutes. My room was fine relative to the cost (which was very reasonable). Best of all, the owners/staff couldn't have been more friendly or helpful which is rare and refreshing in Cannes. Don't expect expensive fancy bars and pointless spas. This is a get your head down and rest establishment with enough facilities to make your stay comfortable. Didn't want to write such a positive review as I won't get in next time."
97,Stayed at the Hilton for two nights!  Great location extremely over priced! The room was no better than a premier inn In fact the premier inn would have been better! The bathroom was dirty and really dust!  but the staff were lovely! Booked with booking.com price agreed when we arrived the hotel charged us Double the price quoted.. there are some lovely hotels locally give this a miss!
98,Beautiful hotel with great location. Staff was incredibly helpful especially the concierge and breakfast was great with wide variety of food choices. Our room was comfortable but could have been more spacious and the soundproof was not good enough. They also have this amazing rooftop bar with delicious cocktails and stunning views. Worth staying!
99,"The rooms are spacious and clean. Nice and quiet. The hotel could use a small refurbishment, more utensils in the kitchenette and a small table with 2 chairs, instead af a massive desk. Otherwise our stay was comfortable and the staff friendly."
100,"We will NEVER come back to this dump of a hotel.  Room 515 and 505 were absolutely disgusting.  For $800 a night you would think the curtains wouldn’t be falling off.  That the remote control wouldn’t be sticky.  That there wouldnt be bandaid wrappers by the bed.  But at the Eden Roc, there are!! Only half of this hotel has been upgraded, and even the upgraded half is still low end.  Walls are paper thin. Dead bugs, dust, and god only knows what else are in the corners by the mini bar in room 842.  The elevators and hallways don’t have air conditioning. Then when we tried to get someone to come get our bags so we could leave this hell hole no one answers!  Save your money and don’t bother coming here.  Can’t wait to get out of here and take a shower."
101,"From TXL airport the Vienna House is easy to get to via Bus and S Bahn in about 35 Mins. The entrance to hotel is right outside and in the middle of the road the Trams stop and whisk you to Alexanderplatz in 10 mins.   Hotel was much bigger than expected but so clean, fresh and tidy. Lifts always open and ready to whisk you off to your floor.   Rooms modern, clean and comfortable with very nice bathrooms.   Breakfast was huge and of fairly good quality. All free so can't complain.   Overall very impressed and would certainly stay again.   For 48hrs in Berlin consider the welcome to Berlin card. Saved a lot. Used public transport daily, saved at the zoo and Lindt shop. Value for money for us. "
102,"Very sad to see a company like the Sheraton, once synonymous with excellence has become the latest hotel to drop standards  I came here a year ago and the coffee was equal to the best I’d had now the coffee is some instant rubbish, this is the Sheraton but apparently that no longer means what it used to You’ve lost a customer"
103,Not Happy with accommodation room was not big enough for 3 people no where to put clothes as wardrobe was small no drawer space also single bed was Z bed had to ask for mattress also no change of linen change of towels had to be paid for  Minnie bar and safe Had to report on two occasions there was hair on my plate no apology from management also orange juice at breakfast had to be paid for staff seamed stressed I have yet to hear there voices no conversation at all On occasions lunch or dinner finished without a drink being served      Maderia is a lovely island the hotel pool area very nice and good access to beach. Bernie 11th 18th July 
104,"Nice place, nice location.  Unfortunately I did not to utilize the roof deck, it was mostly locked during the few hours I had free to check it out (early and late). Room spacious, quiet, well-equipped and bed comfortable."
105,"The stay here outperformed all my expectations. The receptionists are very kind - especially Mr. Freddy who took care of my (quite annoying) requests with generousity and kindness, and guided me about things in Berlin.  However, I think the air conditioner should be stronger - it feels quite weak."
106,"The Ibis Berlin Kurfurstendamm Hotel was a great find and good value in Berlin. It's across the street from a grocery store, and one block from the subway and famous KaDeWe Department store. The gay area is just a few blocks further.  The hotel was pretty quiet and our room was adjacent to the elevator.  Although not exactly spacious, the room was very well laid out with a comfortably sized bathroom, decent sized shower, and counter along the back that acts as a desk.  The bed was quite comfy, the lighting was good, and the staff helpful and friendly.  The window opened for fresh air, though it only opened a crack (though it looks as if it was design to swing open completely, but perhaps for safety reasons was left to only open minimally).  All in all, I would stay here again.…"
107,"I don’t know what’s happened to the W, but they used to have people working at the front desk so there were no lines, they used to have a pot of coffee to welcome guests, they used to have a newspaper in the lobby, they used to have people at the front desk who could tell you about your reservation and they used to have nice little touches to welcome guests like apples and such things.  Now, what I got, was my request for blankets ignored, no one at the front desk to find my reservation, the lines at the front desk 7 deep when I checked in with only two people working, no apples, no coffee, the wallpaper falling down alongside a dirty wall and a stain on the carpet that looked as though it should have police tape around it because it was a former murder scene."
108,"Corendon Vitaliy hotel on Jacobslaan, Amsterdam is a fairly new hotel, with a good location, close to Amsterdams GVB tram and bus stations. We had a triple sharing room and it was quite spacious. The beds were comfortable but needed better cleaning / changing of bed linen and making of the beds. The shower door was wrongly attached so getting in and out of the shower area was a  big task and they would be well advised to make changes to this. Our flight was at a later time and we had requested a slightly later check out time than normal checkout time of 12 noon. The request was denied but while seated at the reception we did hear the receptionist allowing some other guests an extended hour or 2 late check out and this made us mad. The hotel has a spa area and swimming pool and a…"
109,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel, fantastic location, delicious breakfast, friendly helpful staff.  We had a room up high that had a view in one direction of the beach and in the other of the mountains, could even leave the window open at night and listen to the waves, fantastic.  That is, until our flight was cancelled and we were required to catch an earlier one.....this involved getting up @ 3.45am, ready for a 4.30 breakfast and then off to the airport.  Breakfast consisted of us being provided with some coffee (that we had to help ourselves to) a banana and a packet of dry crackers....appalling.  The attitude of the staff member who had obviously ""drawn the short straw"" and had to get up early to ""feed the monkeys"" was terrible.  This unfortunately put a…"
110,"Hotel was dated funny smell. Carpets ripped and felt dirty. Room was small, bathroom TINY unacceptable with NO counter, pedestal sink only. Elevators small and very slow.  Could hear neighbors through the thin walls."
111,"We had a nice stay at this hotel. Clean, quiet and the staff was helpful and positive. We had some problems with getting internet access, but once it was fixed it worked fine. This is a hotel to recomend."
113,"Ribeira Brava was wonderful, providing you like to relax.There is a beach and a man made pool metres away from the hotel, along with some bars and restaurants and a large supermarket just around the corner. The hotel has a lovely sun terrace on the roof top and a small pool. Areas were kept clean and the staff were friendly. There is a free shuttle Monday to Friday once a day to Funchal. The downside was the room I was staying in , 213. It was compact, very dark and was in need of refurbishment. There was a kettle provided but this had to be placed on the floor to reach the plug socket. A fan was provided which was a nice touch. A small fridge could be supplied for 5 euros a day and a safe for 3 euros a day. There were definitely no cooking facilities in this room. The hotel is…"
117,"Booked this hotel through Accor Hotels site. Site promised amenities such as bathrobes & slippers, but neither was provided. Even though room was booked for 2, was informed at the hotel that the booking only provided breakfast for 1 - and was made to pay for the second person's breakfast. As breakfast was not particularly outstanding - we choose to dine out the next day instead. Hotel staff were blunt rather than polite - perhaps it's not their fault as we could see other customers also facing discrepancies between what is presented at the Accor Hotels site, and what actually was provided at the hotel.  Hotel facilities were otherwise satisfactory - rooms were clean and quiet.  The hotel location is near the train station and metro lines. The immediate vicinity of the hotel is…"
118,"We loved this little hotel - three minutes walk from The Opera, right in the middle of La Rambla. Great value, fresh and clean, large comfy bed and modern shower room. Everything we needed for a culture vulture three days in Barcelona. Modestly priced by Barcelona standards. "
119,"We were guests of this property for two weeks in February/March, 2012.  I see by the reviews of February 2013(especially the review by the folks from Edmonton) that things have not changed much.  The grungy, dirty rooms are still happening.  We were promised last year by the manager that things would change but obviously, they have not.  I sincerely cannot recommend this resort to anybody as our Maui holiday was spoilt last year by this property. The whole experience was a huge disappointment!  Beware if you choose to go there, we trusted that we would have a great time in a great place but it did not happen."
120,"Stayed here for a few nights to explore lisbon. The location of the hotel is great, all forms of transport are nearby, which makes travelling easy, plus you can walk to lots of local attractions as well. Lots of resaurants close by. The hotel is neat, tidy, alittle bit dark due to the theme (it its a fig based theme, which can be a bit odd!) and well looked after. The staff we friendly and helpful. However and the main reason for only 3stars, was the room. It was tidy and clean and had everything we needed but it was on the small side. Now i could have got over that but the noise level from the road and trams was unacceptable. You could feel the vibrations and felt like you were sleeping on the streets. It starts very early in the morning c6am.... Every day. I dont think the…"
121,"Perfectly located, 7min footwalk to the Beach. The rooms are small but really nice and clean. The bathroom is designed in a modern and nice style. Breakfast has a good quality, the staff is very kind and will help you with everything you need. This has been the cheapest Hotel we could find in this location including a breakfast and we were surprised what we got for that money, because we expected less. We will definitely stay here again when we‘ll visit Cannes again. Thank you for your services"
122,"Best location, nice apartment, good staff. I’ll recommend this apartment to my friends. Everything was excellent. Space of room more lager then usually in hotels of Paris. Near Opera, Lafayette, louvre, D’Orse. "
123,"As always the Best Western standard dors not disappoiint: good position beng just a minute walk far from the U2 underground station, room with large space and very clean. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel but there are several ""conditorei""  in the same street. "
125,"We stayed at this hotel from May 8-20. We booked here based on its Tripadvisor rating and reviews. It's a 2* hotel that everybody seems to love and we weren't disappointed.   All the staff are friendly and helpful. You can't walk by the check-in counter without being acknowledged with a smile and hello. Our room was small but very clean and quiet, and and the beds were very comfortable. The complimentary WIFI worked great, as did the in-room safe. Breakfast was basic (tea, coffee, orange juice, cold cereal, croissants, baguettes, butter and jams) but plenty for our liking. If you need a full breakfast in the morning there are ample eateries nearby.  The hotel's location was also excellent. The Grand Boulevard metro station was only a few minutes away, as were restaurants,…"
127,"Stayed here for two nights after a cruise from Dubai. What a wonderful place to put my feet back on land. And that's clearly what I was thinking since my only photo of the hotel is of my feet on the gorgeous floor! The rooms are lovely but highly variable in terms of layout. I stayed in room 112, which had a long entry hall, lots of closets, a bathroom separate from the bedroom, and access to a small courtyard. In contrast, room 109 is a cramped box with the bathroom sink right next to the bed. Some rooms have balconies and patios. Choose your spot before you arrive, if possible. The staff are fun, knowledgeable, and very eager to help. They give great restaurant recommendations so be sure to ask for help if you haven't mapped out a plan. The breakfast, which is served on the…"
128,Very disappointed with this hotel..Our room had very dirty windows.. inadequate coffee/milk..there was no clock radio or bedside table plus lamp on one side.we stayed 2 nights but the room wasn't made up until after 2 p.m. second day.had to complain to reception and head out for a while.I had told them we were going out and needed new towels etc.not good! The best thing about the Arrow is it's location right opposite the tram stop. I do realise it appears some major renovations happening.
129,"The position of this hotel is a little out of the way but it is in a quiet area and has good views over the valley. There is a tight narrow corner between two buildings to turn onto the road the hotel is on so a small to mid-size car is needed. The car parking area is outside the hotel grounds on the side of the road. The room we were in had a small balcony, just enough room for a couple of chairs to sit out on to look at the view. The room was a reasonable size and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was also a reasonable size and had a good shower. There was an indoor swimming pool which looked quite nice but we weren't there long enough to use it.  Hot and cold drinks were available in a communal area on the lower ground floor which is also where the residents' lounge and the dining room are situated. Breakfast was fairly basic but did include cereal, sliced bread, ham and cheese. Overall, the hotel was comfortable enough but it just felt rather soulless.…"
131,Great stay from check in to check out. Beautiful room. Good staff in total. Cocktails and food were very good. Thanks for the service to team restaurant and barmen especially Hamza. He was helpful and pays attention 👍
132,"From the photos and reviews hotel zephyr looks and sounds amazing. Hotel is very trendy and in a great area to explore san francisco unfortunately 8 couples including ourselves found the bedrooms very dirty thick with dust and debris, carpet needed a good hoover and bathroom floor needed a hot mop plys bottle caps and debris and dust all around the beds real shame but would definitly not recommend due to room cleanliness"
133,"We had a short one night stay here. The staff was absolutely wonderful, helping us know where we could find a market, restaurant, public transportation, etc.  The apartment had plenty of space and looked fresh and clean. Our only disappointment was how hard the seating and bedding was.  If only those items were addressed this place would receive a 5 rating from me. "
134,"Treated with disrespect by the staff. Not a good way to start a trip - there is no sense of customer service. While the hotel itself is quite nice, I would never be able to give this more than a poor review until they fix up the way staff treat their customers."
135,"My fiance and I stayed at the Torel Avantgarde this past April. What I can say is that the experience on the ground floor of the hotel was phenomenal - the staff was knowledgeable and helpful, breakfast was superb, design of the hotel was chic, and we were even welcomed with a glass of wine on their patio overlooking the city - amazing! Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the experience once we left the lobby. We were put in the Frank Lloyd Wright room, which in my opinion had a great number of design flaws. For example, the lamp shades over the bedside tables were so low that you couldn't fit a cup of water. The makeup mirror was clearly intended for someone six feet tall (didn't work at my 5'1"" stature). The taps for ""hot"" and ""cold"" were in opposite places at the sink…"
136,"Ok so we decided to use the public transport to get here and followed the instructions below which basically got us there, a few tiny changes would perhaps be helpful. I assumed it was tramstop number 10 but the trams don't have numbers just names.. hence confusion the stop is called ""Ten KateStraat"" when you get off cross the road and walk down the market ( at night there is no market so the road name would be useful) and then we turned right into the tramshed which had a flag with the hotel name so we assumed it was in there somewhere but it wasn't really.. back out the tram shed and continue down the road turn right and you will see it. We arrived and checked in but were told we were in a king room not a twin as they were only ""preferences"" and they couldn't offer us a twin…"
137,"Stay was OK. Rooms were dark and chilly. Didn't seem to get any brighter with lights turned on. Rooms were dirty aswell, floors were pretty worn out and AC didn't work.  Breakfast great. Lunch/dinner-service decent for the conference-part I was there on and bar were also good.   Gym was also pretty good for a hotel-gym.   Rooms 1.5 out of 5 Breakfast 4 out of 5 Lunch/dinner 3 out of 5 Gym (compared to other hotel-gyms) 4 out of 5 Bar 4 out of 5."
139,"I'm currently staying at this hotel and sorry I am.  The views are great and the location is good. The service has been ok.  But the room had problems.  On the executive floor in a ""suite"",  Number one the shower drain was not draining.  The bed was a bit too hard.  At least when you stay at a Hilton property the bed is the same worldwide. Here the bed was hard.  They brought a topper and that made it more bearable.  The Executive lounge has a nice setting and view but pales in comparison to other real 5 star hotels for variety.  It's also a rather small space and you may be forced to go up stairs to enjoy your drinks and snacks.  The morning breakfast was long on Asian items and short on  chaffing dishes of some variety of western foods.  In the cold area no smoked salmon as…"
140,I had a flight quite early in the morning and i chose this place since there was a direct bus to the airport along this route. But i just did not expect it would be so convenient!!!!  The direct shuttle to airport stops right in front of the hotel and there is a metro station (U-bahn) at about 10 mins walk. It was difficult to spot this hotel from afar since it had a narrow exposure to the main street but the morning check-out was hassle-free . The beds were comfortable but there was no free wifi. It did not matter to me since i started from the hotel about two hours before the flight and still had lots of time to kill at the airport.
141,"The location is the very best and it is good value for money when splitting the cost of the 2 bedroom apartment which has 2 en-suite bathrooms plus an additional bathroom.  However the decor is far from art ( it is gaudy), the cleaning products are highly perfume based ( which will be an issue with anyone with allergies), and there was a ceiling light in the bedrooms that was on all night and could not be turned off.  If you can live with these things then the location and cost could make it worth it "
142,"The hotel itself is in a cool area, the staff are super friendly and there's a vegetarian restaurant right in the building (and tons of other VF places within walking distance).  For a vegan travelling to Berlin, this would be a good choice.  However, it is a little bit loud with audible noise from trams, cars etc (though perhaps other rooms don't have this problem). "
143,"check-in & check-out are very messy for me that i felt unpleasant especially their staff are lack of awareness on customers' personal information (1) staff doesn't tidied customers confirmation or invoices on the desk where i had another customer check-in details right in front of me during the check-in process (2) i even got another customer's deposit credit card card holder copy attached on my invoice, just noticed when i am on my way airport....... i am now worry about if someone else got my credit card slip.... (3) a lot of people jumped in during the process asking the staff this and that without lining, and the staff won't stop them (4) the self service food counter is just at the back of the check-in counter where a lot of unknown people walking around where they can look…"
144,"We stayed for 3 nights on the 11th floor.  The room was quite dated and needed some deep cleaning.  We could see footprint  stains on the carpet all over our room.  Heard the trash trucks clanging & beeping every morning around 4 am.  The majority of the guests seemed to be Asians, maybe because Korean Air has an office of of the lobby.  The girl checking us in could barely speak English but was fluent talking to the Asian clients.  Located about a block from the beach with limited view of the ocean between the surrounding hotels."
146,"Upon arrival at Hotel Villathena we were welcomed into a modern and clean hotel by extremely friendly concierge.we were too early for the check in time, however the hotel accommodated by keeping our luggage and providing some excellent recommendations about where to go and the manner in which to see the attractions.The hotel is extremely well located, only 2 km from the train station and a few minutes walk from the center of Paris. despite the central location the hotel is not on a main road which means that the rooms are very quite in the evening.The room was much larger then we expected, which was an amazing treat. The room was clean and tidy.The bathroom was extremely clean, a major selling point . and the beds were spotless and very comfortable.I will be returning to Paris…"
147,"A luxury hotel is a place where you expect to receive excellent service, where the managers have planned ahead with their guests' needs in mind, and where your event, if you are part of a conference or wedding or other event, goes off without a hitch. But you will get little or nothing like that here.   I spent three days here over SuperBowl weekend for a business conference. Even though there were several events occurring simultaneously, the management never bothered to put all but the most cursory signage to help guests find their parties. And the staff--who were all truly pleasant and courteous at all times--still had no idea where to direct people, as management had not informed them, either. There was no concierge station at all, so there was no informed party to ask--just…"
148,"We booked this Hotel for the location, and it was a very good choice we could move easily from the Hotel to many places in Berlin. What i think was not good was the breakfast service. We could go to Brandenburg Gate walking. Therefore for location, and price a good choice"
149,"Came here with a vietnamese speaking friend and so not one word of english was spoken to me an it was as if i didn't exist. Nice rooms but from my point of view, i wouldn't return. Breakfast was vast but not if you're vegetarian. Not much to do near the hotel at night except for the night market. Beach wasn't great either as you had to avoid algae and rocks and locals. Head further south to stay for a much nicer stay and beach!! "
150," When we checked in we were waiting in line to be served for about 5 minutes and when it was our turn we were told that with the club room there is a separate and more private check in, so we took all our stuff and started over again at the next reception. This doesn't feel very premium. During check in were were asked at what time we would prefer house keeping to clean the room and do the evening turn down service. The times we we chose were not taken into consideration by the house keeping once. On the first morning at 9.30 house keeping knocked, despite the do not disturb sign being turned on. When I explained to her, that we chose a later time and knocking while the don't disturb sign is on is not very good service she looked at me, obviously not understanding what I was…"
151,"I have stayed at Park Inn Alexanderplatz several time. The location is excellent for exploring Berlin. Lots of sight nearby as well as nice restaurants. The rooms are bright, well equipped and newly renovated. This is the reason I like staying here but.... However the hotel the superlatives there is room for improvement. When staying at a superior room I expect things like coffee to be free of charge. You get a welcome coffee but have to purchase extra for 1 EUR each if you like more coffee in the room. I am a tea drinker and very quickly I got a kettle and teabags brought up. Very much appreciated. The daily cleaning of the room was not in top but to live with. Another thing is the breakfast in the Spargos restaurant. This is supposed to be for customers paying a little extra…"
152,"My parents stayed at this hotel for 3 nights last weekend - checking in on the 5th.  The accommodation costs were all paid for in Australia before leaving on their holiday.  Upon arriving at the hotel, they were told the room wasn’t ready and were offered an upgrade with a view of the Golden Gate Bridge for an additional US$40 per night.  This offer was declined ....they were given room 1272 which had a view of a roof and air conditioning units.  When they checked out they were charged $120 + tax for the upgrade, and when dad said they didn’t ask or get the upgrade, the checkout desk personnel disagreed and refused to refund their full deposit (they left a cash deposit as my dad doesn’t use credit cards)  The second rip off was - Your tour desk. They wanted to go to Alcatraz and…"
153,"We were guests at this hotel two years ago and so much enjoyed the accomodations and the friendly, very helpful staff that we decided to spend two days there earlier this month.  We found that although the rooms are still very comfortable and clean and the staff still friendly, changes in the restaurant and bar were a negative.  After a tiring trip there we asked for a cold beer in the bar and an aguardente.  There was only one type of beer--a wimpy draft Super Bock in a short, narrow glass at 3euros and no aguardente or brandy except for about two tablespoonsful of their last bottle.  We recalled a lovely restaurant with a wonderful menu from our previous stay and were looking forward to another good meal there.  It was not to be.  The restaurant is now closed for dinner and is…"
154,"This was our first visit to Amsterdam and we stayed for 3 nights. The Botel was very easy to get to from the airport as I got all the info from here as how to find it. Check in was fine, seen to straight away then down to the room. Our room was very basic but clean! I'd compare it to staying in a caravan as you heard every single noise in all the other rooms and corridor! Breakfast....don't even bother! It was absolute chaos and didn't look very appealing, we ended up going into the city the rest of our stay as we couldn't face going in there again. I'd defiantly recommend if you want a no frills stay but when you're in Amsterdam you don't sit in your hotel room all day!!"
155,"The resort it's very beautiful and the view from the houses are amazing . Me and my family travelled to Funchal for my wedding, a group of 20 people (6 children), we stayed in 3 houses.  House 39- everything was good and perfect, however rooms are quite small and the tv in the living room is very small for such a big house. The only house with TV box. Internet only works in the living room and kitchen.  No tv or internet in the rooms .  House 59,- 4/5 tv channels, quite complicated when you have children , the hot water only worked well for the first 3 people, then gets cold, heating didn't work, Internet was not good.   House 61- 4/5 tv chanels, Internet problems, heating was impossible to turn off. We paid for cleaning but the ladies don't wait, they work according to they own…"
156,"Check-in very quick and friendly staff, upgraded to a slightly bigger room. Room was lovely, very clean and modern bathroom! Location close to metro for us. Area not the greatest but with the metro everything is nearby! Enjoyed our stay and would recommend. "
158,"What I aim to do here is clearly outline why you shouldn't stay here. Upon arrival we were rudely spoken to upon check in. It felt very unwelcoming. Expect to pay $50 a day for parking whether there are spots available or not. Also expect to lug all of your luggage from where ever you were able to park your car all the way to your room all on your lonesome. Your 'high speed wi fi will not out run your pet turtle and quite frankly is useless if and when you can get your product to connect to it. (24 hours later I was able to publish this review once purchasing a SIM card). We have 2 people per room and they are a comfortable size. If you order a sofa bed though, advice is to not look in the cupboard for your sheets or pillows (apparently that's to obvious) there hidden under the…"
159,"Upn checking in to the Herbert a man walked in to the lobby and stole my luggage, after ""Claudia"" the manager assured us it would be fine and she would watch it. We were offered no discount and were stuck staying there for the night. When we called to book the room, we were told we would get discount parking and a discount at the diner next door...all were lies! There were semen splatters on the walls and carpet and the whole place was so dusty and dirty I ended up using my own sleeping bag.(I have pictures) I asked Claudia for the hotel insurance info and she refused to give it to me. She also refused to give me corporate number. They will be hearing from me in court!! Do not stay at this dump, it's disgusting!!!"
160,"Have just returned from this hotel, would recommend it for its comfort levels, however it was a little noisy at night times (noise coming from other rooms). Other than that everything was great - good size comfy bed, beautiful terrace area and perfect location! "
162,Staff are incredibly rude and uninterested in their job and just look like they don't want to be there; which makes me think why not get another job? There is no room service; which for a 4 star hotel is quite frankly unacceptable. It's a great shame that there are many things that let this hotel down and these are things that can easily be solved as the hotel is in a fantastic location. Definately won't be returning.
164,"I have stayed Vanda hotel for two nights with my girlfriend.  There are too noisy because contruction near hotel. We do not feel when we stayed here. Never come back Vanda hotel. Terrible , Terrible Service,"
165,"If you looking for a place to stay in Mendoza I understand there are really only two places to stay and Entre Cielos is one of them. First it is an acceptable hotel if you must stay somewhere in this region but nothing about it is exceptional. If anybody thinks so you are not a world traveler. It is a minimalist design, all concrete inside and out. I'm reminded of walking it's one hallway like I am in a hospital. The hotel has great views if you happen to be in half of the rooms facing the pool. The other half face an 8' barbed wire fence along a dirt road. The views of the Andes mountains is totally lost on the poor orientation of the hotel. The room is acceptable but let's get one thing straight, my one MUST HAVE in a hotel room is hot water. At Entre Cielos flip a coin, you…"
167,"If you want to stay in a hotel that is not like thousands of others hotel, this would be a great choice. They have chosen a concept that is unique for them. The rooms are dedicated to four literary couples. I stayed in the Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine room.  Arthur came to Paris in 1871, just 17 years, filled with explosive emotions. He was quickly recognised and accepted by Paris famous authors. Arthur and the 10 year older Paul fell in love and became lovers. Ups and downs. Happiness and stormy feeling. Paul had conflicted feelings towards his wife Mathilde and his lover Paul. Totally drunk he went to Bruxelles and shoot Arthur twice. Arthur survived, Paul was put two years in prison. Arthur refused to see him ever again.   But this hotel is not all about history, it is…"
168,"I really loved this hotel. The location is super convenient, near the Oberkampf metro stop which has lines 5 and 9, which goes directly to the Eiffel tower.  There are also many bakeries, cafés, and a laundromat within 5 minutes walk. The room was very comfortable and the air conditioning worked great. The street was also very quiet, so no problem getting a good nights sleep. Lastly, the staff are excellent. Special thanks to Alexandre for being so helpful. I would stay again when I come back to Paris. "
169,"The Hampton by Hilton Amsterdam/Arena Boulevard is extremely convenient being within walking distance to an outdoor mall and the area's main arena.  It is also a stones throw from a metro/train station which gives you direct access to the Schiphol Airport and downtown Amsterdam.  The staff was extremely helpful immediately responding to all our inquiries and needs.  The room was always clean, however one cleaning person forgot to restock a couple items one day.  The front desk helped us out.  Little to no heat in our room (end of December so it was a little cold), but the staff gave us a small heater which warmed the room better than most hotel room heating systems.  The bedding is standard Hampton - hard bed, lumpy pillow and short blankets.  I hope the chain adjusts these as a…"
170,"This has been our least favorite accommodation in our three weeks here in Vietnam, for a number of reasons. But first, several pros:  1. Most of the staff was nice and at least tried to help out with questions we asked of them, although English was generally limited. 2. Great location, right across the bridge from the market and close to lots of dining and drinking options. 3. Rooms were large.  Unfortunately, for us, the cons outweighed the pros here: 1. Personal preference, but this hotel just wasn't our style. Very outdated ""fancy"", with brocade furniture, dark wood, heavy drapes, etc.  2. I had an unpleasant encounter with the concierge when I approached her to ask a quick question about a food tour that we already had set up. All I wanted to ask was where we might expect to…"
171,I stayed here for 3 nights 4 days. There were a total of 3 roches in the room I did report to hotel staff but it was the day i was checking out as i have never experienced this before.  The check in staff are hit or miss. Some staff shared a lot of info about the hotel but the lady who checked me in didnt share much and I didn't know much about the property. Toilet paper rack repair was done shotty. Carpet is coming up at the bathroom door way. I know others that have stayed here and had a great experience. This might have been an isolated incident but its a visit that I will never forget.
172,"We stayed here for five nights on a first visit exploring Berlin. The hotel is in a good position very close to a transport link (these are excellent in Berlin). Also close were great places for a breakfast if you wanted to pay less than the hotel prices. Our room had everything that we needed: a very comfortable bed, chairs, great lighting, decent bathroom and it was all in an excellent state of repair and cleanliness. The staff were pleasant at all times. We would stay here again without reservation."
174,"We stayed at this hotel from for one week in August 2014 with First Choice and Thomson (TUI UK) with the all-inclusive package. On arrival (12pm) we were informed that only one room was ready and that the other room would be ready at 2pm. Rooms were to a excellent standard and had TV's which displayed a variety of local and international channels. Housekeeping's were also excellent and rooms were cleaned every afternoon (Note that mini bar is a chargeable service). Pool area was good and we were able to get 4 sunbeds everyday without any bother. Pool bar also was good and served a variety of drinks (only local alcoholic beverages included in all inclusive),ice creams and sandwiches and snacks through the day. However entertainment was a let down during the days and evenings.…"
175,Booked the Suite for one night. Bath wouldn't go any hotter than warm  -which was very disappointing because it was the main reason why we booked it! Restaurant food was no way near 4 star quality.  No 24 hours room service even though it was saying in the welcome booklet that they are open 24 hours. However the Staff was very friendly.  All in all we're disappointed - We booked this hotel only for one night because we couldn't afford to stay longer and hoped to have a great night.  We spend a lot of money and couldn't even use the bath.   
177,"Brilliant hostel - lovely rooms with nice comfy beds and plenty of space for luggage. Great evening activities in the bar, props to the barman. Good location and superb travel advice for travelling around Berlin. "
179,"I wanted to review this hotel for my blog but there was no a chance. I remember one helpful member of front desk staff this is the only positive. I spent A LOT of time researching my hotels and deciding as I write a luxe lifestyle blog. This hotel looked amazing and most important to me is cleanliness and it scored really well. After a long journey from the UK to San Fran I just desperately wanted a relaxing time. The room looked clean and nice on the face of it. It was a suite and there were champagne and chocolates. The problem was it just wasn't clean! There were stains on the small sofa but worse a black hair in the rim of the sink, I mentioned this and it was meant to have been sorted but wasn't and was still there even after the cleaner had been back in. The floor of the…"
180," Really nice apartment.  Quiet area. Plenty of free parking. Wi-Fi signal was weak but usable.  Great shower! Bed was a bit soft for my taste.  Kitchen had basic crockery,  utensils etc but bring your own washing up stuff. Only annoyance was the piped music in the lobby...Why?? Fortunately you can't hear it in the apartments!  Half an hour walk to s-bahn. Under 10 minutes' walk to a bus stop. "
181,"We stayed 5 nights here. Location though not in the heart of Paris is easily accessible via Metro within short walking distance. Room is small but comfortable and very clean. Loved that they had a Nespresso coffee machine in the room which was refilled daily. The staff is friendly and helpful, always greeting us with small chit chat. Will definitely stay here again."
183,"I booked this hotel for a staycation in the city. Everything upon checkin was fine but the room and in particular the bedding was horrible. When you lift up the blanket the underblanket was all torn up and shredded - no other way of describing it to be honest. I felt like we were in a two star motel rather than a four star hotel. I don’t know what happened but at the rates you pay for this hotel, it should not have occurred. Step up your quality please. "
184,"It was exactly what we needed, located right in the middle of the main street. Very pleased with this choice!! The only cons I can think of is the bed, it wasn't the best quality for sure, but yet- over all I still recommend this hotel "
185,"So-so room, with  window 1m away from next building's wall. Noisy AC - luckily was not needed. No breakfast. Staff was also so-so. Worst experience ever in terms of security - I never ever had someone go through my luggage before at other hotels."
186,"I was travelling solo this time, so acquired a regular room versus a triple when travelling last time with girlfriends.  Once again...great, great service from staff, one of the best locations with so many amenities outside the door (including 3 metro lines), the feel of a non-tourist neighborhood, yet, many tourist attractions within walking distance.  It was nice to have a proper separate shower with a regular room.  Not that there was anything wrong with the shower in the triple room...it was just more cramped in the triple bathroom as the shower was not separate from the rest of the bath.  Again...I would stay again and again, whether a standard or triple room...just my kind of hood, rooms are clean, nice decor, and great staff!  Merci beaucoup encore!"
187,"The good: Welcoming reception by staff; they even delivered breakfast the night before our early flight out.  Quirky and charming room. Lovely view. Well located to walk and explore everything. Quiet.  Luxury bed linens. The not so good: we were promised a king bed but got a queen (we didn't ask to switch); bedside light cord didn't reach outlet; frayed bath towels like rags; tiny plunge pool area with only four lounge chairs; helper was late on morning of early flight so we carried our own bags up -- then he appeared at the top. Generally nice place but overpriced by at least double, even compared to other places nearby. Overheard at the little bar outside reception the night before we left, ""This place is for dumb rich people."" Which we are not."
188,"This hotel is a zoo. It is expensive and provides no value for money. The service is terrible and people only help when they are tipped generously. Unfortunately, you never see a person more than once so you are having to tip constantly. The check-in is slow and ineffective. There are always long lines at the crucial times as if it is a surprise that many people are arriving. In the entire hotel, there is only one place to get coffee in the morning and unless you arrive between 6am and 7am, there is a huge line. Lines everywhere- breakfast over 30 minute wait, beach to get chairs and umbrella, food and drinks again long waits. I have never been so disappointed with a hotel in my life. There is nothing near the hotel so you have little choice but to  suck it up and wait. Never…"
190,"Awesome location very close from the train station that takes you to the airport. A few minutes away from the red light district. Staff was awesome! Loved the bar and the living room where you can relax, however the rooms are very noise. Wifi works fine."
191,"My first tome in Paris and I loved this location close to metro, cafes and restaurants with lots of happy hours near by. Oberkampf is just up the street with a lively night crowd, and hotel is a short walk to the marais. There is also an excellent spin studio kiwill next door so you don’t feel as guilty about all the food and happy hours."
192,"This is a pretentious hotel that charges extra for everything.   I would NEVER stay there again.  Staff was really not helpful.  It's old and dirty and expensive. Ever heard the expression ""putting lipstick on a pig"". This is a good example.  WiFi - extra $15 a day. Water - charged through the minibar. Staff does not feel empowered to actually do something to makes guests stay better. I paid $1200 for 3 nights for a junior suite. Lousy value."
194,"You rated this hotel as #1 in Palermo Soho & it might have been if it was in another area. Yes, it was on a tree lined street, but only that individual block. The surrounding area was in a state of flux. Some run down buildings, some boarded up & vacant & some new construction. The hotel itself was very nice & well managed but the area is not one that was complimentary to a #1 rated hotel. Nice rooms, good breakfast, clean but the overall  description was extremely misleading. Would not recommend to anyone."
195,"This Hotel is rough at best. I blew it by booking this ... and don’t know what I was thinking?  The first tell-tell sign was the front desk is behind bullet proof glass. When I went to my room it was disgusting. I’ve stayed in hotels regularly for 30 years. This place is a dump, period. I carry with me while traveling a silk sleeping insert. Even sleeping in that without using the sheet or bedspread I could smell a foulness. In the morning I went to take a shower and used my flip-flops while in the shower-tub. That’s when I looked down at the shower curtain. Bad move on my part. That’s when I got weirded out. A plastic shower curtain cost what ... $15 - 20 bucks? This thing was so old and moldy it was just gross and uncalled for. You’re probably getting a visual about now…"
196,"We stayed for one night in the beginning of december. The owner did not speak english, but that was not a problem. She was nice and helpful anyway. The room did not have a window, but overall it was quiet and nice. There was hot water and a good shower. During the night, the room got really cold and the entire tiles had condensing water on them due to the hight moisture. So everything was damp in the morning. The location is not that close to the center with approx. 25 min walking time to the railway station. Conclusion: Good for the price, but don´t expect too much comfort."
197,"This was our second stay at Hotel Taylor, it has become our go to when staying in Paris. The staff are lovely and very friendly with excellent English skills for those that are not confident with French. In our last stay we were in a superior double and this time we stayed in a normal double. Both rooms are clean, well decorated and generally wonderful; breakfast is very very nice but sometimes the hot food was slightly cold when we arrived later to breakfast.   The hotel is located near three Metro stations within a ten minute walk as well as a variety of shops, cafes and restaurants. Overall a wonderful hotel that we will absolutely stay in again!"
198,I stayed here for 4 nights great great hotel. Really love the rooms here. Clean comfortable and great location. The staff is great. Very nice. Lots of potions and make sure that everything will be ok.  Breakfast is great.  Only one issue is the heat in room. The room wasn’t hot enough and there is no option to make the room warmer.  
199,"I stayed in the hotel for 2 nights in April 2017 and was very satisfied. The room was comfortable so did was the bed in my room. The breakfast offered good variety of choices. I think that anyone can enjoy their breakfast there. The fresh juices were excellent, I can only recommend."
200,"We arrived on a hot day, the room was roasting, the air conditioning was turned off. The room overlooked a busy street. Caesar sorted it. He got us a new cool room, overlooking the courtyard and then moved us to a bigger room. He always had a friendly smile and could not be more helpful. We found a little shop for beer, ice cream and water around the corner. Even better, we found a beer Keller with hundreds of people dancing and drinking 5 minutes away on our last night. Next time we will go there first night and every night. "
201,"I made a trip to Lisbon on the occasion of my marathon with my children. The Hotel is in a great location, served by public transport, not far from the sea. The modern and functional rooms are also comfortable. the only painful note of the stay: the morning of the marathon as I had to get to the resort of departure I had to leave the hotel at 06:30 so it was not possible to have breakfast. I asked the staff if it was possible to anticipate at the same time the sporting event but I did not content myself ............. !!!!! I urge the management to be more flexible with the guests, at least when there are needs and events of an international nature, also because I was not the only athlete participating in the marathon. Thank you."
202,"I selected this hotel based on its location near my friend's apartment in the 15th and the value. It was in a quiet residential neighborhood. The staff was great and friendly, my room was cute and clean. I did not have breakfast in the hotel, in fact I would recommend  going down the street and enjoying a coffee and croissant at one of the local bakeries. I would enjoy watching the families taking their kids to school and watching residents getting to start their day. The hotel was also closely located to a grocery store which was great to grab water or a bottle of wine. Room decor was fun with the sin themes, small yet clean."
203,"Exceeded expectations, very friendly staff. Its hard to find reasonably priced accommodation in Paris, especially in this great location.  We were there with our 2 kids and we felt very welcome. Used their useful information boards at reception on how to use local transport to explore different parts of the city, and suggested itineraries. Sometimes it's that kind of information that can be difficult to find but is so useful. Would definitely return."
204,"About 10 mins from Alexanderplatz by SBahn - very modern , spacious rooms , friendly staff - try and get a room with a river view . Bar area is ok , definitely recommend sitting outside by the water if weather permits .Excellent value and a great base for exploring the city"
205,"Location, Set out of town, 5 minutes walk to beach. Lots of mosquitoes in our room and breakfast area. Wasn’t happy with our room view, no balcony. Unpleasant smell in room, cigarette smoke. Loud music playing around the pool and service very slow, 30mins to get a beer, 45mins for a bowl of fries/chips that were cold. More umbrellas around the pools are needed.  Wouldn’t stay here again."
206,"There was a mix up with the reservation dates and ended up without the room. This was at 11pm and nowhere to go. I had to pay for another room but the hotel offered nothing to resolve the issue. This was disappointing. The room was available for 1 night only and I had to find another hotel for the remainder of my stay in Salvador.  The room was OK, the view from the 7th floor was nice. The beach area didn't look great but the pool was OK. "
207,"This hotel is pretty much all about making extra money anywhere possible. You think you get a hotel right on the beach with it's own private area, but really anyone can use it and to even sit on a beach chair costs $60 per chair! If you sit in the very few pool chairs that don't cost money then you are next to Dukes which is constantly busy, and have people watching you as you sunbathe and all you hear are dishes clanging and diners chatting. The pool chairs get packed away at 3-4pm to set up tables to dine/drink at- another way to make more money. The pool is very small and always full of children. Dukes is actually a great bar but there should be some sort of priority for guests staying at the hotel. There was over an 1hr wait every night just for a table. Most of the staff…"
208,Overall very dated. Lobby stripped bare of once beautiful decorations leaving cold vacuous under utilised space. Rooms tired and not updated since 70's. In room facilities non exsistent for 4* and money paid. No kettle...no robes...no glasses...no mini bar. Only a lot of plastic wrapped disposable cups and crap coffee stuff. Terrible
210,"I can't understand how this place can survive in a city that has so many great four and five star hotels. The rooms interior is very, very dated and not well maintained - old fashioned furniture, uncomfortable sofas, electric appliances that might have been fancy in the eighties, bathroom looks really old, bathtub wasn't usable has the peg wasn't clogging.  Located in the very West of Shanghai with not much to see and do."
211,Our first stay at IBIS turned out to be better than expected given the budgetary connotation one usually associates with IBIS - The rooms were basic but catered to our need at a reasonable price. Breakfast was on till late in the morning and offered a wide variety of items to help prepare us for a long day of sight-seeing. The check-in took flat 30 seconds and the staff was courteous enough to keep enquiring about our well-being each time we reached out for a service. Highly recommended for travelers who like to experience places on their own and spend minimal time in the hotel room.
212,"Having our son and his wife living around the corner from the hotel is a plus as this is a very friendly and obliging hotel. We have stayed before and will be returning soon. Would recommend a Comfort room, the room is refreshed everyday and the bed is extremely comfortable."
214,"This has been for years one of the choices in Funchal.  Large hotel within a short walk from downtown and many good restaurants. Great location by the sea with beautiful gardens and outside pool. Excellent buffet breakfast.  The rooms are in need of renovation and update. The bathroom has this old bad smell. The wi-fi has poor coverage, the TV set is small and old with poor picture. The furniture feel old."
215,Had house centipede in bathroom as well as being double charged and the refusing to release $718 back to my account which stranded us in Iowa and they couldn’t care less. We are not the first this has happened to as per YELP
216,"The rooms were very good  however the service in the in both the lobby & roof top was poor.  Disappointingly the tea, coffee & water in the rooms wasn't replenished each day  Breakfast & room service good but bar food poor  Rooftop bar closes at 6-pm!!  Lots of construction noise from building site immediately opposite"
217,"I spend over 240 nights in Hotels in Asia per year!  I chosen the location on convenient to my agent. Not preferred at all to stay here for any other reasons.  As usual very little Englisch at the reception at check in, every time the same.  The Gold/Platin counter has no meaning  People snook in rooms, even do the hotel has a non smoking policy, the fine RMB 200 (US$31) what a joke, this does not stop the Chinese national from smoking in the rooms .   As the hotel is attached to eating places and supermarket the lobby feels like a train station  Rooms are kind of clean and the bed of relative good quality  Heating/cooling is not adjustable a set temperature and that's it, even there is a AC control, simply does not work as it is designed!  There is no culture in this hotel,…"
218,"Very friendly and courteous staff. The B&B is in a good location. Campo Pequeno bullring is across the street.  Public transportation is easily accessible from the B&B. The breakfast was okay.   Finding the place was a big problem.  There was a signage but not easily visible. Imagine coming from the airport with all your luggage and you can't find the place!! It was a nightmare!! Once you have seen the signage, you are welcomed with a lot of flies. Once we have checked in with the owner, everything went okay."
220,"Stayed in the hotel in July visiting U2 concert at Olympiastadion. The location of the hotel - although not the best - is very convenient with the U-Bahn station right across the street and another one 10-min walk away. The hotel is new, well-designed and spotlessly clean - no doubt about that. Only two downsides were the problem with the air-conditioning in the room - it was impossible to make the room cooler even though I called the reception twice. The other is some weird details with the overall very nice staff - like telling us in the evening to not to laugh in the small yard we are having drinks in because ""people are sleeping"" (although I was just sitting with my son and having calm conversation without any laughs!), and etc. Overall - very nice place to stay if you look…"
222,"Pros - nicely decorated, good location, hosts were helpful and allowed us to leave luggage before/after checking in  Cons - 1) we had a twin room and didn’t realise one bed would be elevated. My partner is scared of heights and I sleep walk so it wasn’t ideal but the real issue was how 1/3 of the bed hung over the edge (see images). Not really safe??  2) The bathroom could have been cleaner, there was mould and the toothbrush cup holder was full of hair.  3) when we checked in, the window had been left open so the room was full of flies 4) on checkout, we left our bags with them before returning later to collect. On return, we were accused of stealing the plug adapter. I wouldn’t have minded if they just asked but it was clear she didn’t believe us which made for an…"
223,"We had a 3 night stay here, and I was very impressed with the hotel. It is clean and well maintained, our room was spacious and had just enough furniture in it not to be overcrowded.  the bathroom was very clean, everything worked, and was not cramped. the only weird thing was the toilet was in the entry hall, totally separated from the bathroom.  We had tea and coffee making facilities, and there was a minibar type fridge in the wardrobe along with a a safe. the fridge was very handy as around the corner was a Monoprix where we bought milk and our own preferred tea.  The best thing of all was the large balcony with table and chairs, which we enjoyed the on several occasions.  The hotel does have breakfast facilities, which seemed good, but we did not use them as we like to get…"
224,In my 20 years of traveling I have never come across front desk staff as rude as the team at this hotel.   Zero level of urgency or follow up.   The supervisor actually said to me that he has far too many people to speak to that he doesn’t remember requests.   Would never work with this establishment again. 
225,"Clean rooms. Comfortable beds. Very nice shower. Great location. Great service. Amicable personnel. Expensive (way too expensive) parking. If you are driving, this is not the hotel for you because you will need to pay parking each day of your stay."
226,"I am staying in Marriott property around the world and had wonderful experience but The Blackstone, Autograph Collection was a nightmare for me. I visited Chicago for a businesses trip since it was a last movement plan so i could not get booking anywhere else except Blackstone. Marriott property are smoke free and its world wide and i am quit aware of that. One day i got a notice inside my room that i have been fined $250 for smoking inside my room. On my checkout i requested Reception team to recheck this notice and they refer me to the security head. I literally requested this person to waver or reduce the amount but he was so stubborn and unprofessional. I requested him that at this time i don't have money but still he didn't chance. It was such a scary moment that now days i…"
227,"Stayed 2 nights.  Staff were all professional, helpful and had good English.  Room was generous size and clean.  No in-room amenities (minibar, safe, tea/coffee).  My room had no view and only one window, but some rooms have balconies.  Air conditioning appeared to work however did not cool the room down. There are smoking floors in this hotel so be careful to specify if you want a non-smoking room.  Good WiFi. Small bar behind reception, not much of a drink selection, but at least can get a beer after walking back from the city.  Only used the dinning room for breakfast, and breakfast was excellent with full range of choices including cooked eggs etc. There is a good restaurant 20 meters across the street.  Everything else is downhill - fine if you are fit, enjoy walking, and…"
228,"Everyone associates Rio with beaches and sea. But that's not all. You can get a place encircled with swamps, where instead of seagulls you will be meeting voulters in the morning. The hotel is dusty. The carpets on rhe corridors used, with spots, smell of unclean surfaces is all the time present. It is a miracle to find a staff member who speaks English. Food all the time the same, for the evening receptions they served leftovers from the lunch, counting like for an extra dinner. Far far far away from anything, rattling busses don't want to stop for foreigners, if they finally stop, it takes 1 h to get to civilization (Ipanema). The only entertainment is visiting shopping centers, because how many car salons you can watch?  First night I had 6 bites from bed bugs, other girl…"
229,"The room was quite untidy - my friend and I found hungry jacks used sauces on the floor in the room. The bathroom also did not look like it had been cleaned properly. In regards to service, some of the workers were lovely whilst others were quite rude. We had many difficulties with the elevator and had to ask for assistance on numerous occasions. Our room was very noisy and we could hear all of the 'activities' taking place in the room next to us each night. This made my friend and I feel extremely uncomfortable and we couldn't sleep properly. Overall, I am extremely disappointed and would not stay here again. "
231,"The best thing about this hotel is the location. The location is super hip with interesting shops and restaurants. It's an upscale area. The hotel itself is hidden behind a gate and once you descent to the property, you realize that the location and views of the Lisbon from the hotel are even more spectacular. Truly amazing.  The worst thing about the hotel is that it's overpriced for what it offers. The rooms are TINY, breakfast is inadequate (both in terms of variety and quality), and quality of items found in rooms are questionable.   If you're thinking of staying at this hotel with young children, DON""T. Nothing about this hotel was created with kids in mind.   The location and views are the only thing saving this hotel. "
232,"The staff is awesome. The grounds are pretty. And the idea of having your own pool that extends from inside to outside is so cool. But for the money it really needs to be in better shape. It was dirty and needed updating! Some of that cash needs to go into upkeep i.e. deep cleaning, painting, new cushions etc. I have worked as a manager in hotels for years and this would never fly!  On our last day we got transferred to a basic room b/c we were only there half day and that was actually really nice."
233,"I went to Paris last October with my daughter and we stayed at Pavillon Nation. It was very easy to find the hotel, it is very close from metro station. The location was perfect for us. Was very quiet and safe place with everything you need near by. The receptionists were very kind and helpful, you will give you all the information that you need. The room was really beautiful and very very clean. The housekeeping did very good job! We loved the breakfast and the lady at the buffet! (was the kinder person ever) Special thanks to all the staff, we will return for sure!"
234,Cracking little hotel...nice clean rooms...friendly staff...good location just off la rambla...breakfast is adequate...free wifi works well...we will definately stay here again...we really enjoying our stay😆😎
235,"First off, I apologize to the readers for this very long review, but the details below are necessary. PLEASE READ IN ENTIRETY IF YOU PLAN TO STAY here and want basics such as a working shower, TV or room with quality climate control.  OUR STORY: My wife and I were really excited when we booked our stay at the Ivy Boutique Hotel, looking forward to celebrating our anniversary at what looked to be a very promising hotel. We had researched the hotel here at Trip Advisor and read the positive reviews. The reviews compared to or exceeded the Fairmont, Swissotel, Westin Mich Ave, Palmer House and other places we've stayed at in Chicago, so we were really excited. The location appeared awesome (it was) and the hotel being new, but open over a month, made us think the hotel would be in…"
236,"They remodeled the lobby, but as soon as you get in the elevator you realize this place is old and run down.  The decor is not only shabby and worn, it is dated and kitsch.  Tacky is probably a better word.  Many things did not work in the room. Lights would not come on. Furniture was beat up. Dark colors made the place depressing.  To make our experience even worse, the experience with breakfast was a little taste of Hell on Earth.  Extremely slooowwww service and lousy food. The worst staff I have ever seen anywhere. TERRIBLE!!!!  I will NEVER go back here with all the other great hotels in Chicago.  Save yourself from a miserable experience."
237,"The Hotel de l'Horloge is quiet, clean, great character and secure. The service was very quick, helpful and polite. It is located in a great area with lots of bars, restaurants and public transport close by."
239,"Just joined Accorhotel member and thought i would plan my Europe holiday with accorhotel.  But after staying in sofitel hyland shanghai. Im having 2nd thoughts. This Sofitel is totally not the usual ""sofitel standard""! Location is the ONLY advantage i could think of. Whole hotel was old and much needed refurbishing. Booked thru Accorhotel website and stated clearly in the booking that our rooms were entitled to ""free high tea"". After reaching the hotel, staffs were unknown about this ""promotion"" and referred us to the club floor. After reaching the club floor, seems like no staffs were ""aware"" of such ""promotion"" and insisted that it was stated in their system that our bookings was a NORMAL booking. Seriously accorhotel???!  "
240,"I found this hotel very disappointing. The wifi is abominable, wherever you go in the hotel. I asked at reception if there was any particular part of the hotel where I might get a better connection and they simply said 'no'.  The food was very poor indeed.  And some of the staff were either unhelpful and uncommunicative or actually rude."
241,"If you're looking for a hotel that's dead center of Union Square, this will be the perfect hotel for you.    If you're looking for a hotel that's clean, look somewhere else.  I arrived at the Westin and checked in without any problems.  I was really looking forward to the stay an excited to be so close to Union Square.  I had prepaid and secured a 1 bedroom suite with a connecting single room for my family the trip.    We headed up to the room and immediately, my wife and I both started getting headaches as the room smelled of stale cigarettes.  After we entered the room, we noticed a huge stain in the middle of the floor.  Travelling with two toddlers, I did not want them on the ground in this room.    I headed back down to the front desk to resolve the matter.  I was told that…"
242,"This has quickly become our favourite hotel in Paris.  My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights over a very cold February weekend.  We loved everything about the hotel -  the location, the rooms, the staff.  Our room was large (especially by Paris standards), well designed and furnished.  The bed was the most comfortable bed we have ever slept in!  The attention to detail is superb.  For example, the bathroom is actually designed with flat storage space for toiletry bags and has a wonderful make-up mirror.  The bathrobes are lightweight, long length and fabulously soft and cozy.  Small details perhaps, but indicative of the care and attention we experienced.  The staff were very helpful and there was always someone on duty who spoke English.  We also appreciated the fact that…"
243,"Our second time in this hotel, amazing service, well located, comfortable, clean, the perfect way to visit Berlin. The location is great for shopping, public transport or sightseeing, both times the room was very comfortable and modern, with all the amenities you might need, the bathroom was clean and had a very good shower. Breakfast is an excellent buffet, good quality and includes a good choice of organic items. Such a good value- all you could ask for in the center of the city. Will be our choice every time we come to Berlin for sure :)"
244,"Stayed at this hotel 3 days. I almost wanted to give this hotel 4 stars, but one thing was not ok. The room was really good, and the service nothing to complain about. The breakfast quite okay. But the food (buffet) In the evening was below what you could expect from a 4 star hotel. Because of the evening food, I only rate my visit 3 stars instead of 4. "
245,Great location. Nice breakfast place. But what matters is the room. No coffee maker. No water. And a really tiny bathroom. But what really ticked me off was the bathroom drain. Clogged. I had to shower in 6 inches of water. 
246,If there was a score of good then I would have given that rating rather than average but in all honesty I can't give it very good.   There are a number of pluses. The main ones are the location and the staff of the hotel. There are lots of bars and restaurants near by which are excellent and not too pricey. It's about a 30 minute walk into the centre of Funchal.  The staff are very friendly and are an asset to the hotel. They are very friendly and helpful. Always have a smile on their faces even when it was very busy at breakfast.  Plenty of sun beds.   The down side.  Pillows were very lumpy and uncomfortable  Bed was also uncomfortable  Drink prices in the bars were excessive especially give there is a bar 100 feet away where drinks are less than half the price of the hotel.  Food on occasion on the breakfast buffet was warm rather than hot.  Shower power was weak  It's a shame as I would like to go back due to the staff and location but will look around before booking here again.   Please take note of the comments as they are not the first time that they have been made. …
249,"As a SPG Gold Member, I always tried to stay with SPG whenever possible. For a short urban retreat during CNY, it’s not a bad idea to stay one night and enjoy the hotel facilities. I chose the executive room rather than a standard room so that we can ‘enjoy’ the club lounge usually served with nice canapés, wines and decent range of beverages.   I was a bit surprised when the lady checked us in told us to go to the lobby restaurant for breakfast instead when I asked. We checked in the room and the size is spacious although details and toiletries are not up to the usual St Regis standard. Then, we went to the ‘club lounge’ and found that no canapés and sparkling wine were served because of CNY. Btw, the only white wine available is chilled but soured. So why should people pay at…"
250,"This is the second Ayre Hotel I stayed in in Barcelona.  We chose this one so that we could be close to the cathedral.  It is also close to a subway stop, restaurants, and other things.  This is a very modern place, and very clean.  "
251,"I booked a twin room for me & my wife as there was no doubles available, when we arrived and went to our room we realised what we was in for, There was a single bunk bed for me and my wife so we went straight back down to reception and said that's booking.com said that we was getting to single beds so we was just going to push the beds together we was then told that the hotel doesn't even have single beds only doubles and bunks, the room was painted grey the floor was grey and the bunk bed was grey it was like being in a prison cell not the sort of place you want to take your Wife for a pre wedding anniversary and birthday weekend, to make matters worse there is no screen door on the shower so you have to put a towel on the floor leading in to the bedroom but this doesn't really…"
252,"If you want a clean, reasonably priced hotel with a great location, look no further.  This is it.  Newly remodeled in a modern style, the place is spotless.  Staff speaks English fluently and was attentive.  And the price was great!"
253,"Glass door to bathroom, although frosted between knee and shoulder height, left no privacy. Both my partner and myself felt very uncomfortable using the facilities and this is the main reason I would not stay again. Staff were ok but could not be described as being friendly and welcoming.  Great location however. Bed comfortable, quiet air con and great black out curtains made for a great nights sleep. "
254,"We were not impressed with the Tivoli Hotel, too many lifts and stairs and long corridors to get to bedrooms. Very confusing. I dont know how anyone with a drink would find their way around The Breakfast each morning, when we finally found  the dining room ws excellent. The only thing that was good about the hotel"
255,"This is a average hotel, not what you would expect from this brand.  Hotel is overcrowded, rooms are tiny.  Only about half of the staff,  smiled and said hello.  Unfortunately nothing stood out as being exceptional here, it was just average.   Close to the beach, restaurants and nightlife.  "
256,Centrally situated smart lobby .House keeping poor insufficient tea bags no milk cartons in room .No hot water for the first 24 hours .Breakfast so so in an over crowded room where we were invited to share a table with other guests .Not nearly 5 star and there are many better nearby alternatives for less money .Front of house staff friendly .
257,Im sure the staff could have looked into my complaint and rectified the issue.  But nothing was done for 2 nights.  When l wanted to extend for 3rd night l told the reception staff unless they change my room I won't extend.  Finally got another room @ 522. Thanks for the change! Compliments to yr male staff I can't remember his name.
258,"Stayed at his hotel mid February. The weather was mostly lousy, but we enjoyed the location close to the sights. The hotel was quiet, I subscribe this to the low season throughout the country. The staff was helpful and offered assistance. The rooms were spacious and the ceiling to floor windows created a lovely openness. The breakfast was top class, the quality, preparation and variety was impressive as much as it was enjoyable.   The hotel, ultra modern with an abundance of black, however did not grab me...no atmosphere and little soul. The black stoneware, always beautiful when new, showed signs of wear. This is evident in the passage ways and bathroom. Talking about bathroom, here modern design outweighed functionality. The spa area / pool was beautiful but I found it hugely…"
259,"I stayed in Stayokay based in what people said about the place. Well, I expected more. Actually, there are good things, but others very bad. The staff is kind and helpful and there's a place to put your bike inside the building, and that is great once it's not unusual the bikes be stolen. The location is also very good. The lockers are located outside the rooms, which is good 'cause you can make some noise without disturbing anyone. However, you must have your own padlock, otherwise you'll have to buy one at the reception (5€, there's no rental  option) or outside. I chose the second option and paid 2€ for a padlock. There are no paper towels in the bathroom, so you must keep your towel with you. The worst thing for me was that there is no wall socket near the bed, or even in…"
260,"As well, but more mature travellers my wife and I were a little hesitant in our choice of this hotel but we need not have worried,. We can only agree with all of the positive comments of other people. The room, the  location,the breakfast and the staff were superb for the price paid.Thank uoi"
261,"We stayed at this hotel over Christmas. Our first week was ok the rooms are big the beds are lovely and comfortable although i had to ring reception for the sheets to be changed after 1 week. Everything is new. However when the hotel had about 500 people in it over the Christmas period they ran out of sunbeds you only got one if you got up at 6.00am they did not have enough tables and chairs they had to bring some out of the business centre. They only have two all inclusive eating areas the buffet kitchen and the shack these got very busy and noisy so we ended up eating out which we didn,t expect to have to do on an all inclusive package. We also got home with tummy bugs my daughter was quite seriously ill, we feel because corners were being cut due to under staffing. Its a…"
262,"We had a two-family trip to Lisboa in November -16 and stayed for 6 nights in Sana Reno Hotel. Our experience was really good: the hotel is clean, rooms are spacious and modern and the breakfast was ok. The service was good. It was a pity that the pool was not heated, it would have been nice to have a swim after a long walk in the town! Despite of the cold water, few of us very brave enough to have a swim or two. However, the pool was not very clean :(. All in all, I can recommend the hotel: it is right next to the tube station so moving around is very easy!"
263,"Quite a nice hotel in the very hart of Berlin. Just two minutes to walk to Ku'dam shopping street and five min. walk to restaurant's area. Rooms are ok, normal size and clean, amenities work properly.  Staff is friendly and qualified. Breakfast is good for that kind of hotel range.  Only cons: no gym, and just a soap dispenser in the bathroom. No shampoo, conditioner, or body lotion. Safe in the room to small to fit medium size laptop.  All in all good hotel. Will recommend for business travelers especially."
264,"Rooms lovely and clean with great facilities, fridge (complimentary water and soft drinks) USB charging point. As per another review staff are definitely 5 star plus particularly Cristal who made our stay in Paris fantastic, wish we could have stayed longer but they were fully booked. Although the standard rooms may be small they are well designed so wasn't a problem for us and it is Paris so didn't spend much time in our room. It was a heat wave when we were there and the aircon worked very well and was the quietest I have experienced in any hotel and I travel a lot for work. This hotel will definitely be our first choice in Paris and would recommend without hesitation."
266,"Very friendly staff, our flat was clean, well preparred,no probelms at all during the stay. Kitchen well equiped, no hiden fees. You can leave the baby trolley or bikes in the back yard, without necessity to use stairs. Very quiet district in close distance to trams and subway. In the front of the house there is a nice cafe. Surronding is very nice, typical Berlin atmopsfere. There is a bike renal neraby, as well as shops, supermarket and cafes. Nearest metro in Rozenthal Platz. I recomend this place to everyone.Michal/Poland"
267,"Fantastic location, friendly staff, great little breakfast and nice rooms. Highly recommend for a stay in Paris, within walking distance of so many must see places to visit. And if you like shopping you will be in heaven aswell."
268,"Not a business hotel. There is a table tennis table on the foyer. It's like staying in the Linton travel tavern.  Cheap finishes, service befitting a casino Customer service. Ie anything is fine if it suits the house.  Until it doesn't suit the house then  customer service be damned!  If you get it cheap and need a bed then fine. But if you are paying average rates as a business customer there are plenty at the price point that are way better"
270,"I made a reservation at Westin Chicago River North for one night to attend a conference.  I never received a written or email confirmation so I called and received a verbal confirmation.  When I arrived, I learned that my reservation had been entered for the wrong date, for the wrong duration, and with the wrong email address.  My room was not available and I lodged at the much nicer and less expensive Hotel Sax across the street (5 stars for Hotel Sax - go there!  They gave me a river view, treated me as though I were important to them, and charged me just over HALF what Westin charged me for...NOTHING!)  I got home and found I had been charged for the room night.  I sent repeated emails asking for a response and got nothing.  When the event manager finally contacted them, I…"
271,"Ibis have a fine selection in Berlin.  Usually I go for one of the cheapies near Alexanderplatz but this time we had a really early train from Hbf so booked this hotel.  5 minutes walk from the platform so ideal.  Advance checkin and checkout, fine room / bathroom, had to leave too early for breakfast but the restaurant looked inviting.    This is a well designed modern hotel with friendly helpful staff and a location that invites you (well it invited us) to stroll along the Reichstagufer on a hot summer's evening en route to Friedrichstrasse.  And then to stroll back along the opposite bank.    It's a definite step up in quality from my old Alexanderplarz favourites so I may revisit even without the early norning getaway reason ...."
272,"Hotel Großer Kurfürst is situated next to the Märkisches Museum of Berlin history. From here U Bahn trains (underground) and  a lot of buslines are right in front of the door. So you can easily visit the whole city.  Parts of the Centre, like Unter den Linden and the Stadtschloss and the Nikolaiviertel can be visited on foot. The hotel offers good rooms and a pleasant service. As it is not on a busy road you can sleep well here."
273,"This hotel at 500+ per night is no a luxury hotel, in fact it’s nothing more than a Hampton Inn or Comfort Inn at best.  Pro 1. Decent furniture 2. Ok location   Cons 1. Over priced (500+/ night) 2. No executive lounge 3. Amenities don’t always work 4. 15 dollar credit daily for food and the restaurants barely had stuff for 15 dollars 5. Over hyped roof top bar 6. Customer service sucked 7. Very, very small rooms. "
274,"I just spent 3 nights at this hotel with a friend. We had two different rooms and each of us had disappointing experiences.   I had such high expectations for this property, great reviews online and the hotel was highly recommended by our travel agent.   The good - great location, cute modern rooms.   The bad:  The whole check in process was a bit unprofessional. The check in desk was quite small and very crowded with guests arriving and departing and the staff seemed a bit confused. We were shown to our rooms by one of the male staff members. We each had one large suitcase and a small carryon bag. No one offered to help us with our bags, in fact the gentleman seemed frustrated that we were having difficulty maneuvering our bags into the small elevator, but did not once lift a…"
275,"Beautiful and convenient location close to Central Station.  Very pleasant staff and a good healthy breakfast.  We arrived in a freak Sept. heat wave.  Hotel is not air conditioned. Fortunately it is an old house and we were on the first floor.  The room is quiet, oddly furnished and quite spacious but not very comfortable and perhaps better suited for a younger couple."
276,"After coming from very centralized Airbnb locales but paying an arm and a leg and getting some sketchy residences, coming to this hotel was like an oasis in the desert. First the manager of the hotel reached out a week ahead with a survey to make sure all our needs are setup beforehand. On arrival the front desk was courteous, and with no lift, helped us up to suite 2 with our luggage. The hotel had a boutique feel to it but Parisian, modern and newer feel to it. The room was more of a family suite, with a nice queen sized bed, with a living room area with a sofa bed. There were also 2 TVs, one being freaking huge though I could only get 4-5 channels on there. The bathroom was stocked with L’Occitane products and there was a mini-kitchen with a fridge. The entire unit was…"
278,"The hotel is very comfortable! It was comfortable for a family of four, although the kitchen and the bathroom were a little small. The dryer machine seemed to have a problem, but we were trying to use it on our last night and had no time to ask for assistance.   The location is great! Right across from La Pedrera!"
279,"Very disappointed, since I was traveling for job reasons, I had three packages delivered by Amazon to the hotel and was charged 5 dolars service for each package received by the hotel. I travel a lot due to business reasons and this is the first time I am asked to pay this ridiculous high rate by a hotel per package received."
280,"Location is incredible. You are IN the old castle so that's amazing. There are several different buildings so if you have breakfast included, make sure you are in the building with the restaurant; otherwise it's a LONG way. Rooms are old, expectedly and that's ok. But you can hear every word of your neighbors; every toilet flush and worst of all, every step of the people above you. As it turns out, there are a lot of hotels in the exact same area, so it's worth looking at others."
282,"Good hotel but people at the reception are not very friendly and hardly speak English (one person kept talking to me in German while I was speaking English). The room was small, but very comfortable and clean. A lot of choice for breakfast, even gluten free products. "
283,"Look this hostel advertisers' itself as being the worst, but its clean and in a good location, really cheap prices and a very social situation at and around the bar. Drinks were cheap, there were fun games and it was just a good place to be if you want to meet new people whilst also walk around Lisbon"
284,"Travelling as diamond members? Don’t bother.  Check in agent miserable until he clocked the diamond status and then seemed to have personality transplant within 5 seconds, cue fake politeness. Diamond cue was ignored for breakfast on 30/08.. for me and many other diamond guests. The female host blatantly ignored us and seated the other line. When questioned, she made up some excuse about seating a group - which was nonsense as the entire 10-15 minutes we were standing there the  individuals seated were quite clearly random guests. Along came a male host which was much more attentive, just wish we had got him as our experience was already tainted.    "
285,"Great Hotel, fantastic area if you want to go and see all the major landmarks and plenty of bars and restaurants. Staff are excellent and can't do enough. Hotel is very clean.  Only thing that stopped me giving it a 5/5 was the TV in the room there was only 1 English speaking channel which was CNN International. Considering there are 90 channels would look to have a couple more when chilling out in the hotel   Other than this can't fault the hotel at all"
286,"Loved it, breakfast restaurant nice. Room shaby but clean. I am a Novotel person so I lived it. It is 15 minutes walk frI’m Alexander platz and the tower. I love Berlin it is a vibe city. There is a supermarket down there where you can buy some good food stuff. And just behind the hotel there is a metro station which makes it very easy to reach anywhere in Berlin. In fact this hotel is located in the former eastern side of Berlin, very nice on I recommend it to those who like to see historical locations"
287,"The hotel is very easy to find and the staff welcoming at all times. We managed to get our room early as it was ready when we got there. The hotal was completely refurbished a couple of months ago and the result is great. The room was clean and very nicely decorated, breakfast was amazing. I would defo return myself and also recommend this hotel to others. "
288,"We stayed 3 nights in this hotel. It is situated in a central position, but is a very, very old building. We had a 2 double bed room. The room was clean, but very small. The door to the tiny bathroom, when opened, hit the tv on the wall. Plus the door to the wardrobe could not be fully opened without it scraping across the end of the bed. The water from the shower took several minutes to heat up and then would go cold then hot. Sometimes it stayed cold. We had 2 cold showers. There is no concierge service. No help with bags. The valet parking was $45 per night. The room was hot. There was a ceiling fan, but it was noisy so we did not have it on when we slept. Plus, we could not leave the window open as the loud city noise came into the room. Finally, there was a mix up with our…"
289,"If hipster means no manner, the staff there must be the greatest hipsters. I didn't want to use any big words, but one of the staff there was the biggest racist I've ever met (didn't happen to myself but happened to observe that). If you failed to find a place to live early enough and don't mind the rudness, I would recommend Holliday Jones."
290,"This was our 2nd stay at Hotel Philies.  First time was March 2016 with my husband and this most recent stays was to bring our family (3 adult childrent) for a European trip.  We chose Phileas due to it's close location to Gare St. Lazare as we were travelling to Bayeux/Normandy the following day.  We booked the family room (1 king + 1 single bed adjoined to another King room).  The rooms were huge for a European hotel and we were very comfortable.  Our rate included breakfast which began at 7am.  However, we had an early train to catch and to our surprise, breakfast was about ready when we came down at 6:30am.  Rooms are clean and comfortable.  You are right next to train station so there is a little bit of noise but nothing that kept us from sleeping.  Staff are…"
291,"We had a very enjoyable stay once we got into the right room!  We had booked a 'Classic Sea View' room in 8 months before our stay.    When we arrived, we were put in a very small room next to the public promenade (a Promenade View room).  While the room was well appointed for its size, the balcony had metal shutters, which when viewed from outside looked more like a prison cell than a hotel room!  The small balcony was right next the public promenade - and we didn't feel it was usable because members of the public walk past just a few feet away.  The hotel didn't tell us that we had been downgraded, but we worked it out for ourselves after viewing the Pestana web site.  Cutting a long story short, we moved the next day into a Classic Sea View room having negotiated some…"
292,Fantastic location and close to all the amenities that you will require. The apartments are of a good size and very well equipped. Easily accessible from the airport with public transport or if you are taking a taxi the cost is around €42. The only downside side to our stay was the noise from the street below. We were in a room looking onto the front entrance. This meant we were aware of the noise from the street and sleep was interrupted most nights. The noise however wouldn’t put me off recommending these apartments or from staying here again.
293,"My colleagues and I, have been staying in this hotel for about 3nights. The hotel is good for business trips and not for family or especially friends as too many conferences are going on in this hotel. The internet is good. Staff are friendly and helpful. Although this hotel is pretty big but you see too many people going around. The breakfast is limited in choices. The location is good, only 10 mins to mall of berlin and sony center. "
294,Poorly maintained room . .....Just big name. ....Avoid going to Lalit Jaipur.... Much better placed are there in and around Jaipurfor lesser cost. Poor room service and cleaning tooo.. they are there to just make some extra bucks from who ever visit. In this era WiFi services too extremely poor.. think so they require to update themselves in all aspects
295,The hotel is very old but with a nice view of Waikiki beach just in front of the hotel. The room is very small and also the shower. There is only one elevator and can only accommodate few people at a time. Parking fee is $22/day and resort fee $20/day. Extra $10 charge per day for partial ocean view.
296,This was a great hotel in a great location. Safe parking. Beds were comfortable. The room was just as pictured and air conditioning works great. I would stay there again anytime. Excellent service and quality at an awesome price.
297,"Rooms are modern and nice, but lack facilities. Sauna and jacuzzi were nice but not always open. Too laid back approach of staff, for price paid staff should be attentive and cater to your needs. The location is nice and flat. The island is beautiful with some very nice restaurants but don’t eat at the hotel, food not to the standard you would expect from a 4*."
298,No one there deserves a job! They could care less. Bartenders valet and bell men are insanely rude!!! I travel everywhere the hotel was nice but room smelt like smoke terrible. I’ve never wrote a bad review but this place has it coming.... terrible
299,Room had stained carpets and shower door did not close completely.  Breakfast very minimal.  Furniture in room was not very comfortable.  Bed was ok.  No in-house restaurant.  Shopping mall about two blocks away.  Family Mart nearby for convenience items.  Desk staff friendly and English no problem. Probably will seek different accommodations next time.  Hotel rooms need updating.
300,"My husband and I always prefer small boutique hotels when traveling. Prior to arriving at the Miravida Soho we had stayed in 4 boutique hotels on this trip to So. America. We were also traveling with another couple. We planned to stay 3 nights, relax and be well rested for our strenuous hiking in Patagonia, the next leg of our trip.  The Pro’s of this Hotel: Friendly staff and great location.  Con’s: I walked into our room and a cockroach was scurrying on the floor. I thought, “not happy but old hotel, this can happen.”  I told Roxanne discreetly and she seemed genuinely sorry but not surprised. I suggested she send up housekeeping but she said no, they will fumigate the room tomorrow. I didn’t like the idea of sleeping in a room that was going to be “fumigated”.  The pillows…"
301,"I stayed this hotel only one night, but I wanted to stay more days.  The room was comfortable and lovely interior. It was calm outside, and I slept well. Breakfast was enough. I will stay here if return Paris."
303,"  Dates of stay :  from 06/05/2015 to 08/05/2015 ,  i.e. 2 night(s)   i have been travel for my business trip on the above date and make a reservation before flight over.  However the moment i reached but be informed by the hotel receptionist that there was no room available. (1st disappointed)  For this trip, total 2 rooms are booked. One of my partner who reached earlier have been told the hotel that i will check in late because of the late flight but when the moment i reached hotel and proceed to check in they mentioned my partner did not tell them. (2nd disappointing on the blaming attitude)  i decided to choose this hotel is because it good services i had experienced during my last business trip but not this time.  Regards, Caron Tang    "
304,"Had beautiful lunch in this Hotel, surroundings amazing as was view, food was excellent although my favourite was Camembert/starter deep fried with orange slices and tasty jus. Excellent lunch would recommend."
305,"I've stayed at this hotel several times with small groups of travelers on my Artistic Adventures. it never fails to offer what most travelers needs in Paris: clean, stylish little rooms with good bedding and fantastic help at the front desk; all in a safe Parisian neighborhood. You're out of the tourist mania of the Marais and Latin quarter. Nation station, a main metro hub, is a 10 minute walk. Gare de Lyon and Bercy are closely. A wealth of lovely local restaurants are within walking distance, too. The open air market is Wednesday mornings at Nations, to boot."
307,"We spent there 3 nights. After having read in the reviews about problems with wi-fi, I was pleasantly surprised that this problem was fixed. The only minor drawback was that you had to renew it every 24 hours, and it took some time to get over the procedure.  The hotel is situated at a walking distance to the centre, underground station and many other places you might want to visit. You may buy the 24 hour ticket for the public transport at the lobby, which is very convenient if you want to reach some more remote places, 6,7 €. The room had everything you need, though without excess. There was a fridge in the room, but no mini-bar, yet all you need is lift up a phone, and you could get anything you needed. There was a possibility to make your tea or coffee if you wished. The…"
308,"The hotel was not bad for the price. A bit tatty and shabby. The breakfast however was dreadful. Was like a feeding frenzy at the zoo. The food awful with ghastly cold scrambled egg and nasty cheap sausages. The fruit was all tinned fruit. Nothing fresh. The juices were so watered down, it may as well have been water. "
309,"I have stayer here several times. The staff is friendly. The rooms fine. I was going to let this issue pass but the more I think about it the more it irritates me. I stayed here in January. The toilet wouldn't flush. I let them know when I went out the next morning and when I came back later in the day the toilet still wouldn't flush. They sent somebody up who could not fix it. I was leaving early the next morning and it was 9:30 pm and I didn't want to change rooms,. So I had to use the bathroom in the lobby,. I stayed in a room two nights with a toilet that did not work and they made no apology or adjustment in my rate. I wrote the management twice and have not received the courtesy of a response. So be warned. The management doesn't care and won't fix a problem and all you'll…"
310,"First of all - this hotel is fantastic as a hotel. It's modern, perfectly located, clean and stylish and on that front you cannot fault it. Rooftop pool, use of the SLS's gym and a funky little restaurant on the ground floor, what more could you ask for?  I paid in full at the time of booking well in advance, but the hotel took $60 resort fees out of my account on 4 separate occasions just a month before we were due to arrive. Trying to get this money back was a chore, and just as one refund went through, low and behold the charge came out again. After a fortnight of back and forth and around a dozen emails, my resort fee was refunded in full as a gesture of goodwill. The end, right? No. No record of this on file, so had to have the same argument AGAIN upon checkout to get this…"
311,"I'm an American Express platinum cardholder who has stayed at over 30 AMEX Fine Hotels & Resorts (FHR) properties throughout the world. Of those 30+ properties, the Huntington is unquestionably the least deserving of FHR designation.   The facilities throughout the hotel feel incredibly dated and unclean. Because we booked through American Express we were automatically upgraded into a ""junior suite"" upon checkin—but the suite felt like it hadn't been updated in 20 years, and there were scuffs/marks/dents throughout the room. The ""gym"" is a room the size of a walk-in closet, containing one bench, one weight rack, and one machine. We found the ""gym"" so amusing we decided to take a peak in the ""gym"" shower—where we found hairs and dead bugs on the floor, clearly indicating that…"
312,"The phrase that comes to mind with this hotel is you get what you pay for. The welcome from Pierro and his pug couldn't have been better, he provided us with a map detailing all the best places to visit in Amsterdam and how to get there. Our room was situated on the top floor, this was a tricky climb after a few beers! The stairs and landing were under restoration when we arrived. The room itself was very basic, but adequate for what we needed. There were a few things wrong with the room, such as the plug sockets being slightly unsafe, the TV didn't work, and neither did the bedside light. The room also got very cold at night as the heating was very intermittent! However as we weren't spending much time there this really didn't phase us, and for the price we paid, we couldn't…"
313,"A very nice hotel, the excellent helpful staff  at reception and bar. Rooms well appointed, airy and bright. Close to the underground.Walking distance to the river and other attractions.Handy mobile phone with a map app for attractions, hotel sightseeing etc.   We would certainly stay again."
314,"We arrived yesterday evening for the last leg of our road trip. The person who checked us in at the front desk was extremely rude & unwelcoming. I would have thought a hotel of this standard would train it’s staff to welcome its guests in a pleasant friendly & helpful manner. She didn’t ask us one question, for example - did we have a good journey, where had we come from, would we like any information about the hotel & the city etc?. We have stayed in hotels all around the world but have never been greeted in this manner. She didn’t even tell us which floor we were on or how to get to it when she grudgingly gave us our room key! During this time she took a phone call while she should have been attending to us - the height of rudeness. As we left the desk some more guests were…"
316,just came back from a holiday here. The room is spacious and the infinity Pool fantastic they are the only good points. The foyer is not air conditioned the main eating area is not air conditioned. The food was cold at breakfast although the range was good. the temperature in Vietnam at this time of the year is hot so I did not find this place comfortable unless you wanted to stay in your room or go to the casino at night. The front desk is a great walk to the lifts and so if you need something may take some time to get too. This place was not great to stay at. On a happy note the pools are amazing and the beach and activities were well catered for. it is such a shame the size has made such a difference to the quality of the area inside.
317,"Our deluxe room was very comfortable and immaculately clean. Staff were efficient, polite and attentive. This is a lively area of Paris with some great restaurants!We will definitely return in the future!"
318,Wifi doesn't work in the rooms (when I complained I was told it's because it can't handle more than 10 connections at a time. What kind of explanation is that for a hotel with a capacity of art least 70-80 people?!) Location is a bit shady as well at night as it's not in the city center or old town area. Disappointed overall
321,The hotel internet blocks third party apps such as Viber and VPN. This is the only hotel I stay at in Shanghai that does this. Marriott and Renaissance do not do it. I don't get why they feel the need to censor internet communication as a hotel.
322,"Location is great! Front desk and breakfast staff are very professional and helpful. Rooms are very small (borderline claustrophobic); Noise level in hallway floors (due to very unconsidered guests) made it almost impossible for a good night of sleep. Elevators in the morning were almost everyday locked by the cleaning staff... as a result most everyone had to use the stairs, which added to the noise of people going up and down. If you are just looking for a budget/centric hotel to stay this is a good option. If you wish to get some good quality sleep go somewhere else. Again, the best things here were the professional and helpful reception and breakfast staff + hotel location."
323,"It’s a perfect hotel for those who is tired of hotels. All is perfect, design, service, soundless elevator and conditioning, perfect bed, amazing breakfast, even shampoo was in style. Eiffel Tower is close;)"
324,"Stayed one night stop over. Public areas very Sterile & clinical. Built like a maze very futuristic. Accommodation though spotless /comfortable. Lovely restaurant and food,pleasant outdoor area. Feel it is more suited to business travellers. Unfortunately not for me."
325,"My family and I stayed at the hotel from March 25 till the 27th. We parked our car in the hotel garage for our stay. We walked around visiting downtown Chicago and enjoyed our visit. I made the mistake of leaving my sons phone in the car. It was put in the middle counsel since I didn't want to loose it while walking around downtown. When we checked out the car was brought to us right on the ramp going out, so we had to rush and put our luggage in the back while I walked around my car to make sure that there was no damage (since I had just purchased it 3 months ago). I should've checked to make sure that my son's phone was still in the car, but I didn't. (which I regret) the following day I was supposed to return the phone to T Mobile so that my son could get his replacement…"
326,"Very nice hotel , Perfect location to see Berlin..in the former GDR side of the Berlin. But bang on Alexandraplatz which a very good place to see street food, fun activities and start your Berlin city tour.    Breakfast was really good for the budget hotel with some warm sandwitches options.   Rooms are good in size with a nice cupboard. And a spacious table with couple of chairs."
327,"Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. The decor is fresh and modern. The room was clean and well laid out with a very comfortable bed. The Ibis brand does not offer in-room extras like a fridge or tea/coffee making facilities but this one has its own cafe/bar and there is an Aldi not far away and cafes, restaurants and food outlets next door and across the road in the Station. The hotel breakfast was €11 but I did not try it.  The hotel is easy to find across the road from the Hauptbahnhof Station and the airport bus stops right outside. The location is excellent for walking to the Reichstag and the Brandenburg Gate and behind the Station you can pick up the hop on hop off buses.  I would recommend this hotel and I would stay there again. "
328,"Lets start by saying bare neccesties such as a working toliet and shower to say the least. Horrible staff that wasn't helpful. Booked a room at the penguin first but toilets didn't flush and shower faucet was broken. We were told by maintenance that it won't be fixed until 8am our check out is 7 for a flight. They moved us to the president ""penthouse"" two girls had to pull heavy luggage through back alleys to get to it. Service by employees sucked. One women called presidente and said someone will help u at the door. No one was there. We go back to her and she said,"" I never said that""!!!! Spend a few more dollars and don't stay at this DUMP!"
329,"If you're going to spend some time in Paris, you want to get to know the Metro. If you love the Metro, you'll love this hotel, it's right across the street from the Sevres-Lacourbe stop which means that literally everything in Paris is four or five Metro stops away.  You might think that being so close to public transit and the Boulevarde de Grenelle would mean it's noisy. You'd be wrong. The rooms are quiet and cozy, if a little small. There are also plenty of authentic French cafes within walking distance. The elevator is tiny so get used to using the stairs. They are a good warm-up for all the ones in every cathedral, monument and attraction in this city!"
330,"We were greeted by friendly staff at the front desk, who helped us settle in for the 5 nights.  The hotel has a Spanish flavour. Our room was comfortable and a good size.  We faced out on the street but there was little noise to mention. We were less than 2 blocks from the underground and a bus stop across the road. A train/bus weekly pass is the most economical transit, bought inside the station.  We only had buffet breakfast once - good but expensive.  Drinks out in the courtyard was very pleasant way to spend early evening.  We would definitely return."
331,"The position is excellent close to relevant city attraction and at border of micro centro , near metro. The starting of stay was very unpleasant the room assigned was dirty with terrible smells, after some discussion I was able to get better room. The WiFi is weak not useful for business activities, breakfast not in line with good standard only 3 warm dishes, pastry dry. Air conditioning very noisy . No comfortable plugs for phone or PC. Restaurant is ok good, acceptable price. The overhaul impression is that this hotel is worked out in the rooms, even in high level furnitures are old not well maintained. Could be excellent hotel but .....for same price you can find better standards."
332,"We arrived at around midday and were told that our room would be available at 3pm, not a big issue. We arranged some excursions with our tour operator at a meet and greet it was now heading for 1:30pm. so my wife and i went out for a little sightseeing we returned at just before 3:45pm now very tired only to be informed the room was still not ready and the consierge was unsure of the time we could have a room! When asked for somewhere to freshen up (40 hours in transit by this time) we were told we could use the spa, AT A COST!!!! only after strong words with my tour rep did we get a room at knocking on 5pm 2 hours late! later i found out some for our group were waiting for rooms at 8pm!!!! What were the staff doing!!!! I would recommend you give this hotel a wide birth and stay…"
333,"Has improved over the years but way off a so called 4star hotel , rooms all over the place and up down stairs all day long. Want to be fit to satay there. Breakfast hot food is very poor and is an easy one to solve."
334,"- Location: 300 m from metro station Place d'Italie. There are 2 lines there with good connections to other parts of the city and you can also walk to quite some nice areas of the city; - restaurants on walking distance; - very friendly and helpful staff; - very clean room; - breakfast was good and plenty plus served in my room, which was very convenient; - room was big enough; - I had a very special room: Jean Genet's room! - airconditioning, which saved me during my stay there in July."
335,"Two years ago we stayed here, and loved it except for the fact that it was very dated. At that time it was under renovation, so we couldn't wait to come back when it was done. Two years later, after looking at the pictures on their website, the ocean front rooms looked renovated and wonderful. Unfortunately the room we were assigned had not been renovated. It was old, with a very small bath and a sliding door that didn't slide. It was clean, so that would have been fine. After playing golf and returning to the room to rest, however, we were greeted with horrendous noise. It turns out that the room directly above us was being renovated with new flooring being installed. At 5:00 I went to find out how long this would go on. I ran into a gray bearded man (I learned later that he is…"
336,beautiful place but far too hilly for us no courtesy bus and hills every where a week was plenty but we would not go back we went to monte and came down on the toboggan that was great then we went on the cable cars really enjoyable
338,Wow. Beyond expectations. The staff at every turn is extremely helpful and always thinking ahead on how to make our stay even better. Restaurant was excellent. Really enjoyed the service of Tristan and Victor who were charming and attentive. Housekeeping was over the top and even during a transit strike when they were short staffed.
339,"I had a hard time rating this hotel. So many things were five star and so many things were one star. I call it a “clan” because there is very little privacy. People are always walking by your room and patio area and you can see up to their rooms and down into others. One happy family. It’s the geography! “Cave” because the rooms are cut into the sides of the precipitous cliffs that make up Santorini topography and you really are sleeping in cool, dark cave! “Bear” because you sleep so well in a cave you nearly hibernate.  I cannot really call this a luxury hotel because it is so dangerous and difficult to climb down and up from your room. The stairs are uneven in the extreme. I didn’t realize most of the hotels in Oia are like that, so be prepared. I understand now that…"
341,"Great location, comfortable bed, excellent bed linens, large bathroom and very friendly staff.  Pleasantly surprised, allowed to check in earlier than specified time of 2PM!!!  Would definately stay here again."
342,"Accommodation great, plus location is perfect for easy access (by tram or on foot) to centre of town.   Staff very helpful and the social space on 6th floor is a cool place to spend some time. That said, they need to get basics like housekeeping sorted. Our room wasn't cleaned once in 4 days, nor were our towels exchanged. I'm sure it will improve with time.   Recommended for couples or business travel. Loft beds not practical/safe if there are very small kids in the room. "
343,Great stay.  Very comfortable clean hotel.  Good facilities for a small hotel. Excellent and very helpful staff. Breakfast each day catered for most diet preferences. Would not hesitate to stay there again.
344,"Hotel Curiousl is very convenient.  It is on a one way street several blocks from  La Rambla. It is very clean, the included breakfast quite good, the help very accommodating. Only suggestion is try to avoid the economy double. It is very small.  With suitcases open barely any room to pass by between the bed and the wall.  Also probably a temporary situation but the tv had no English channels."
346,"the room smeeled funny and it was a bit too warm regardless it was spring, we turned on the air conditioning and tried opening the window but it didn't work. Anyway Ibis is always a good value for money and for sure this is not the best Ibis I have been at."
347,"More Hostel than Hotel, but the location is perfect for the younger Berlin Tourist. If you get a room in the 7th floor view to Alexanderplatz, you have a cool view on the awakening Berlin. The surroundings are perfect for hanging round, eating, party is a little bit away."
348,"We stayed for four days pre tour. The reception staff were good but the overall service is very patchy. The room card had to be recharged 5 times. Sometimes it wouldn’t open the room sometimes it wouldn’t drive the lift. There are rooms being renovated and one afternoon we had drilling and construction noise all afternoon. It was during a heat wave and we wanted to stay out of the heat. Housekeeping is very haphazard - 1 day no water or coffee replenished. 1 day room not cleaned at all. One day no face cloths no shower caps. The housekeeping staff need serious training. The younger bar staff also need training. No service, bad service, being given the wrong bill, and then doubt because we had paid cash. Waiting for a drink for 10 mins and then being told that the young waiter…"
349,If you are staying in Tresor or Sorento tower facing the pool ... fontainebleu landscaping subcontractoes will wake you up every day at 6:30AM...tje only way forward is to pray for early morning shower... incredible.. nevers seen such an ignorance in Florida. 
350,"A very nicely designed hotel with comfortable beds and nice and clean (particularly the bathroom). It really shows that the designers of the hotel have worked hard to get an art deco feeling and they have been very successful. Unfortunately the hotel is suffering from severe teething problems - even though we had pre-ordered and pre-paid for two rooms we were only able to get one room before 14:00 while the other room was available for us very late in the afternoon. The breakfast was totally chaotic with clearly not enough staff available. We had to find and clear our own breakfast table, we had to wait extensively for scrambled eggs, pancakes and other things that should have been served for breakfast. When we asked for ketchup the existing staff was clueless and had no idea if…"
351,The lobby and rooms haven't been refreshed since the fall of the Qing dynasty. It looks grim. There are few international visitors and staff have difficulty in providing Western levels of greeting and courtesy.
352,"Restaurant size is disappointingly small and is overcrowded for a lot of the time despite having two  evenings. Very limited outdoor seating! The  was buffet food was barely  warm and often tepid. Plentiful supply of fish was served but only once the celebrated scabbard fish one evening only we were able to dine out in one of the specialist restaurants  (Italian )where the food was warmer and better quality (but still below what you would expect in an Italian restaurant).  They were seldom open and therefore not possible to book them more than once in the week that we stayed. All staff were very polite kind and helpful, making you feel most welcome. if you want a room which is not cramped you will need to upgrade at least two levels from the basic classic room Good views from…"
353,"We booked the “family room” which is essentially a junior suite, king bed with pull out sofa chairs and small table, plenty of room and very big for a “euro” style hotel, very clean and modern, great location (walking distance to)to Zoo Palast, Kurfürstendamm, KaDeWe, Wilhelm church, Shops, Bars, Restaurants, Tiergarten, U1, Fuggerstrasse, and much much more...only negative was no in room coffee "
354,"I stayed one weekend with my family, we went out to visit San Francisco and we came back we noticed some of my mother's belonging were missing. We reported the incident and I was told I should have put those in the safety box. They told me they will contact me with any information and I am still waiting for them to contact me. This is a very nice and charming hotel but the service is very bad. Breakfast is expensive and not good. Location is excellent. I definitely won't stay here again."
355,"Great location, friendly & helpful staff, no room service.  Almost non-existent wi-fi. So for a business trip, not the best!  But perhaps for a 'discover the city as a couple', would be a good option....  "
356,It is placed in front of train station  Close to restaurant and shopping street  Very beautiful and amazing decoration  Nice and polite staff  Very cute terrace  Air conditioner is available  Good quality product in bathroom  Breakfast is ok 
357,"It's a hotel located in downtown Rio, pretty far from the beaches and stuff, so the only possible purpose of one's stay here is having business in this particular area. Therefore, should such motives keep you away from the hotel for most of the day, it might as well work just fine: the bed is comfortable, the shower is good, the breakfast is tasteful and with a large variety and the room is quite wide.  However, there is one certain element which puts all these fair atributes to waste, and this is the hotel's staff. Never had I been to a hotel with such an unhelpful and repellent staff. They never smile – at all, and in all positions, which makes me believe it's an official instruction –, ""good morning"" and assorted greetings are unknown to them, and they simply don't seem to…"
358,"Good location but make sure you verify all details by fax or email we arrived with 2 rooms booked (2 males) but recieved 1 They do not accept female visitors to rooms with 2 males. Considering  a big mistake with the booking ( or trying to sell more rooms) this was not plesant. A$12,000 airfares each this is not the Hotel you should be looking for. Management in the main helpfull but expect some personality problems. It also did not help that there was a small civil problem with 18 people being killed in one night because of civil disobedience. Overall this is not the Hotel for people who expect the usual service that is maintained in US or other first world countries. Expect problems and be prepared to have patience and pay cash for the unexpected requests. By the way intenet…"
359,"Nice location, walking distance from Friedrich Strasse and some of the major sites to see including Brandeburg Tor on the side and the Museum Island on the other. Well served by underground and close to August Strasse (full of art galleries) and the nice places to eat in Mitte.  Room was clean, well kept, with nice window. Not big but well proportioned and space arranged efficiently. Better to go alone or as a couple given some lack of privacy/division between the bedroom and the bath tub+sink.  Good and helpful service.  All in: not cheap, but very good value for the price paid considering location (Mitte) and the quality of the room. Breakfast: done in the THEKE bar/restaurant next to the hotel (a convention-type of arragement also exists). Very good!  Would definitely…"
360,"We are just coming to the end of our holiday here and have mixed feelings about the Hotel. It is for sure in a pretty good location and although the building is a bit concrete ugly, the facilities and especially the sea level pool area is pretty impressive and a great area to relax and unwind. No noisy animations or music blasting out, just the genital crashing of the waves against the sea defences with 3 salt water infinity pools.. Crystal clear water and easy access to the sea for some great snorkelling, plenty of fish to see. The other Hotel facilities are pretty average and are what you would expect, very clean and tidy, comfortable rooms but some would say a bit clinical, certainly not cosy or chic. Beds are massive and comfortable but the additional pull out sofa beds are…"
361,"We had an average time but honestly I think we were just unlucky.  Firstly, our dorm (room O2) was weird, we arrived late afternoon and there were people sleeping which is whatever but this continued through our stay where people would sleep throughout the entire day. This obviously is what you have to expect sometimes with dorms but what made it super awkward and uncomfortable was that there was hardly any natural light so the room was constantly dark, dingy and uninviting. We made an effort to spend as little time as possible in our dorm. It was also located on the lower level right near the showers and staff cleaning area so it could be pretty loud in the mornings due to all the traffic of people.   Secondly, I got bitten horrendously by what I assume was bed bugs, this…"
363,My wife and I just stayed at the Hotel Da Vinci this past weekend.  Our stay was absolutely fantastic!  The staff was friendly and helpful and the hotel was great!  We had an early arrival and our room was ready before noon.  Thanks for being so accommodating.  Looking forward to returning soon!
364,"The Hilton Hotel Berlin was a very nice hotel to stay in but I was told they would not give me Hilton Honors points because I was with a group and they did not know in advance of my stay.  YES THEY DID! So I have a little problem with the staff who made this decision.  The rest of the hotel was beautiful and I would recommend it.  My room was really nice, service was good, and generally all employees treated me okay.  Bar service is really slow and they tend to ignore you even if you're standing right in front of them."
365,"Flight was delayed by 8 hours, we had paid to park on the property of this hotel so after our return from the airport we went to holiday inn. We asked for a half day rate to rest until our flight was to leave and were told they did not offer this. After eating an awful breakfast in their restaurant ""coaches"" we sat in the lobby and my brother in law started to doze off. We were approached by an employee telling us that we could get a half day rate for $100 or we had to leave. This was denied to us several hours earlier and we now had less than 2 hrs to wait for our flight. Tried to notify management unsuccessfully because we were then childishly ignored and lied to about the situation that occured."
366,We spent two nights at azimut. The rooms were cleaned daily and were comfortable. Breakfast was good with plenty of choice. It is a  15 min walk to the u bahn however a bus runs from the crossroads. The reception staff were helpful and polite .i would recommend this hotel as it is good value for money
367,"I stayed at this hotel on 29 and 30 December 2012. I have read most of the reviews (unfortunately afterwards) and I have to agree that it has a perfect locality and that is about it.. Even the beds are "" Art Deco"" meaning it is still the old type of beds  and worn out mattresses. The walls are all "" dry walling"" with no soundproofing and the noise is no joke! I asked at reception if we could do something about the mattresses after the first night and I am still awaiting the person who would get back to me to contact me. I also think the compulsory $15 per day resort fee is not worth the money. I have to agree with most reviewers that this hotel needs a upgrade and that the manager should first get this in order before she continues to try and defend the same points made by most…"
368,"We’ve been coming here for years but sadly it seems to be going downhill. Most notably on our last visit- an overnight couples 24 hour getaway - even though when we checked in we were assured that we were welcome to enjoy the pool and hot tub, a major draw for us, when we were relaxing at the pool the next day we were bothered repeatedly by a staff person and followed by a manager who came to explain to us in great lengthy detail that we were not welcome and needed to pay $40 each if we wanted to stay. This was the opposite of relaxing or welcoming hospitality. It was stressful and upsetting to be treated this way when we had splurged for a relaxing couples retreat. If the pool use is not included this should be communicated when the reservation is made. In our case we were told…"
370,"The reception is very unprofessional as well as inexperienced. Even though the villa is pretty roomy but not enough bed for everyone. Air conditioning is very bad. Services are so slow. Even though it is a low season, there are ample of empty villas but we are refused to get a villa which is closer to the beach.  Staff at the poolside is also very unfriendly.  We will not visit again!"
371,Was looking forward to staying here but with all the reviews pointing out the building work adj to the hotel we decided to contact thomson spoke to a great chap called Sam swapped at no extra cost to another hotel  with little or no problems.  Well done Sam
373,"We were here in late June for 2 or 3 nights.  surprisingly quiet, smallish rooms, good service, good basic breakfast.  We were quite satisfied at all that, and the price, too.  Close to the Nation metro stops, giving access in lots of directions.  Would definitely go there again if we were focusing our visit on the eastern side of the city."
374,"We reserved short weekend to visit Camp Nou and see a FC Barcelona to play. This hotel was excellent choice with walking distance to the field. City Center was reached easily with few stops metro trip. Even shopping facilities were close. The hotel itself was nice and personnel polite and friendly. Huge breakfast was included with a lot of varieties. Even the hotel reastaurant served excellent food, although really silend due to special weekend."
375,"The hotel is superficially okay, and in a good location, but lots of small things add up and annoy.  The good points are that the reception staff are charming and pleasant, and the Ipanema beach service is also excellent.    The annoying things are: 1. Lousy wifi.  First, it costs USD10 per day.  Second, it resets several times a day and requires a new login if you move around the hotel.  Third, it did not work in my room - I had to lurk in the corridor.  Fourth, it restricts the number of devices so iPhone, iPad, Laptop (x 2 for couple) and you have a problem.  Don’t come here if you have to stay in touch with work. 2. The toilet seat didn’t stay up.  3. There is no sound insulation.  You can hear every movement and toilet flush from the room above.  4. Bar staff indifferent. …"
377,"I travel often for business & leisure. This was by far the worst hotel experience I've ever had. I don't know where to start. We arrived at the hotel at 5pm and were told our rooms wouldn't be ready until 8pm (although we had a reservation). When we finally received our rooms, the electricity was out in one of them! We called the front desk and it took them almost 24 hours to fix this issue. Another issue was housekeeping. They cleaned our rooms daily by simply making our beds---no new towels, no emptied trash and no clean sheets. Be weary of valet, the scratched my rental costing me $300. The only thing good about this hotel was its location. This is NOT your typical Marriott."
378,"Do not trust your booing at this hotel !! , me and my wife arrived at this hotel after an 11 hour flight on the 2nd August 2013, having a prepaid reservation made 10 months in advance, and confirmed to our travel agents Trailfinders, by Greg Cordova, only to be told they had overbooked and were going to walk us to another hotel, they did not have the curtesy to inform ourselves or our travel agents in advance. This made the start of our very special holiday, our 25th Anniversary a nightmare. Eventually we were put in a taxi and moved to a Marriott Hotel, they tried to make us change for 2 days of our 4 day stay. Whatever the hotel said they knew for months before hand that they were overbooked as they had a very large party staying there. I can understand mistakes can be made…"
379,"The best thing is that this hotel offers free Shuttle bus to/from the Airport. First checked inn to the room where was some problems with a heating system, but without any problems we changed the room later on. New room  was much better... seamed newly refurbished. Small, but very comfortable. Bathroom with a heated floor , soft bed &good pillows, working desk, tea facilities."
380,"I spent 5 nights in this wonderful hotel, I got a very special room at the pool floor, very nice! staff is extremely kind and available to help and assist you! I really suggest to everybody to stay there! very close to la Crosette but in a very quiet area! Very good breakfast side by side to the swimming pool in the garden! Thanks for all!"
381,"- signed in ... they forgot to take my credit card and made a big deal about it later - dumped wine on my wife - acknowledged it but did nothing about it - left my camera memory card in the safe - they could not find it - I am not sure they even looked - very expensive loss to me - poorly made bed ... really terrible .. sheets wrinked and not set straight - wife's clothes rolled up in a ball and left on the bed ...  - ordered scrambled eggs and stringy bacon - received an omlette, they acknowledge the mistake .. and promptly made me another omlette!   - you need to walk through the dinning area to get to the gym ... bathrobe and all - thin walls ... we heard the couple next door making out every night  it is not like we did not tell staff this - they all just politely nod and…"
383,"Was sent here by TAP, pretty central in Lisbon. As usual this chain has amazing beds. Front desk staff was very nice at check-in. Good breakfast, nice to see staff in that good mood on a saturday morning."
384,"Very clean, bathroom good size, room ok. Stylish, but no drawers, don't like putting everything out on show. . You need drawer for personnel items, I literally took clothes out of suitcase in one go and put down on open shelf, un-packing done. Seating area outside not best of views but you can people watch and keep cool in the shade. Breakfast really good, something for every taste. The Restaurant  menu seemed to be the same each night. Reception will advise you on things but no Tourist leaflets maps openly available. Remember pavements are cobbled and uneven, safer to wear flat shoes, plus if it rains  can be slippy. plus we thought more like 25mins to centre and after day out more like 1/2 hour Back. But you can always stop for a drink."
385,"This is not a Hotel, it is a Hostel that pretends to be a Hotel. I dont know which stock library they used to get the photos of their rooms, but they should have used the money they spent on someone else's photos on some cleaning products. The place stinks of urine. You have to enter the place through a cage door. The internet was slow and pathetic (which is fine, though they suggest it is great). The rooms are tiny and unclear. They have one toilet per floor, no bathrooms in the rooms. The breakfast is a joke. They couldnt even take a phone message, not to mention that there were no phones in the rooms.   Look, they gave it a go and it is fine if you want a backpackers. But is over priced as a backpackers and they suggest that they are a hotel and they are not.   Give this…"
386,"Old hotel that needed an urgent update probably 10yrs ago so you can only imagine it now. No point updating pics of all the outdated, broken, damaged things in the room 'cause it would take a while... In a good location but at this stage, unfortunately, next to a construction site. Drilling started 7am (Saturday morning) and is only 30m from the hotel so the noise is unbearable. Went for breakfast and had to wait 10min standing with a plate in my hand for a free table. Restaurant area is the smallest I ever saw in such a big hotel. Urgently needs a better solution. Flight crews occupied 70% of the restaurant area having loooong slooow breakfast. (Don't get me wrong, why wouldn't they sit, chat and relax?! But in that case, hotel needs to provide a bigger eating area) Other than…"
387,"I have rented a 4p room for me and two other people. The price was a little more than you usually pay for a hostel, but everything was tidy and clean and the bedroom had a private bathroom. I highly recommend for travelling in groups!"
388,"Less than a 28 euro cab ride into town, about a half an hour during evening rush hour. Clean, convenient, central location, with the metro(Tetuan  station) 1 1/2 blocks away or the de Gracias station 2 1/12 blocks. Great section of town for food, shops and bars. You will find everything you need within walking distance. And speaking of walking, Barcelona is geared towards the pedestrian, even the crossing lights are timed. The staff were extremely helpful and spoke fluent English and will endear themselves to you very quickly. One of the best restaurants in town is just two doors down called Las 7 Maravillas. So all in all, this is a great hotel in one of the greatest cities in the world and remember, continue to learn, live and love food."
389,We stayed at the beginning of Oct 18  It was a lovely hotel room although small & compact. But had everything needed. It was decorated nice. Everything was working as it should.  Rooms were cleaned daily!  Hotel staff were great and very helpful. Food in the restaurant was amazing. We ended up eating there a few times during our stay.  Pretty central to all public services bus/tram& metro lines.  Good location!!!!    
390,"The location is just about the only really good thing is about this hotel in the city centre, very close to the railway station, big shopping centre and the Old Town. However, the hotel itself is rather dingy and low quality. Rooms are tiny and not comfortable, they feel cramped and suffocating. That said, it didn’t look to be dirty. Breakfast was barely edible though, it looks like they‘re skimping on everything possible - the cheapest sausages, omelette made of powdered eggs, warm orange water masquerading as juice, even the coffee was just bad. I’m sure there are better places for the same price. Seriously."
391,"I just received the worst customer service I can imagine with a hotel, and I am appalled that a hotel can get away with treating customers this way!! I booked this hotel 10 months before my work conference. This was necessary since the conference brings in 30,000 attendees and hotels book up quickly. I booked on Booking.com for $150, and I was thrilled because it is one block from the McCormick Place Convention Center and was much cheaper than the other hotels recommended by the conference organizers.  To my dismay, the owner called me 4 days before the trip and told me they were overbooked and they would be moving me to a hotel 8 miles away in Lincoln Park.  Since I booked 10 months beforehand, I questioned why I was the one getting bumped. The owner basically told me they made…"
393,"We stayed at Villa Blanche 4 nights. I was there for MipTV and my wife on semi-holidays. Great welcome by the B&B owners. All our requests were met. Very cozy, family, country style living, available private parking space, cute breakfast area with all basics + great ingredients. Definitely recommended but keep in mind this is a B&B not a hotel."
395,"Well-appointed hotel in a quiet tree-lined street only a few minutes walk from the Ku'damm.  U-bahn Augsburgerstrasse is at the end of the road less than 100 mtrs away.  Hotel has five floors and parking under.  Rooms are quite modern with a black & white theme to them.  All very clean.  Staff very friendly and seem to speak many languages.  Meals are quite expensive but there are numerous cafes and restaurants nearby catering to a variety of palates.  My only complaint would be that the shower, although very modern and efficient, did not have a door or screen.  Consequently, the bathroom was swimming with water every time the shower was used.  There are two lifts for guest use."
396,"As always when reviewing a hotel, you need to keep in mind what the hotel claims to be and judge accordingly. The H2 is a budget hotel and as a budget hotel offers excellent value and quality for the money. The location is a major plus. That is why I am giving an excellent-rating because the H2 is an excellent budget hotel. Reception was quick and efficient. We were checked in within 10 minutes of arrival.  The rooms are on the smaller side but fine for a four day stay. They are nicely done with a light color-combination. The bathroom was nicely arranged with a great shower. The room was clean and everything in the room functioned well. The bed was comfortable, and the combination of shutters and drapes kept the room dark and quiet overnight. I really liked the room and don’t…"
397,"We have stayed here before and this was the worst stay! The shower continually and completely shutoff! Our room which we were told was ""newly remodeled"" had a terrible mattress! We are not big people but anytime my husband or I would turn in bed, the entire mattress would move! It was soft and not sturdy. The bathroom is the smallest too! The rates are sky high now for a comfort inn - stay at one of the two Marriotts in fisherman's wharf. You can get the same price as here. Also, they refused to give us out points because we booked through another site. We booked through another site to save a bit of money. We deserve our points! Ridiculous!"
398,"This hotel is just amazing. It is round the corner from Goncourt metro which is a short trip to the big attractions. Short walk from Le Marais which is a viberant part of Paris. The staff - nothing is too much bother for them, they are so friendly and on hand 24 hours a day. The hotel itself is beautifully decorated with modern, clean and comfortable rooms. My partner ended up being ill on our last night which meant we were unable to travel home. The staff helped us by first extending the room while we saw the doctor then extending the stay. They also helped and scanned our documents for the insurance. Would recommend this hotel to anyone."
399,"This charming hotel provided all the Paris charm we wanted. Central location, helpful and friendly staff. Our room was small and had everything we needed, plus the Paris view, true to the ad.  We will return!"
401,The hotel reception are very helpful in anything at any time. There is no hesitation to answer any questions or requests at any moment.  The hotel staff are so friendly. They properly clean the room daily.  Hotel location is very good … you can get by car to around for everything in 15 - 20 minutes. By walking there are nearby shops (8-9 minutes to go to a nearby mall).  Hotel parking is so safe and the rates are good. There are always vacant spaces.  A big supermarket and a bakery + few shops in ground floor makes life easier.  Hotel beds and pillows are comfortable.
402,"Stayed here for 4 nights, hotel was clean and staff were very friendly with good English. Rooms were cleaned daily, hotel is in great area for access to trains. Only down side was the air conditioner was poor quality "
403,"Friday night coming down for the Surf Cup Soccer Tournament, my room was infested with ants in the bathroom.  No empty rooms available so they comped the night.  I was given two vacuums and two disinfecting bottles from the security guard and at midnight, I spent my time spraying down the bathroom and furniture counter and vacuuming the room so I could go to sleep without fear of ants crawling all over me.  Sat, was able to switch rooms, but at midnight this time a 1 hr argument fight seemed to turn violent next door, and I had to ask front desk to call police because I feared for the woman who was going ballistic with her husband.  They sent instead a female security guard who seemed a little intimidated, so I had to be there and bare witness for her so that she could confront…"
404,The hotel is to cute.  Right across from a metro stop. Room were very comfortable and modern although small. Breakfast was so good. Exceeded my expectations.  I would definitely stay here again.  Small boutique hotel.   Not centrally located but easy to get around. With lots of eating choices.  
405,"We booked the hotel 6 months earlier, directly with the hotel and had prepaid everything upon booking. We made a request for a certain type of room and Lesley Porter replied immediately offering help. Hotel is very easy to find with just 2 minutes away from Solterdijk Station.  Upon arrival we made our check in and we were given a paper to sign with our room number(706) and confirming the non smoking policy. However, we were given a different room. When we asked why, the receptionist on duty explained that our room was not ready yet. We decided to have a look at the room and wasn't the one we preferred. Went down to reception and explained our situation to the receptionist and acknowledged that he read our e-mail request and asked us to wait until the room is ready. So we did,…"
406,"Spent 6 weeks at the hotel. Very clean hotel with great service and accommodating staff. The manager, Julien was outstanding, always there to assist. Location was perfect for us, lots of restaurants in the neighborhood and grocery stores. There are 4 train stations within walking distance, which served our purpose. Will definitely stay there again. "
407,Yays at Bicker does not have a reception. This is a big problem.  Location is OK. Service is poor. No phone. No coffee and sugar replacement. The key did not work one night and we were left out !  I would not go back ! 
408,"Our stay in Buenos Aires came at the end of our 3 week South American holiday. We had flight problems and arrived at nearly midnight, without our luggage. We were met at the gate by a man who silently showed us our ""suite"", a tiny room off the entry courtyard, containing a double mattress on a dirty looking queen size box spring, no place to put any luggage, a few hangers on a rod under the television shelf. Other reviewers have commented on peeling paint, and our bedcover was not clean looking.One nightstand was a small refrigerator filled with sodas, water, etc. Not a good first impression, but the bath looked OK, and we were exhausted. The next morning, we awoke, went to breakfast, which was adequate with pastry, toast, fruit...never seen again, coffee and juice. At nine,…"
409,"check in very fast, bath room was small and uncomofortable, terasse is not good, because this place looks like us smoking place, parking is very comfortable, place of hotel is great, around is allsings"
410,"Sorry to say that after two weeks in Argentina and Brazil this was our least favorite place. I honestly cannot recommend this to any of our friends or family.  Pros:  Pool - Great view of Christ statue and Sugarloaf from the hotel pool Provided a room for showering/changing since we had a late flight Cons Pool - Service was horrible. You couldn't find anyone at the pool until noon and service was incredibly slow. I also had the pleasure of watching construction on the hotel gym all day although the front desk staff told me that the gym was open upon arrival at the hotel Rooms - Completely lack any character. We had a corner room with a great view, but the bathroom was old and dingy.  Front Desk - At all of the hotels during our trip we were given a hotel tour but at this hotel…"
411,"We stayed at this hotel in July 2017 for 4 nights from July 24th to July 28th.  On arrival our bed was a double bed instead of twin beds as we had booked so this had to be rectified and it was done so within the hour.  The hotel does not offer a restaurant to dine so you have to find a restaurant outside somewhere or order from the limited room service menu. There was constant noise though most of the nights we stayed there - initially we thought it was coming from the streets outside (it sounds like something being dragged on a steel surface or a small train / underground service) so there wasnt a lot you could do about it.  However on the last day while waiting in the lounge for our uber, we heard the same sound again and it is the sound of heavy suitcases (it appears) being…"
413,"Booked this hotel via Voyage Prive so paid a lot less than the rack rate for a design room (£456 for 3 nights) and it was totally worth the money. First things, check in was easy with fizz and hot towels provided. Rooms are a good size, though the totally see through glass panel is very open and if you are a large person (luckily we are not) it could be tight fitting round the toilet door. Coffee nachine anc turn down chocolates/extra water was a nice touch. Front desk was really helpful too, booking us Park Guell tickets. Breakfast was ok, poached eggs cold but good selection of pastries, meats and breads. Roof top area is really nice, pool is heated so can swim even if not that warm outside. I can imagine it gets packed in summer as even in March we couldn't get a bed to lie…"
414,"This is a quaint hotel close to the eiffel tower which is walking distance,  also close to the river Seine. We had many a walk along the Seine, visited many place by foot. If you are young enough and especially fit enough all or most places of interest are walking distance,  we averaged a total of 16k per day, that way you miss nothing and get to see everything. We did hop on hop off bus in London because of the slow traffic we give up and went on foot. The traffic in Paris is also slow. The hotel had coffee making facilities although we had to go down stairs for extra coffee and milk and even the stash at the help yourself counter was low on stock. The bed was comfy, all amenities that you need. A very enjoyable stay. Oooo not forgetting Emma who checked us in, she was very…"
415,"We are repeat guests at the palace hotel and are here for our anniversary. We arrived to a strike going on outside the hotel, and the noise and discomfort within the lobby of the hotel is unsettling. Maid service is at a minimum, we even had a half bottle of mouthwash left in our room when we arrived along with a used shoe mit stuffed back in the box! They are not offering any in room dining, and bar is-half staffed as well. We were NEVER informed ahead of time of the strike, which we should have been, especially considering there had been no offer of room discount, Hotel had been non transparent with their guests! We definitely have been left with a terrible experience and will NOT choose  the palace hotel when we are in SF again! "
416,"Bottom line: Make 100% sure that you are speaking to the actual hotel, not one of their off site customer care lines, when you make or change your reservation. They do not honor changes made by off-site customer care lines. When you call the main line 1 (312) 372-7200 - MAKE SURE TO PRESS 0. Do not Press 1 or 2 or any other number. MAKE SURE TO PRESS 0 to speak to the hotel directly.  The hotel seems beautiful. But we never got to stay there. The customer service is all over the place. There is not clear communication between the hotel and their offsite customer care lines. I got conflicting information from everyone I spoke with.  I had a reservation, broke my foot and called to see if I could cancel the reservation. They told me no, because it was less than 72 hours I could…"
417,"My family and I stayed at this hotel and it did not disappoint. We arrived early before our room was ready but the staff was very accommodating and stored our luggage.    When we returned about an hour later our luggage was already in our room with complimentary food vouchers for the onsite restaurant. Our room was more of a studio apartment with sink, refrigerator, microwave, and computer included. The room also had top notch products such as L'occitane, Nespresso, a variety of teas and slippers.  The onsite restaurant is wonderful!  The restaurant food was the best food we had while in Paris and reasonably price. The staff was great and spoke fluent English; which was helpful when asking directions. We will definitely be staying here again on our next visit to Paris."
418,"This hotel promises alot from the reviews and I can only assume that I had a bad stay, aside from the good location the hotel itself is tired and the staff are inattentive; it would have been appreciated if they had paid the same close attention to my request for some towels as they did to charging me for an early check in. The rooms are very average and functional, bathrooms pretty grotty with mine having an especially unattractive chocolate smear across the door. The internet connection was appalling specifically given the additional charge and the early morning walk to breakfast was like a slalom through discarded room service trays in the hallway."
419,"The hotel is modern and has a beautiful view of the Caldera. However, there are some issues here, especially regarding the prices charged for this hotel (average USD800/day):  - NO PRIVACY:  we stayed in two different rooms - Junior Suite with Sea View and Superior with Infinity Pool and Caldera View. The first one is very very small and from my balcony I could see everything from the room below (there was a guy sunbathing naked). So, no privacy for that room. Besides that, everyone in the parking lot could see everything in our balcony. As for the other room (Superior with Infinity pool), you don't get your own pool - mind that you do have your own little private piece of the pool but that the pool is shared with the other rooms. So, you actually stand side by side with other…"
420,"Backpackers Bcn is very nice hostel, i felt like at home. I really like the curtains for every bed, because they do some privacy place only for you. Staff is very friendly and all hostel is Very clean place."
421,"After reading the reviews, i decided to book the hotel and i am very happy i did. This is a fairly new hotel, it was done in 2016. The rooms are clean and small but this is France, everything is small! The location is amazing, you are in the heart of Cannes. Seconds away from the Starbucks, seconds away from the train station. 5 minutes walking from the Croisette Boulevard, 10 minutes away from the public beach. Breakfast is included and is really good. To our surprise, we had complimentary wine and snacks from 7 to 10pm. They have a beautiful outdoor sitting area on the top floor where you can enjoy a glass of wine while looking at the city. Would stay here again!"
422,"This hotel is old and run down. My room had an old feel to it, the sink would not drain, the shower was disgusting, the only outlets to plug in we're across the room. I was very disappointed. I travel a lot and all over the world and this is one of the worst I have stayed anywhere, ever. Avoid if you can. "
423,Staff are really welcoming and helpful and the location is fantastic our recommendation though would be to get a deluxe room as 5he standards are very small and a bit dark.  Thanks for a great stay and we would recommend. 
426,"We have been traveling through France for the past six weeks going the Airbnb route.  We stumbled unto a very bad stay and so had to seek hotel accommodation.  We found The Cavindish based on good reviews and they did not disappoint.  Clean, wonderful...they even let us pick our room.  Artful touches like the morning breakfast (that has yet to be beat in any of our travels, complimentary), the tea time as well as happy hour...dear lord, heaven!  The staff, in particular, are attentive, kind and wonderful people.  You could not have a better stay than at the Cavindish.    We had a unique situation. Traveling through France for six weeks means a whole lot of wine...we needed to stow this wine while in Barcelona for a job interview and this hotel, without charging allowed us to…"
427,"my wife and myself recently travelled to berlin for the weekend .We flew Ryanair from Dublin to Schönefeld and walked the 5 minute journey to the train station, be aware the walkway is roofed but open, were we got our tickets due to the ticket machine in the airport being out of order and then got the train to alexanderplatz, don't forget to validate your ticket in the yellow pillar, we changed in alexanderplatz and got another train to spittlemarkt where we got off and walked the short distance to the Adina Apartment Hotel Berlin Checkpoint Charlie on Krausenstrasse . We had booked the hotel going through comparison site kayak and getting a good deal with amoma as we had done before. the checkin process was smooth and we proceeded to our apartment. the apartment was a good size…"
428,"Upon entering the hotel I looked to the left and saw trash on the floor in the cafe. I checked in to my room and upon entering, I smelled smoke. I went back downstairs and shared this info with the FD. The quickly moved me to a new hotel. When I went back up to get my luggage, there was a person actually smoking! They upgraded me to a suite, which was kind. The room itself was clean but the noise is not great. I could hear everything my neighbors were saying. The wireless never worked for me and I found myself having to go to my office early in the morning. The coffee shop was dirty every morning when I went down and the service was not great. The pastries were awful. Hard. This hotel is listed as a recommended hotel from my corp. office - I have sent them a note and strongly…"
429,"The Corner Hotel is a lovely boutique hotel in Barcelona.  We had a room with a city view which I highly recommend.  Helpful staff and nice accommodations.  One thing to keep in mind, its not quite in the heart of downtown.  Getting to the main streets to shop including Las Ramblas is about a mile walk.  Not the most convenient location but I loved that is was quiet."
431,"Arrived at the normal check-in time....the lobby is FILLED with people ready to check in.  The staff - overwhelmed.  Too many people wanting rooms, too few staff to check in...and a lot of mostly Chinese nationals who were very very rude (pushing, shoving, shouting).  Finally, we get a room - smelly!  We told the check in staff that the room was very smelly, they said nothing they could do.  We asked for another room, again, spoke with the hotel manager who said: yes, but we have to wait an hour.  Okay, so we get the room - NOISY (the beach side, which we paid extra to have, is quiet...the other sides:  construction all around).  We take it...noisy we can tolerate, smell, you cannot, not with 2 young children.   Meals:  a huge buffet area...the same pushy Chinese were there…"
432,We begin by entering the front steps where the valet man decided to help us with our bags free of charge. He was very considerate of us and our belongings. We get to the desk and the Lobby worker told us our room wasn't ready yet but we could leave our bags with the valet and they would secure it for us. We were a little hesitant but he gave us a voucher and locked his room behind us. We were grateful for that. We began to roam around Miami Beach and they called us an hour later saying our room was ready even though it wasn't supposed to be ready until 1. We got into our room at 11. It was great to be able to go back and relax after a long cruise. We got up to the room and what we walked into was not what we thought we were going to get. Other than the pink all over the cabinets…
433,"Our stay was pleasant and the staff made sure we we're comfortable. The hotel has a great location, within walking distance to all important places: Louvre, Musee D'Orsay, Tour Eiffel, Arc de Triomphe, Montmartre."
434,"lots of little things.... Access to room is hard, fire hazard in fact... go down the wrong stairwell and you will end in a dead in trash filled back alley/garbage space. b-fast is a laugh, lame lame. room has TWO bathrooms but the mattress is older than i am and no fridge. staff can't keep my key card working, which means another long trip back to the lobby for a fix. am paying $12 per day for parking here in my over priced hotel. That should be something that is included, i have NEVER had to pay to park at my own hotel. on top of that the spaces are so small someone scratched my vehicle while they were trying to park. i will NEVER stay here again and will NOT recommend."
435,"t was a not a pleasant start when I arrived at the Hotel where a Dog was going around and I felt bit annoyed about that, The reception guys seems very busy a big group of travellers where waiting to get their key's, after 15 mins of Delay, I got my card, but the Card wasn't working in the lift I tired for 5 times changed the card for 3 times, I have asked for assistance someone else tried as well still no clue about what's happening, finally got that fixed after15 mins of further delay, the room size was too small for the price they charge, The smoking area has got nice air-conditioned facility, however the dog food was all over the place and I felt sick of going inside the smoking room, overall its not upto the standards and I would not stay here anymore, as we have plenty of…"
436,I would like to say a huge thank you to all the staff. I took my partner here for our anniversary. Anna was so accommodating when she found out it was our anniversary. At no point was we made to feel uncomfortable as a Queer couple of colour. The hotel is beautiful. Breakfast amazing. Lovely sunset in loft 14. Transport link perfect. To our beautiful queer brother in the maverick work it girl. Berlin you have been great to us 🖤😘🌈
437,"Perfect location, very clean and comfortable. Fully recommended.I will choose it again if I travel to Paris. Nice environment and staff. Only problem they didn’t tell us that the tourist taxes wasn’t included in the price"
438,Stayed here as part of a package with one night's accommodation pre-cruise.  We checked in around 1.30pm and our room was ready.  Not all were as some checking in before us had to leave their luggage in a locked room.  We were extremely grateful as we'd been up since 3am for an early morning flight from Birmingham.  It was St George's Day and Barcelona city was celebrating.  The hotel gave all the ladies red roses and in the streets surrounding  the hotel there were bands playing and families thoroughly enjoying the celebrations.  All the cafes and restaurants were very busy and it was a great atmosphere.  Our room was similar to a UK Premier Inn - the bed was comfortable and we had a view of Sagrada Familia from our top floor room.  We've been to Barcelona a few times and…
439,"I stayed at Hotel Zelos on a recommendation through my company's travel center. The hotel had decent enough ratings, so I wasn't worried going into my trip. The room was smaller than expected, and the cleaning staff didn't pay the closest attention to detail, but overall the amenities were fine. However, when I checked out of my hotel room, I left some baggage at the front desk for safe keeping. Upon my return, I was told my luggage had been given to a different guest, but the hotel staff would 'keep me updated' about when it was returned. No one called me to update me about anything, and I had to return to hotel to get a number that I could call. The fact that this wasn't provided to be as soon as the incident occurred is unacceptable. Finally, two days after the incident, the…"
440,"It’s not to say that there is anything particularly wrong with this hotel, but it is incredibly hard to find any redeeming features that would make me want to visit again. This hotel is the Ikea bookcase you bought out of college, the James Blunt of your record collection; let me explain.  The hotel is about 30 minutes from the airport. We opted for the half board option and two bedroom guest suite to accommodate our two children (ages 5 and 3). The hotel is divided into two large towers (this is a large hotel). Tower two, and particularly the reception, is an unmanned area largely reminiscent of a New York subway station at midnight. The reception is just a drab dreary place that prioritizes utilitarian function over welcome luxury.   Here were our key observations  Ambiance …"
441,"While most of features were good (Location, Transportation, Service, etc.) I would like to mention that the facility is quite aging and the pool was under construction while I was staying.  BEWARE, The biggest problem was that I from time to time could NOT get hot water in the morning (bit late, like 8ish am) so ended up freezing myself in cold shower. I suspect the water supply was short on capacity to provide sufficient volume of hot water to all guests during busy times preparing for a day.  All the staffs were nice and helpful. Especially I would like to appreciate the gentleman at the front door for his help arranging the shuttle (free of charge from Mon to Fri) to Morumbi Corporate every morning. Just be careful about the commuting time, as the traffic in the morning is…"
442,"The room here was perfect - very well designed, spacious, quiet, very comfortable.  Good location.   The only flaw was that the lobby entrance lets in lots of cold air so even the lobby bar area was quite cold.  I don’t know how the reception staff tolerate it. Also note that the hotel restaurant only serves meat.  Not good for us vegetarians. You can get one or two vegetarian dishes from the lobby bar but the food there was underwhelming.   Hôtel Is very  close to the Emperor William Church"
443,"We just checked in for the first of our five night stay. The check in staff erroneously gave us a room with one bed, when we had reserved a room with two beds. after that was corrected, we discovered the wifi in our room was not working. After they rectified that issue, the real problem surfaced--the useless fridge. Because we are travelling with a baby, the fridge serves an important function for us to store her baby food. But the fridge temperature is ridiculously high, so unable to do its job in keeping the food fresh. I guess if you don't care about storing stuff in the fridge then this hotel is fine. The location is great, that's for sure. We sure hope the rest of trip turns out better than this disappointing first impression"
444,"Walking distance of all the central locations in Mitte - very conveniently located. Rooms are clean and tidy (yet strange layout of the bathroom with no walls). Small complaints are that no free water - €4-5 for a bottle of water in berlin, you have got to be kidding! Otherwise rooms are clean and tidy.              "
445,"I have been living in Brazil for 2,5 year and I have been traveling for buisness and leisure to Rio de Janeiro a number of times, since the first time this hotel seemed to be one of the preferred one by my company's colleague. The overall facility is very outdated and does not look fancy at all: rooms are of a decent size, but the bathrooms are just old and ugly; elevators lack maintenance and make squeaky noises and are often broken; breakfast quality, to be in Brazil, is below the average (fruits are especially poor) and today, 22.01.2015, the only nice facility of the hotel, which is the swimming pool, is simply closed for no special reason and they don't care even to let the clients know. The room insulation is quite poor as well: noises of water and from the street are…"
446,"I will start by saying the service was great, staff were super helpful and attentive. They assisted with anything we asked and had tons of suggestions of places to see and eat. The rooms were pretty old and beat up, they are clearly in need of some capital investment to fix them up. the hotel itself is in a beautiful location and close to everything. Lots of cool stuff in walking distance. The bar and restaurant looked nice although we didnt have time to try them. Again, very friendly service."
447,"Just stayed during a short trip to Berlin in the Mercure hotel. Actually the hotel facilities are quite nice and you have a good atmosphere in the bar and restaurant area. Especially in summer you can enjoy the backyard together with a nice drink. The rooms are a little bit old fashion, however in good condition and clean. The bathrooms are stylish and spacy. Once you arrived early, you have to be patient, since most of the rooms are only available from 14:00 onwards. The location is in the centre of Berlin with a big variety of restaurants. Either simple or fine dining. My perfect recommendation is the ""Entrecote"" but you are advised to make a reservation in advance since it is one of the hot spots. To spend a long weekend in Berlin, the Mercure hotel is in general good value…"
448,We are regular clients of this hotel. This hotel used to be excellent but has recently suffered from lack of investment in its infrastructure. Summary 1- Cleaning: good 2- Courtesy: good 3- Maintenance: poor 4- Breakfast: poor 5- Value for money: poor
449,"We were seeking refuge from San Francisco and surfed Ex___'s (the owner of this website) search engine to obtain lodging in Big Sur. We reserved a room at Ventana for $1000+ a night. I received a confirmation from Ex____ but Saturday morning on our drive down, we got a call from Ventana Hotel and were told that they didn't know how Ex__sold the room since the hotel had been  been sold out for weeks, but there happened to be a room available at their sister property, Carmel Valley Ranch. Did we want to try it? Our train had already left the station so we thought, what the heck? and resolved to stay at the lesser property, especially since the dog was in tow.  We checked in and was given a card guaranteeing the ""best available rate"" and the hotel desk clerk proclaimed we had been…"
450,"My friend and I had a mixed experience with a&o Amsterdam Zuidoost. On the positives, it was the cheapest place for us to stay and we didn't mind the location. It's about 20 minutes by Metro on an easy ride and it has plenty happening around it including the Arena and lots of shopping. An Ikea too, which was great for the €1/€3 breakfasts that the locals love as well.   About a quarter of our experiences with the staff were pleasant, the majority they weren't very friendly, and that might have to do with the constant streams of people this time of year - it's a very busy hostel and possibly the busiest I've encountered to date. We waited about 15 minutes for a check in and the queue was always long.   The lobby/ chill out area has no air-conditioning and because of the pizzas,…"
451,"This was not the best Ibis we have stayed in. the rooms were quite small and the bathroom even more so. the Hotel had a older feel to it. it is also quite a distance out of the City Center. The Bar in reception was quite nice and the Coffee and Croissants good. There is not a lot to see in this area but the price made up for it.  We used 48 Hour Travel Passes,12 Euro for our stay or 12 Hours for 7.50 Euro.  You can use bus 48(Contact weg or Cabel Weg) to get to the hotel from Train Station Sloterdijk (when arriving from the airport) or from the city center. There is also a Metro station close by but it does not run directly to the city center and we found the buses better."
452,"I really enjoyed my stay, my room was cleaned daily and had fresh towels everyday. There was a free mini bar with light refreshments in the room and it was refilled everyday, WOW!. The staffs at the reception during checking were very jovial and so were the breakfast staffs. The reception area offered free snacks and drinks all day round. The location is perfect with a lot of happenings. I highly recommend this hotel."
453,"The hotel is well placed and in a quiet part of the city. There are good restaurants within walking distance and a short walk to the tram, bus, underground and overground transport system made this the ideal location for our family visit. The hotel staff were extremely helpful and allowed us to store our suitcases in the hotel luggage store until late in the afternoon."
454,THIS PLACE IS A DUMP!!!  We saw the photos posted online and it seemed nice enough for a cheaper price.  Don't let looks deceive. This place looks original 1956. It is not Art Deco. It is just old And outdated.  When we tried to cancel or reservation the manager said if Expedia  would allow us to cancel then he would cancel it. But when Expedia called him he says he would not cancel it. there are much nicer places to stay along Lincon for not that much more. The room was noisy and creaky. also it is overpriced. And they charge extra for wifi and beach chairs. the only good thing is the location and the pool area is okay. but the pool is too hot to enjoy it. we have stayed at hostels when we were younger that were nicer than this. please reconsider your choice.  
455,"The hotel is in a neighborhood where a lot of graffiti on the walls, dirty, only couple showers on the hallway to share among all rooms.  We booked two queen beds room but they gave us the 1 queen bed room, I asked to exchange but the guy refused to change. Later I found out from him (he accidentally said it out loud) that my room reserved was given to the walk-in person before my arrival check-in.  The staff was super rude.  Please save your money for a better hotel.  You get what you paid for. Cheap = Terrible Hotel. "
456,"This is my first time here. I have stayed in better and cleaner hotel rooms. I think these rooms are over rated. Maybe because many celebs stay here, past reputation maybe, I don’t know. I have seen Marriotts and/ or less costly hotel rooms look better and where much cleaner than this. The rooms feel old and dingy. The rest of the hotel is nice, entertainment, food, nightlife. But the rooms get a 2 maybe a 3 out of 5. I am a hotel snob and the rooms make my vacation. This was not a hit to me."
457,"Sadly this is not a good review. There is definitely room for improvement. We were very disappointed with the service. It took us over 2 hours to check in, only because we wanted to stay an extra night. Then it was all downhill from there, 8 nights from a 5 star hotel, surely we should have been given fresh sheets during our stay?  Having said that the facilities were amazing but that was it. Was it value for money? I don't think so. It's such ashame, as the Water park was fantastic, but then during our stay, they decided to do maintenance on it after our 2nd day of arrival. In fairness,  if we had known in advance we probably wouldn't have booked to stay there. Overall a major disappointment for a holiday."
458,"We stayed here at this hotel for a week at the beginning of February. On checking in which was smooth we were shown to our room. On entering and seeing the small balcony we went and saw a (slight) sea view. We rang reception and explained that we had booked a sea view apartment. We were told that as this was a round building they could not guarantee a full sea view, we repeated what we had said earlier and were told that they would do what they could. Our initial thoughts were that we were being fobbed off.  10 minutes later we were told a porter would come and show us to a different room. As soon as we entered we could see a much larger balcony with a full sea view, which we had paid for. The apartment itself was very spacious but rather dated and in our opinion in need of a…"
459,"Well located, in a quiet street. Room was big enough , well isolated but depressing (colours, furnitures, bed,..). Very basic bathroom, low quality level of air conditioning. Safe, TV and watch were not working.Basic breakfast. I have not tested the restaurant with a nice terrace but even if I slept well for a very fair price I wdo not consider to come back"
460,"I came here last December with my partner and another couple and we had a lovely stay. The standard rooms are quite small but very clean and well furnished! Bathroom is lovely with powerful shower and again very clean!   Staff very friendly and had catered to my request of next door rooms with balcony's.  The spa facilities are really nice with the Turkish spa a peaceful area to relax. Great location within walking distance to a huge variety of pubs, restaurants and of course Christmas markets!  The bar is beautiful and intimate with a great range of wines and cocktails!"
462,"I accompanied my husband on business travel to Berlin.  I thought this location was perfect as he had his meetings right in the building and I was able to walk to all the attractions I wanted to see.  The room was spacious and clean but what stood out most for me was the breakfast service. The meeting my husband was attending has about 150 guests, many bring spouses so we meet each morning for breakfast and plan out our day.  The staff in the restaurant quickly caught on to our morning gathering, making sure we had a large enough table and rather than each of us going to get our morning mimosa they would bring a bottle of champagne to our table with a pitcher of orange juice.  They even brought us out a wonderful plate of chocolates one morning. Very pleasant stay!"
463,"The location is awesome, the staff will do just about anything to help you (Especially Mia and Ahmed), The rooms are clean and contain everything you need and the price is the best in Alexandrplatz.  Will definitely come back!"
464,"I stayed 2 nights in this hotel. The last day there was no TV signal and the telephone (to complain about the TV) was out of order. Also a lamp was failing. All in a 460 dollars per night suite. And the management did not give an adecuate respond. Not the IC's standards. During 2018 I've been in another IC Hotel's ... NY, London and Paris. The Intercontinental Chicago Miracle Mile is in a different league in comparision with other properties of the group. One last observation: when the Ambassador program promises ""in room mineral water"", the guest don't expect to visit daily the front desk and ask for water. Of course the complimentary pay TV film and daily newspaper is a joke at Chicago's Intercontinental."
466,"We didn't choose this hotel, it was booked as part of a tour package. The location is fantastic, just a block from Independence Square but that is where the good points end. We had an upgraded room on the 7th floor. The room was shabby and grubby looking and because of that felt unclean, although it wasn't dirty. The room had 2 double beds both pushed up against opposite walls so no matter which bed we chose one of us was sleeping against the wall. The walls themselves are paper thin. The first 2 nights of our stay we were woken by the sliding wardrobe doors in the adjacent room, on both occasions I thought someone was in our room at our wardrobe!! Breakfast is very basic with no hot food option. The city is so small and manageable, I would suggest avoiding this hotel, and…"
467,"I decided to take my kids to Chicago for the weekend. We decided to stay at the Peninsula based on reputation.  It's a big confusing as when you valet your car you have to take elevators up to the lobby and hotel registration was difficult to find.    During hotel check in, they attempted to upsell me to a higher cost room for only $450.00 What a bargain - we declined.  The bell and valet staff were nice, the hotel security was a bit over the top. They had a VIP staying at that hotel and we were asked several times to provide proof that we were staying at the hotel.  We were also followed by hotel security back to our room on one occasion.      My 13 year old daughter was pushed out of the way up against the tour bus by the VIP security team.  I am not sure how they are allowed…"
468,"This boutique hotel is really beautiful and I would strongly recommend for proximity to central Paris, comfort and great breakfast. Very modern, beautiful clean room with balcony. Very Parisian. Excellent customer service."
470,Great location and room. Wifi was patchy initially but all it took was a discussion with the front desk and it was rectified. Good value...great to have a kitchen. It was a shame that washing facilities are only available for a longer stay ( we were there for 4 days)
471,"Great atmosphere, staff are friendly and welcoming, suits younger groups and drinks and food are very reasonably priced. Located very close to eating spots nearby and the tram is just outside the hostel door. Would recommend "
472,"There are so many things wrong about this hotel. First, the service is horrendous. We went to the bar to have food many times and it would regularly take 45 min to 1 hr+ to get our food even when the bar was empty. My wife ordered espressos during breakfast several times over the course of the stay and they gave her coffee from the coffee pot and wouldn't admit they weren't espressos. I paid for a club room with lounge access. The lounge is laughable. The lounge itself is tiny, has no keycard access so anybody can enter it, and is not staffed 4 out of the 5 times we visited it. The food at the lounge is the leftover from the breakfast buffet. No alcoholic beverages were included. Only diet sodas. I was very disappointed and I voiced my concern to the front desk and was told that…"
473,This is my last ibis hotel if the service in the rooms not upgraded for the needs of 2019  When you spend money to a hotel expensive like as this you pretend that in the room you have the Basic things like kettle soup good towels and much more not only the room clean but still needs to be checked by the supervisor before other guests go’s in not to fined used towel  hidden behind the pillow extra  A swell the restaurant need to de upgrade the food  -Good things that was good the front desk staff was very helpful  -Internet was good  -The Mini market was good 
474,Very friendly Hotel. Excellent hotel very very good. Booked room for three exceptionally spacious and well equipped room fantastic bathroom and very helpfull staff. would definately recommend good location next to gare st lazare and close to metro.
475,"Not all of the hotel's staff are friendly and competent, they just do their jobs. Hotel needing a good renovation, elevators and reception completely dirty. I and several other clients have not had our room tidy, having to complain about a service that should be done without the client having to patronize for it. One morning I had a wonderful surprise during breakfast; a baby cockroach was looking around on the chaire beside me. Anyway, I would not recommend this place, but this is my own opinion."
476,"Hotel was nice, standard Holiday Inn 4 stars however if you are coming for a city break- the location is too far from city centre. It was taking us nearly over half an hour to get there by 2 tubes. However tubes are not reliable and on our visit trains broke down twice. It happened in a rush hour so traffic was stand still and it too us ages to get back!  Only advantage this hotel is close to the airport. We paid €20 to get taxi from airport and only €5.30 to get back by Uber! There is a bull ring in less than 5 mins walk. Downstairs there is a big shopping area. Only found out about it the last day! Also in the same building there are lots of God restaurants. We had our last meal in seafood restaurant Baia do Peixe. Food was amazing! Nice atmosphere, very reasonable and it's a…"
477,This charming hotel has so many pluses.  I am visiting with my new hubby and celebrating a landmark birthday and so really looked forward to a lovely stay.   We upgraded for a sea view to get a good room. On arrival the hotel then gave a further free upgrade to a bigger suite with a kitchenette. The staff are polite and charming.   They gave us a free bottle and a box of chocolates on my birthday which was really appreciated. On courtesy and thoughtfulness- this is 5 star.   The room is really lovely and big with stunning views.  The first disappointment here is the food. On my birthday we ordered room service breakfast. It was appalling. The continental breakfast was sparse and disappointing. We ordered other bits. The sausages tasted cheap and strange. The baked beans were not…
478,Very nice spacious room. Particularly liked the speaker in the en suite so you could listen to TV while you were in there. Only thing that could be improved would be an iron and ironing board in the room as standard.
480,"Great food, great people! Great hotel to stay if you visit Barcelona. Very closed to Rambla and other key points of Barcelona. Dario and Ferney are wonderful people. We really enjoy it! Just try to put more Information about the location of the hotel."
481,"It was a great place, we are older and really lived it, the bathroom was really nice with a huge tiled shower, it was very clean. Downstairs outside the bar was pretty loud that would be my only negative comment. I wish I could remember the guy at the front desks name, he was so helpful(it was a very unique name) . We would definitely stay here again. "
482,"My wife, father and I stayed here while in Buenos Aires last week.  The rate and location were great but it does come at a cost.  The bathrooms are worse than European ones (extremely small even for one person), the street noise is horrible and the walls of the hotel are paper thin that you can hear people talking in buildings next door and in the hotel hallway.  I was born in Buenos Aires and have visited plenty of times. I thought that the convenience of the location would outweigh things but with such a large transit system don't cheapen out and get a Nice Hotel Brand Like Hilton in Puerto Madero and avoid the hassle of a little over-rated place like this."
483,"I didn't like this hotel, although it could have potential. Rooms are very large sized and you couldn't say the furniture is cheap (very nice parwuet, indeed), but they somehow gave me a bad feeling. Everything in there is so dark, decorations, dim lights form the ceiling and not much sunlight from the windows. Bathroom was far too small if compared to the bedroom's size. And what's the point of a kitchen if I can't even see what I am cooking, because there's not enough light? And last but not least, I know you're trying to be minimalistic, but if you're trying too hard the result might be a gloomy feeling.   Pros: room size; decent cleanliness; central position; free wi-fi in every room Cons: too dark!; staff is unfriendly (or just apparently polite, but unwilling to help. But…"
485,"The hotel is almost perfect. Value for money. But if your neighbours shut the door of their rooms all the rooms are shaking, I woke up several times when this happened. My wall and my bed was also shaking. Hotel should maybe put a something on the doors to make them slower when closing...  But this is the only thing. The hotel is super."
486,"Very comfortable boutique hotel. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. Room is cozy. Central to Metro service and Montmartre. Great place to stay in Paris. There are some great bistros in walking distance, as well as the Sacre Coeur Church. We really loved the location.  "
487,"The hotel itself was very nice. Quite quirky and cute and we found it a great location as we are runners and wanted to be near Vondelpark.   However, we had some problems and mainly with the staff not the hotel itself. We stayed during the heatwave and arrived with a fan in our room which was great as there's no A/C. We left our room on our third day with the 'do not disturb' sign on and came back to find that someone had come in, gone across the entire room and taken the fan.  I went to ask for it back and they returned a fan within about 20 minutes. But, when we spoke to the staff to ask why it had been taken and who had taken it, they were quite rude and as the fan had been returned, they didn't see the issue that someone had come into our room when we had said not to. They…"
488,"This is a boutique hotel well located in the city centre. The Heritage Avenida Libertade is one of a collection of 5 small luxury hotels. It will take you less than 10 minutes on foot to get to the main attractions (Rossio, Chiado, Bairro Alto, Alfama, Praça do Comerciò) of the old city of Lisbon. Our room was beautiful, very clean and the air conditioning worked properly. The breakfast was good with superior quality offered, although the choice was not as wide as expected. Breakfast staff was friendly but little professional. On the other hand we found the staff very professional at the reception desk. The doorman was also nice and helpful. But this hotel suffers from a lack of human warmth! You are not recognised as a “special guest” even after 2 days which gives you the…"
489,"I've been coming to De Provence for many years, and I love coming back. There's always some improvement, always something new they thought of to m are things better. Love the welcome, and the sincere and warm care of the staff."
490,"furniture and cleaning of the room to be improved: old carpet , lysed towels , inefficient hair dryer,i stayed whit the family and i found a good breakfast and a confortable and clean bed .good location "
491,"Overall experience very good. The room was clean and comfortable, breakfast was great and the people very friendly. Much appreciated. I enjoyed my stay and would recommend it to all my friends. Thanks for everything, hope to see you soon"
492,"What a delightful hotel. Chic, spotless and lovely staff who gave privacy but were always on hand. The hotel Is within 15 mins walk of Pl de la Concorde, the Louvre and right on the tube to everything else. Thanks for a great stay I am sure we will be back. Ps if you want Paris chic this place will Work for you.  "
493,"This hotel does NOT advertise that there is an ongoing strike within the hotel. Let me tell you what this really means and why you should care:  1) Incessant noise all-day-round from striking people marching, shouting, and blasting sirens everywhere around the hotel, including right below your room.  2) Forget about sleep. They will wake you up all the time.  3) Inability to check in as late as 6pm due to shortage of clean rooms - with no clear ETA on when a room would be available.  4) Zero housekeeping services after check-in, no minibar.  5) Inability to enter or leave the property without being harassed by the strikers.  This hotel should NOT be allowed to sell rooms in its current state.  This is blatant theft at worst, and false advertising at best.  They charge a full…"
495,Great hotel. Nice cosy elegant style and atmosphere. Value for money. Rooms are beautiful decorated. All you need. Great Gym and spa area with a big pool. Ca. 18-20 long. Well equipped bar. Great Wine and Dine restaurant. Highly recommended. Serviceminded staff. Value for money. Location is good. Museums and attractions nearby. Will we be back? For sure! 
496,"The Hotel is located away from the Croissette. A nice walk down will take you to the beach in 10 minutes. The rooms are sunny, clean and quiet. The service is professional. This is a perfect 4 star hotel. "
497,"We stayed here for two nights and it was okay so to say. The hotel is clean, the front counter staff is a bit sloppy. Hotel is overall a bit outdated, but the price is good for a 5 Star hotel. It is very centrally located, which makes it easy for a city-stay."
498,"This was my first time visiting this hotel and my last. The hotel layout was unflattering and confusing. The front entrance is hidden next to the restaurant and the valet attended wasn't available when we arrive. We use the Hilton app to check in but when we arrive to our room on the 8th the digital key wasn't available, so we had to back down to the lobby to check in all over again. The room had a weird but very light urine smell, so we decided to leave the window open since it was only a one night stay. Also, found a red spot on one of the pillowcases, so we call the front desk and ask for more pillows and they need showed up. The next issue was the room safe which didn't work had to call the front desk to get it fix, but it took to long so we had to take all of our valuables…"
500,"Nice basic hotel. Clean room, nice staff. 5 minute walk to the U-bahn. Breakfast in the hotel, or next to metro station (3,50 €, bio company).  Parking at the hotel is tight but you should be able to fix it. "
501,There was a mold smell in the room and we wanted to change the room but the guy at the front desk told us there was no room available so I called booking.com about the issue and suddenly there was a room available. The guy at the front desk was not helpful. The last day we wanted a taxi to go to the airport and they told us they can not call any taxi. 
502,"Very friendly staff. Decent breakfast (more vegan options would be great!). Really good location, close to everything we wanted to see. Ireally liked the coffee machine in the room. This was a very pleasant stay!"
503,"Stayed here for four days during our European vacation. A great base to stay as it was in an area that was full of shops, restaurants & bars and also close to the airport and underground system. We were pleased when we arrived when they told us that they were going to upgrade us to an even better room than we had booked. We loved the room and it's facilities and decor. We would definitely come here again."
504,"Hotel is nicely situated just out of the hustle and bustle of the main centre and is off the touristy kind of path, 10min on the tram or a nice 30-45min walk through the streets from the central station.  The hotel was clean and functional, after staying in various Easy Hotels I knew what to expect in regards to room size and wasn't disappointed.    The Reception staff were very polite and accommodating with some useful information in regards to the surrounding area and also tourist hotspots.   Only gripe was the air conditioning/extractor fan (couldn't work out which) was programmed on an automatic timer which started around 6am and was loud enough to wake me and not allow me to go back to sleep. Speaking to the staff they said there wasn't anything they could do as its…"
506,"I have repeatedly complained that the internet is not working in my room (810). No WIFI available in my room for 3 days. When i checked out i was not requested how my stay was, although i complained many times. Really disapointed from not solving the problem as very important for me as necessary for work."
507,We arrived to a hotel undergoing a MAJOR renovation so our whole stay was in the middle of a construction zone. We should have been advised before paying the exhorbitant rates. And - there is no gym!!
508,"Me and my family stayed at this hotel. The hotel is beautiful and the waiters, waitresses and cleaners were amazing couldn’t fault them.  My main issue was the reception desk they were useless. We arrived to our room for it to be the wrong room. We had book a sea view room. The options when booking were a sea view, side sea view or garden view.  We had paid more for the sea view and had the side sea view so by 11:00 the sun had gone. And when I mentioned it to the lady from the reception who showed us to our room to go you can see the sea I felt was very unprofessional!!"
509,"At the check-in and check-out counter, snobbish and inexperience staff.      Because of the location and work  that's why I chose to stay there if not I believe there other better and cheaper hotels which can provide better services."
510,"I had a great experience here. It's a very good location near touristic places. I was in a female dormitory and it was clean and comfortable. The staff were really friendly and super helpful. They have a kitchen which is super useful if you are in a budget and are trying not to eat out. The kitchen facilities are good and well equipped and they even provide oil, salt, seasonings and napkins. I also saw that there were a washing machine and a drying machine though I must admit I never used them. "
511,"The hotel is a 17 minute bus ride away on the 128 bus. You can buy your ticket at a ticket machine outside the airport and validate the ticket at another machine next to the ticket machine. On our way back to the airport we bought our tickets on the bus from the bus driver. They were already validated when he printed them.   Check in and check out was quick and easy. The reception staff were friendly and efficient. The room was clean and quiet. We could hear the planes when we were awake, but they didn't disturb our sleep. Breakfast was delicious and there was a wide selection.   Rafael, the Portugese barman, who was working in the bar on Friday was wonderful. He was friendly and he made delicious cocktails. Unfortunately, Rafael had the night off on Saturday, A different barman…"
512,"This hotel is located in 2 minutes walk from the famous Las Ramblas.  Many tours start from Plaça de Catalunya, which is 7 minutes walking distance.  You can reach Mercado de La Boqueria from the side entrance (so you can avoid the overcrowded main entrance!).  Everyone needs to be buzzed in at the front door; we felt very safe here.  It's a 1-star hotel but amenities are those of the 3-star level, in my opinion. Our room had a balcony overlooking Carrer del Carme which is nice, but come nights, noise does not stop until wee hours (after all, Barcalona's night scene starts like 10 PM).  Also, I could feel the coils in my bed, and I was very uncomfortable.  Moreover, the shower doors did not shut tightly and made a mess the first day.  I since held my shower head to avoid…"
513,"Good and cosy Hotel in Berlin. We get there a real friendly Service and we can recommend this Hotel to others. Good Location and the (modern) Hotel was nice and cosy outfitted. Room was in a good middle Class Standard outfitted and we found there all was clean. Good Itmes at Breakfast, wich we did liked and it was tasty."
514,"Hotel was very Central located. Just near to metro, Paris Olry Bus. Hotel staff was very courteous and helpful. Nicolus was very forthcoming. Thanks for a wonderful stay. Room was good and comfortable. "
515,"The hotel was in a great location, the employees were courteous and friendly at all time, the breakfast was also good and we really felt great during our stay. We strongly recommend the hotel, it is a good choice for the money."
516,On my arrival after having no sleep for 36 hours we arrived at Amsterdam got into a taxi took us to the wrong hotel corden hotel has 3 hotels around Amsterdam Once we got to the right hotel we tried to check in but the receptionist was having none of it it was 10am in morning I asked if we could have room for a few hour to be told no go to town come back later Following day decided to have breakfast this was 15 euros each defiantly not worth it as cold sausages rock hard . We paid to use the spa facilities which was 15 euros each on our third day we went to use the spa to be informed that only laddies can use the spa between 12  5 so I went to reception as I was not told when we purchased them they told me to to come back later The following day checking out asked about refund…
517,Stayed at this Hotel for two nights. The staff was extremely friendly. The room was small but very clean and comfy. The breakfast area was crowded and we had to wait a little to get a table but I guess this happens when you go 20 mins before breakfast buffet finishes ;-) There was an underground and bus stations near by and also the major shops incl. the KaDeWe within walking distance.  I can really recommend this hotel and would stay here again.
518,"I've stayed at this hotel many times and I'm really starting to hate it. It's not by choice that I keep returning (it's my companies preferred hotel).  - the dinner buffet was horrendous. At 8pm almost all the dishes were empty... just a few dregs left behind.  - Lift call-buttons don't work properly on 11th floor... not exactly comforting.  - Huge queue for lifts at peak hours... it's a really poorly designed elevator system.  - Huge and outta control queue at checkout snaking all the way around the lobby making this place feel like a busy train station. - Room service food was disgusting — the ""Deep-fried prawns with Soy Sauce"" we're served at fridge temperature. Literally, even the bowl and plastic cling-film were about 4°C. Perhaps intentionally? Is this a cold dish? But I…"
519,"I like the hotel admosphere. The rooms are clean. But you must avoid the rooms in the basement, very noisy: in the evening when people are smoking outside, and in the morning with the traffic and the lugage wheels."
520,"The very helpful and enthusiastic staff, the view from the balcony in the dining area, the food, the location were all excellent. However, our room (15 - Max Ernst - Executive Deluxe Room) was a disappointment. The small marble-and-wood bathroom especially the sink area was very confining and poorly lit. The lighting was from BEHIND the mirror making it very difficult to change contacts, shave or apply make up. The walls are a dark brown (?) and contribute to the poor lighting. We informed the staff and they immediately brought up a floor lamp to assist with the lighting. Unfortunatley, the lamp took up precious space in an already small sink area. A classic case of art over functionality.  The wooden floor strips between the bathroom and bedroom were warped and creaked…"
522,"Great Location Clean Water/Tea/Coffee Machine Many supermarkets around, easy access to metro Lovely gesture on arrival of a bottle of wine to celebrate one of the girls getting engaged  Only reasons it did not get a 5 star rating is due to the fact the bathrooms were slightly run down and small... a few cracks in the bathtub showing orange rust .... and we requested an Iron but never received it.  Other than this it was a fantastic stay and I would definitely go back!"
523,"This hotel was super well-priced ($99 a night) the weekend before Thanksgiving so I stayed with family for a lovely weekend in Chicago. The location is great, central to everything you want, but the rest of the hotel is not.  First, the heat: the rooms seem to be super well-insulated, so my room was 78 degrees during my whole stay. I don’t know where the heat was coming from, but the hotel engineer said the heat was off and they can’t cool the rooms, so I just needed to deal with the heat. That doesn’t seem normal for a nice hotel chain, right?  Second, while I stayed they just never came to make up the room! When I called the concierge desk, the person there said the hotel was busy so “they can’t guarantee when or if the rooms would get made up.” Isn’t this a normal service at…"
525,"We arrived after a 15km hike as part of an organised walking tour. Our luggage awaited us in the lobby having been delivered by the tour organiser. My first surprise was that the hotel has no lift. Our room was on L1, one down from reception. As we are travelling for 7 weeks our bags are not light.  Once in our room we found that, whilst wifi is available free, it is limited to 2 devices per room. After logging on with phones we were unable to connect with tablets. When I attempted to telephone reception to sort the problem there was no answer. After climbing the stair to speak with the receptionist I found she was away from her desk chatting with kitchen staff and could not hear the phone.  On the positive side the food was good and the choices offered on our half board package…"
526,"Fantastic Location. Good quality fixtures and fittings.  Ample space in rooms, with Kitchenette was great.  Safe. Friendly. common areas like a hotel. Would stay at any Adina if they are all like this. Bar tender knew his Gin, as well. Always a good sign."
527,"Was in a room with 10 beds, the bed was comfortable, however the room was next to the outdoor smoking area making the room smell, and not only of cigarettes.  The showers were good, however the water on the floor creates a mirror, so the person next to me could see my reflection. Breakfast was nice and filling."
529,"Really Neat hotel with great service. The room is really clean. No need to worry about bed bugs, seriously. The wifi here is really strong, maybe in my room... Room was a bit small but isn't it all like that in Paris? Hotel was in a very safe area near the train station as well."
530,"The hotel is perfectly located in old town of Riga walking distance to anything.  The rooms are small, clean and unbearably noisy.  Bad music, thumping through the walls until five a.m.. The packs of ear plugs, that don't do the job.  Average brealkfast. The Wellton Hotel S.p.a. where we have been previously is definitely better and cheaper."
531,"I don't even know what I liked best! The modern design, new building, clean room, great refreshing bathroom, filling delicious breakfast, amazing coffee choices, great bar & people! The rooms are not very large but you'll have enough space for everything, specially if you choose it to crash for a few days on a busy city break! The shower it's really refreshing, towels & bedding are new and very clean! Breakfast is served in the reception area for 4 hours starting from 6.00 a.m during the week and 7 a.m on weekends! Brilliant!"
533,"Hotel is situated very close to Wittenbergplatz underground station which gives you an easy access to many places in the town by U-bahn (Untergrundbahn, underground). Also very close is one of the landmarks of Berlin, the famous KaDeWe department store.   The easiest way from the airport (Tegel) to the hotel is to first take a TXL bus to the Zoological Garden station and then transfer to U2 underground line towards Pankow. It is only one stop from Zoo. The day ticket for Berlin public transportation zones A and B (that gives you access to very large area) costs 7 euros and can be purchased using the automated ticketing machines at major bus stops (like the airport) and most U-bahn and S-bahn stations.  We arrived quite early but the clerk at the reception was very kind to gave…"
534,"This was our first visit to Lisbon and we were extremely pleased with our choice of hotel, excellent location, food and amenities.  However, this was spoilt by a text from my Bank (Barclays)  on our 2nd day letting me know that an attempt had been made by someone in Portugal, that day, to make an online purchase for over £500  using my debit card.  The Barclays Fraud dept had spotted this and stopped it, thankfully.  My cards were with me all the time, or in the room safe except for one day when I left them in my handbag in our locked hotel room and this was the day the fraud was attempted.  By process of elimination we believe it could only have been one of the housekeeping team.  We did report this to the Assistant Manager at the Hotel as soon as we found out and I did admit…"
535,One of the most overrated. Places We went to the RESTAURANT the manager was missing 10 minutes no one came to ask us or attend us  The buffet at 1800 INRis a rip off No food selection It seemed a collection of chepest  veggies in town or the left overs  Other 5 stad  hotels offer much better spread at  much better prices  Really a big let down
536,"My wife and I just returned from Barcelona ( 8/1/2018 ) and we stayed several days at the Hotel Praktik Rambla. The staff were terrific. Very helpful and professional. The location is about a five minute walk to the subways. There are two amazing Tapas restaurants within a few short blocks. The rooms were clean and the coffee/tea available 24 hrs a day. I really enjoyed my stay with them and would absolutely consider going back to this hotel. I've traveled around the world and would rate them highly. Negatives? Not really. I personally had issues with remaining connected to WiFi, but again they were very helpful in loaning me a remote WiFi box. I hope this helps other travelers who are considering this hotel."
537,"Enjoyed our stay at Aspasios Las Ramblas. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Rooms were nice but a bit cramped...especially the bathrooms. Location is just off of Las Ramblas and very close to a Gaudi attraction-Palau Guell. Locals are out late most nights so it can be noisy late. Washing machine, no dryer, but we simply hung things to dry while we were out and about. Recommend."
538,"On the very positive side, the location is superb and the apartment is really roomy, well equipped and secure, so would definitely recommend if you want to be at the heart of the city and don't mind street noise and a slightly shabby interior. And the service and support was great. We were on the first floor and there was an outside restaurant below both the lounge area and the main bedroom. Made for a lot of interest in the evening when we got back, and a decent set of earplugs meant a good nights sleep, so all manageable. The decoration was a bit tired once you got to the bathrooms and bedrooms, but clean. And only one bedroom had air con - okay in September with a fan, but probably a bit uncomfortable in the heat of the summer. So, shabby chic in a noisy location, but a great…"
540,"I’d like to start off saying that the staff is very friendly and sweet. They get those 2 stars. Unfortunately I can’t say the same about pretty much every aspect of this resort. The price per night is expensive. Everyone knows that going into staying here. But with the high price of this hotel plus a resort fee, you’d think that you would be getting a good product. “You get what you pay for” right? That’s just not the case with Turtle Bay. The bed was incredibly lumpy and the pillow was the same way making sleep uncomfortable. The food is bland and so incredibly overpriced (breakfast items being over $20, dinner entrees being over $30. How can watered down pineapple juice cost $7?!)   When going to the beach, there is a towel hut, which is very convenient. But you have to pay…"
541,The hotel staff were hands down the friendliest and most welcoming staff!! Room and bathroom both a good size and exceptionally clean. Metro stop is a very short walk away even though it was a bit crazy trying to do the metro in a wheelchair. Monoprix at the end of the street so great for getting lunch and heading out for a day seeing the city. Hotel is in a quiet safe area. Great Korean restaurant a few streets away called Sodam. Would I stay again? Without a doubt! 
543,"Fabulous hotel near to Hauptbanhof train station, central for everything, nice bar, friendly staff, immaculate trendy rooms (rooms on the small side but perfect for a few days), great shower too! Absolutely no complaints, good price and great service."
544,"Stepping away from the boring old hotels, this is a refreshing and vibrant spot that makes you feel at home. Everything seems brand new and clean with a well laid out open plan foyer and dining area. Its only a few minutes walk from Berlin Ostbahnhof (East train station) so travelling to and from is made easy. The rooms are a little small but clean and have everything you need. The shower is great. The staff make the hotel feel like a friendly hostel-type social environment. They are super friendly, well informed and there to help. "
545,"Very last minute I had to fly across the country as my daughter-in-law went into labor 3 weeks early and I was visiting in Atlanta. I contacted this hotel as it was suggested to me as the closest to the hospital. Initially I was told they had no availability but when I asked if they could recommend something nearby I was told they would in fact be able to accommodate me. I was very relieved but mistakenly in all of the craziness didn't ask the rate. I ended up not arriving to the hotel until almost 2am and was told they had canceled my reservation even though I informed them I was arriving late, after midnight. I was then informed that the rate they were going to charge me for the night of 10/22 was $499!!!!! but the rate for the 23rd which was technically when I was checking in…"
546,I’m a platinum Hilton honors and this must be the worse Hilton in America.    My room was lodged behind an elevator which made noise all night and wasn’t close to any standard of clean.   Why bother to be a Hilton honors member?
547,"Nice staff, good internet, common room was ok. Close enough to walk to most things if you like walking. Other travelers seemed nice, felt a little hard to connect maybe because of the space or because of the travelers there at the time. "
548,"I have been to many hotels in my traveling around thw world.  This hotel was a mess. Upfront rude staff at the check in I mean right off the bat a bas start.  I was given a room ""that was used and not cleaned"" so I had to go back to the check in.  Rooms are very small and looks like a in and out kind of hotel if you know what I mean.  Its far away fron the city.  I would only stay here if I need to be close to the airport. "
549,"Last minute booking as a result of a terrible hotel we had booked into and out of immediately. The staff at Indigo (Dennis in particular) were very helpful and accommodating. We would have liked to stay longer but the hotel was fully booked. The room was small, clean and comfortable. Had toiletries, safe & fridge and a great shower. Yes there were ear plugs as mentioned by other guest but we did not need to use them, some noise but found it reasonably quiet. Restaurant was very good, book if you want to dine there. Central location for shops, restaurants, train station. Would stay again and we do recommend this hotel."
550,"Catalonia is a very nice hotel with big rooms and high standard. Good breakfast and a nice restaurant for an easy meal in the evening. Can´t say much about the location, was coming in and out with taxi."
551,Facility is ok but staff both rude and inattentive to guests.  Had multiple issues with the staff from the time they picked me up at the airport with the wrong name on the sign.  No special privledges for high status members of the Hilton rewards program either.  Front desk showed NO guest skills...many people in line and they just ignored us and talked amongst themselves.
552,"First: Oia, how beautiful this place is - it's just overpriced! Hotel, Restaurant, Shopping... your money runs away. The staff in Nostos was very helpful, they carried our baggage the hole stairs to our room. The view, like everywhere else in Oia, is just spectacular. My critic's are the following. It is not a very clean place. We had some spots on the bedcovering and the pillows, which you could wash out - but it looks that they didn't. We had our little terasse, but the floor outside was quite dirty. Just a quick wipe whit a brush would be nice- and so you wound get dirty feet's when your barefoot. In the bathroom (tiny, smelly, dark) we had some hairs from the last guest. For the price of 300 Euro per night, I except in minimum cleanliness. The breakfast is quite simple, not…"
553,"Perfectly fine hotel, but of the basic, budget model. The rooms are comfortable with decent bathrooms. All very clean and tidy (bathroom towels were perfectly clean but really worn). This is a classic business hotel during the week with a younger crowd at weekends, wanting a cheaper hotel and willing to travel on the metro to get into Amsterdam. Of course, if you're here for the Ajax stadium, then it's perfect. I was on a business trip with the client next door, so it was convenient. The staff is excellent, and very friendly and helpful, and it's only 18 minutes from the Amsterdam Central train station, and an amazing 15 minutes by train to Schipol Airport. 5 stars for staff and location, but overriding 3 for category. Only breakfast available, with snacks and booze at other…"
554,"The Lobby is modern,but the service is not recomendable! I was traveling with my friend and we requested a room with a twin bed.even though the Hotel wasn't full,they didn't give it to us or            only with a charge of 30.-€ per day. The rooms are modern,but very small.We were on the 3.flor and looked against the wall of the house on the other side. We could hear everything that was spoken in the narrow street below. The bathroom-wall isn't closed,so if you go in the bathroom,the other Person is disturbed by the light and the noise. We asked for a wake-up call and it came 40 minutes late. If we wouldn't have set our cell-pones,we would have lost our flight. The receptionist excused herself, but that doesn't help much. The Restaurant closes early at night ,even if in…"
556,"We bought into this timeshare when this was an Embassy Suites property. It was such a fun place! Lots of families, plenty of things to do, and great amenities.  Then it was sold. A LOT of things changed, and not one for the better. We have returned here for 13 of the 16 years since we purchased. For those who have never been here before, you will not ever know how it used to be, so you will still think it's ok. But now it is predominantly the older crowd that comes here. My late teenage kids can't believe there isn't anyone their age here anymore. The vibe is very quiet and old feeling. If that's what you want, definitely come here. If you want a little fun, check out something like the Hyatt. We stayed there last month, and I will be writing their review next.  Finally, to top…"
557,We stayed at the Novotel again for our annual Christmas market tour of Berlin. The rooms are simple and I wish they had better room service after 10pm but otherwise are fine. They could do with some tlc as they appear to be wearing. The breakfast in the hotel is fantastic. I highly recommend the meatballs :) 
558,After booking online we arrived at embassy suites at 3:30 stood in line 20 minutes just to find out we couldn’t get a room as Loyola had booked the rooms for a convention. We didn’t get a room until 6:45pm and check in was supposed to be 3:00pm. We made reservations for dinner at 7:00pm earlier in the day for our anniversary and of course we missed  Our reservation. The staff was more concerned with signing us up for the rewards program than addressing our needs. My question is... if you booked the hotel with late check outs (which I’m sure they paid for) why did you show available rooms when we booked online? Unfortunately the late check in and attitude Overshadowed any positive comments. 
560,"Loving this hotel. This is my third time I stayed in this hotel for its location and the friendly staff, the breakfast. I prefer to stay in rooms overlooking the street and that what I always get. Many thanks to everyone working at the hotel."
561,Very small breakfast area. Always (except early morning) overcrowded. Very small tables even for 2 persons.   Nice and helpful staff  Location is excellent. You are in middle of best Berlin shopping area.
562,"This hotel was a dissapointment.  The room was worn and tired.  The other hotels we stayed in had nice large rooms, this was almost smaller than a typical Eurpean hotel. Not as clean as we thought it should. The restaurant was excellent. Great location, not sure that there is a room with a decent view in the building."
563,"Movenpick hotel offers nicely decorated rooms at 10 minutes walk from Potsdamer Platz. Luxurious furbishing all over the place. However, housekeeping is lousy: my used glass and cup had been put back in the minibar without washing them up."
564,"It is a truely lovely hotel, uniquely decerated  with a very friendly and helpful staff. Very clean. The bathroom is on the small side, but manageable once you get used to it. Would definitely recommend it."
565,"The hostel is great with lots of facilities. Love that the bar is open till 3am and you can still sit there after that if you want. Small kitchen, but everything you need. Pizza at the bar is genuinely the worst I've ever had in my life, and the staff were disappointing with their lack of knowledge of the city. I asked 6 separate staff if they could recommend a bar.... not one of them could name even 1 for us to go visit in the evening. A Dutch staff member couldn't tell me how to buy a train ticket online....... as if I'm the first traveller to ask. When we checked in, we asked if they had any events for xmas e.g. a dinner. The staff all said no, so we made other plans, just to find out that they once again lacked any kind of knowledge and there was a dinner...... Disappointing that there's no free place to store luggage after checkout - we left our stuff in the room and the staff member told us ""you'll be lucky if your stuff is still there as the cleaners remove all bags from the room"" when we went to collect it. A blatant lie, and quite aggressive.…"
566,"Well located close to the U-Bahn station and central shopping areas the  Mercure Hotel seemed as a good place to stay for 3 nights. I was satisfied with the room, check in and service was quick and hassle free and breakfast was good, even if I would have minded a better selection of whole grain Brötchen from a local bakery (not prepared industrial ones!). Interesting selection of good German wines by the glass in the bar was a plus as well."
567,"I must say, after reading all of the responses to customer reviews by the management (and Arnott's responds to EVERY review here), I am even more disappointed by this establishment. We stayed here twice in May 2013. The staff were a bit arrogant (just like the review responses are) and one of them actually told me we would get air conditioning on our second night and we did not get a room with it.   The rooms are expensive for the Big Island. You are paying 75 dollars for two people to share an apartment-type room without air conditioning. Very noisy overall as well. The bed was a board with the thinnest mattress you can imagine. I had to put the duvet under the mattress to make sure my hips weren't hitting wood underneath. We found better accommodations for less in Waikiki…"
568,A nice large well serviced 2 bed apartment I would have given more stars but for a couple of issues. Main issue being that our party was only given 1 set of keys when asked if we could have another set were told no which was inconvenient. Cleaning of the apartment was great again massively let down by the really grubby graffitied communal areas. Despite this we would stay again just have more than one set of keys. 
569,"Room uncoordinated with closet located in the bathroom, this is a big problem.  Air conditioning not very effective as it is the old style water chiller type.  Non smoking rules in rooms not enforced. Valet parking is mandatory at 29.00 per night.  Vehicle retrieval can take up to 10 minutes during morning and evening hours.  Hotel is difficult to get to due to one way streets and constant heavy traffic in Waikiki.  Views of the beach are obstructed by building as is the view of the mountains in the back"
571,"The location of this hotel is so excellent that I even forgive them for not having great WiFi. Rooms are spacious and clean, the front desk staff is very helpful and the price is right. You don’t swim in luxury here but you have what you need: a very clean and quiet room in a lively, fun and convenient neighborhood "
572,The hotel was located in a perfect corner walking distance from Champs-Elysées. Quiet hotel with friendly staff. The only thing was that the breakfast was a bit expensive for the standard everything else was perfect.
573,"This was my first trip to Brazil and my colleagues booked this hotel for me. I should have intervened. The room was small, hardly enough space to open my baggage. Essentially no view of the city, dirty windows, lousy curtains to shut out the light. The bed was good. The pool deserted, the fitness room small and equipped with aged stuff, some damaged, the 'sauna' far below average, tiny, small benches, the showers lousy. No window. The restaurant was sub standard, the quality of the food below average, the hotel bar (if you want to call the assembly of chairs and tables below the staircase so) closes at 11 pm. Province. No flair to speak of, the reception desk only halfway capable to speak English. No, I will never stay there again."
574,Fantastic hotel with friendly helpful staff - excellent infinity swimming pool and rooftop jacuzzi - cleanliness of hotel in 100% - nice quiet location with lovely views.  We had a junir suite with outside terrace which was brilliant.
575,"We didn't stay at the geusthouse. Only booked a boat tour ftom miss Han. We paid 1000000 Dong for 2 which is double the price of other tours. It was during Tet so there were no float markets open, so we just went with the noat for a few hours. No complaints about the boat dtiver and the guide, they were ok just the price irtitates me."
576,"The hotel was modern and very clean. It has spacious rooms and new furniture, but there is no heating. For us it was a bit too cold in the room. The pillows are indeed too big, so I've slept on the small pillow that was for design on the chair :). The double beds are two single put together. I am a light sleeper so I heard airplanes taking off or landing every single day (I woke up around 6 o'clock ). So, even though, it seems like a quiet area, keep in mind the airplanes. The breakfast was basic but OK. There was a Jumbo supermarket right next to the hotel. The staff was excellent. The hotel is situated 30 minutes from Amsterdam Central Station and city center, but the trip is pleasant. We recommend the tram 5 for getting from the AMS Central to the hotel and not the subway…"
577,"Stayed here just for one night in May but didn't really enjoy my stay.   I tried to negotiate a better rate and get a long stay discount but the receptionist wouldn't come down on price because apparently it was already discounted at 140,000 per person for a dorm. I wanted to stay here for a total of 4 nights but instead I got a better deal elsewhere.   I didn't like the atmosphere in the hostel too much, they played really loud pop ballard type music in the reception which was really annoying while eating your breakfast.   There was no socialising between other guests which made this place really boring. The staff would huddle up and talk between themselves behind the counter.   The bed was comfy and practical though. You have a blind to your bed, a locker and a shelf. "
579,"I found this hotel quite expensive for what you get. Service is just ok, and location is fine (walking distance from the airport in Lisbon - not inside the airport). I've stayed a while ago with Sheraton inside the airport in milan, top superior quality, five star hotel and paid less 30% for a deluxe bedroom with king size bed.  Here, the tryp airport has very comfortable beds, and rooms are built to protect you from the airport sounds (never heard a plane during my short stay).  At arrival, big mess with my reservation, but after a while everything was sorted out. Great thing is their breakfast, for early flights, starting at 4AM. Buffett dinner is very poor. No privacy for toilet, be advised.  I wouldn't stay here again, unless I have a very early flight, before 7AM.…"
581,My husband and I stayed here for 1 night before leaving to go back home after spending time in different locations in California for vacation. We stayed at the Stanford Court because I had stayed there some 35 years ago. So for nostalgic reasons we booked our room. The staff was very nice and helpful. When we got to our room I was shocked. The room was very small. It was maybe 15 x 12. The bed was queen size. There was a tiny round table with 1 small chair. There were 2 nightstands and 2 other pieces of furniture. The room was $275 for the night plus $52 a night for valet parking. I've stayed in major cities before and live near a major city. This was just not worth the money. And charging $52 a night for valet parking is just taking advantage of guests.
583,"I was really pleased when I arrived as the hotel is clean and the rooms pleasant enough.  However speaking to anyone in this hotel if you didn't speak Portuguese was a trial.  Trying to order room service after a long day working was almost impossible.  I was put on hold 4 times, and eventually put the phone down and rang the front desk.  They also didn't speak good English and the trial continued for a further 5 minutes.  Even the request to make a complaint was misunderstood / deliberately ignored??  I will see if my meal ever turns up, but this is not an international hotel!"
584,Small rooms but beautiful. I had a small balcony with street view. Clean and quiet hotel that  has all you need. Very close to shops and restaurants. The staff was very friendly. The breakfast is very international. 
585,"Beach location is beautiful but hotel room is not kept that clean.  The floors are dirty and bathroom looks like it needs a mop. We love to travel and have a 10 and 8 year old.  It is nice ot have a small fridge and microwave to keep food costs down.  It is a wet bar set up; everything is in the same room. We have never experienced this before but were told that we could ONLY HAVE 4 towels a day for the beach/pool.  Unfortuantely, one towel is never long enough to cover a lounge chair by the pool so you have to sit on any dirt that is not covered by one towel.  Seems unreasonable to me and something we have never experienced before.  I called to complain and was told I could have another towel BUT one towel per person a day is still their policy.  Not very accomodating. We also…"
586,"Rooms are ok, decent size, good beds. Main problem with this hotel is the location, as it is about 30 min walk from the main downtown of Hue where you find most of the restaurants. Located on a busy street near the train station, the rooms are not really soundproof.  Breakfast is average, and staff are neglecting their business. Wouldn't recommend staying there."
587,"My wife and I stayed 1/2 a day and decided at around 7pm to check-out and return to another resort, at significant extra expense.  So I guess you can tell by my rating and this one sentence that our stay was not perfect, or in keeping with the majority of other reviewers of this resort.  My wife, 9 month old daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed the service from the staff.  They were friendly, proactive and attentive.  Exactly what you are after at a small family operated resort.  The owner introduced himself and was happy to engage wth us and other guests, which was very nice.  What caused us to decide to check-out, after only around 6 hours of being at Cassia Cottage was the state of the mosquitoes inside the guest room.  The resort does not spray (fog) for mosquitoes around the…"
589,"Let me start that this hotel has a great price for value. It is in the hippest area of the city and on top of the subway which can bring you downtown in a few minutes.  First the pro's:  - Design is cool. Has this urban vintage look and feel everywhere and has small surprise design elements which make you smile. Can't be found at other hotels. - Rooms are very clean and comfortable. Yes you do hear the traffic but don't forget the value for money you get at this hotel. AC works well and the corner room i stayed in provided enough space. - The hotel provides a very pleasant energy while sitting in the lobby.  Con's - The staff. I read a lot of reviews from people being very positive about the staff. This was not my experience. I have not seen them smiling, being pro-active or…"
590,"Nice enough hotel but the valet damaged my rental car getting it from the parking lot and although the Security Manager wrote a letter for me at the time confirming the incident the hotel (and SPG Platinum) have subsequently ignored me, leaving it to me to pay the insurance excess to the rental car company.  Worst customer service I have ever seen."
591,"Room:   I booked a Grand Suite with 1 King Bed 431-sq-foot (40-sq-meter) room with river views & my room is 701. They have 10 floor total.  However, the accactual room size is not correct. It is around  320 sq foot only I did measurement by my self when I stayed there. The view is nice if you can get a higher floor.   I gave only 2 starts because the room 401 was dirty when I check in at 10 pm. I asked to clean & change another room because I saw many long hair on the bed and the bed sheet was not clean. They did not change a room until next day. I could not sleep the1st night.  I do have a picture of you want to know more.   Food:  It is very basicfood service and another review are correct. Food for breakfast is limited and not much because of small hotel so they don’t have…"
592,"I loved the hotel and location. It would have been perfect... However, on the first day of my trip I was charged over $3,000 for 5 nights that were supposed to cost $850. The woman at the front desk “accidentally” ran my card multiple times. After 6 conversations with management and 2 calls to my bank, they removed the charges. When I asked how they were going to compensate me for their issues the manager told me “well we resolved the issue.” Ridiculous. "
593,"I’ve stayed at several Marriotts before, this one was unlike the rest. After housekeeping took my phone charger, nobody owned up to it and the front desk staff just shoulder shrugged when I asked them what they could do to alleviate the situation. They said I could just use the free charging station in the lobby, didn’t offer to replace my charger. The whole reason housekeeping was in our room in the first place was because at the time of our 9:30 PM check-in, the last visitors’ trash/sheets still hadn’t been cleaned up. So we were not able to enjoy our room until 11:00. It’s one thing to make mistakes as a hotel, but when you do nothing to fix the problem and don’t make it up to the guest, that is how you lose customers. Very poor service compared to other Marriot locations…"
594,"My sisters and I went to he Ice Kube Bar for birthday drinks and this was our second visit to the hotel.  Soufyane greeted us like we had just left him the night before.  We went to the Ice bar which is very good value for money since you get 2 cocktails and one shooter for €25. The lovely barmen give you a puffy jacket to keep warm in the freezing bar, and you get about 20-25 mins in there with good music, only the people from your party (it’s not like you queue for a drink or anything, the barmen are there just with you and your friends, which makes for a nice private time).  We’ll definitely be back again, and hope to see Soufyane one more time!!"
595,"I know that I have to put down my expectations when I compare hotels in Rio with other hotels in the world, but when I arrived my expectations didn’t come close   As I booked a suite with overlooking the Copacabana I did had a big room and a real nice view, but then it started..  the room was renovated but still very dated, a fake wooden floor and and furniture partly ripped and molded  Even basics things where missing , for a 4-5 star hotel a no-go - no hangers in wardrobe to hang your clothes  - no spoons for the coffee ( just plastic sticks) - no bottle opener  - no ashtray on the balcony  - no”don’t disturb “ sign for the door - no iron  - no pencil or block note - no side table on the balcony or a sun bed  Basic things even a 3 star hotel normally has  The bathroom was ok…"
596,"We stayed here for four nights. it's a nice city hotel and the location is ideal. The staff were very nice and the room was clean. Although the hotel is in the busy city centre, the rooms are very quiet. Our room was very small and cramped. When we got home we found out that we had booked and paid for an Superior room but were given a Standard room. I don't think this was intentional but check your booking when you get your room. The safe in the room is a bit of a joke because it can be picked up and carried out. But all in all I would recommend this hotel if you are in Lissabon for a few days."
597,"It’s VINTAGE! Yes... 5 stars...! But, vintage, ok? Do you know what it means? If yes, great!! Go for it! Excellent bed and pillows! Beautiful , beautiful view( at least from my room 506!)! Very good staff, good service! Attentive personnel! Congratulations!! It seemed totally booked and they handled it well!👏🏻  The area it’ s located , is busy! Very busy! ( keep that in mind if you aren’t very keen on this intense “ life” ) The isolation is perfect and it makes you to relax.  But what it”is important to learn is that , if you have a car... too bad! Cars aren’t allowed to enter in that.     Pay attention!!! Parking is close but  complicated AND pretty  expensive  As well. If you have a taxi , you in better "
598,The hotel is located centrally........ the room was big enough to accommodate the 4 of us. The sofa cum bed was big and comfortable.  The breakfast spread was good but there is room for improvement..... overall very satisfied with my stay.
600,Good service at the reception. Fast and nice. Very good food (breakfast) with great choices of juices (orange and carrot are the best). Major problem is lwaking ceiling in my room. Room service knew about it yet the they did nothing.
601,"All was perfect and concierge was so nice, don't remember his name but slim and speaks good English. Very nice location, clean and nice smell rooms. Nice breakfast as well. Very good service at reception always."
602,"The location near Alexanderplatz is great. The hotel is about 200 meters from the metro and urban trains statios. Its also a very central location. The hotel is basic but very clean, functional and confortable. The breakfast is also very good with a good range of options to eat. The staff is kind and helpful. "
603,"Perfect location (next to the S-Bahn station, good surpermarkets neaby), services were great (especially the whaing machines which are quiet convenient) and the rooms are both clean and well equipped. "
604,"Staid there one night. We arrived a bit earlier than the official check-in time and the clerk refused to give us a room until the official check-in time, first time in my life! Usually hotels give you the room if available or speed up the availability of a room for a waiting customer, especially if with kids.  Well, finally we did get the room, the room floors show the age, the carpets are discolored and show the years of usage.  We did use the restaurant to have lunch while waiting for the room and we were happy with the restaurant food and service.  The room is very small for a family of 4, once you open the sofa bed there is practically no more room to walk!"
605,"This lodge is HIGHLY overpriced for the accommodations.  While they are on a wonderful site, directly lakefront, the rooms have NO air conditioning.  Our room had old dirty windows that did not open easily, and some had no screens on them, allowing bugs to come in the room.  We could not enjoy the view of the lake as our balcony was infested with bees.  While the rooms have had minor improvements with paint and carpet - the sinks are old, stained and cracked.  The exterior hallways have wood rot and uneven surfaces to walk on.  If you stay on a Sunday night, be prepared to get woke up by the trash trucks at 5:30 a.m. due to the facility being in the back of a strip mall.  Highly overpriced for what you get.  We canceled our stay after one night and moved over to the beautiful…"
606,"Great staff! Rooms are TOO small, poor layout, bathroom inefficient and small, upper sleep areas too close to ceiling and loud with guests above. Great area of the city! Again, staff were fantastic and helpful!"
607,"Firstly, I was informed TWICE by Jet2 Holidays that, although some work would still be ongoing during our stay, it would be no more than superficial (eg painting of some upper floor rooms).  That was not the case.  There was occasional hammering, drilling, power sawing and use of one of the two elevators by tradesmen who ""reserved"" it for their own use by blocking open one of the doors with a wardrobe door panel.  On to the hotel itself.  Access was directly on to a pavement, which is good or bad depending upon your view; in our case it was useful.  The reception staff was better than average and helpful.  The studio room we had, including kitchen area and bathroom, was adequate and furnished to a basic 3-star standard (needs updating), but the beds and pillows were very…"
608,"Yikes. The service in this hotel is beyond horrible. I stayed here with my family this week. The staff was unhelpful and rude in every respect. During breakfast every morning, the staff would pick up the entirety of the place setting every time anyone got up from the table. Mind you, everything else was still there - their jacket on the chair, the rest of their party. I stopped getting up from the table after the third day. I fear I will have PTSD from the breakfasts here. "
609,"The title of my review should not imply that I had low expectations for this hotel. However, I was still positively impressed after my two-night stay.  I was in Cannes for a wedding, and really just looking for a functional and good value hotel. Okko Hotel was perfect for that, and considering this was June in Cannes (a week or so after the film festival), the rates were very good (€115 per night).  The hotel seems to be fairly new, and the interior & rooms are very modern and trendy. My single room was on the smaller end of the spectrum but very modern, sleek, and functional. Wifi works well, there is a Nespresso-type coffee maker, the bed was large and comfortable, and the flatscreen TV had a decent selection of channels. The bathroom was also small, but everything works well.…"
610,"What a gem the Hotel de Flore is. The rooms are on the small side but that’s the majority of hotels in this area. Immaculately clean and well presented, a small range of toiletries, friendly staff, free wifi, fresh towels everyday and within walking distance of Moulin Rouge and the metro train station (not Gard Nord - the main station - we caught a cab from there). Plenty of little cafes nearby. This is the perfect place if you’re on a budget but still looking for something nice. We wished it had tea and coffee making in the room but totally understand it’s a bit too small to be fitting this extra in. Laundromat directly across the road. 24 hour Reception. You’ll need to be buzzed in if late (we came in one morning at about 1.30am and just hit the buzzer). Air con if required -…"
611,Staff was great but no one could get the wifi to work in my room and that's an issue when your international. The shower head was just sticking out of the wall and looked like someone had just ripped it halfway down. 
612,"Good service and comfortable stay. Hospitality   indeed good. Food good. Clean place to stay in Trivandrum Health club bad . Hotel was new when I stayed so it was a clean and new fresh rooms and decor. Well definitely good for business people, not a a holiday hotel for families."
613,"We had 3 night stay.... very comfortable,quiet room,ultra modern interiors....dark,but no complaints. We had drinks once & didn't eat  there...menu over priced & weird selection to eat!! However,the Hotel Receptionists were very friendly."
614,"We went there with our kids.. The hotel is Chic, rooms are neat and clean. It has a Great location near for sightseeing tour bus and metro ..Their breakfast is excellent and the staff is friendly... We all enjoyed our stay"
615,"One room for 2 people costed 47eur, it is usual price in Berlin. It is hard to find room for 2 people for cheeper price. It is located near the city center, 7-10min walking from Reichstag. Room has everything you need: clean bathroom (shampoo, hair dryer etc), tv, fast wi-fi. Service was ok."
616,"2 grand for 2 nights - everything was average at best. Service slow and lacking, especially at river farm. 8 people standing round doing nothing while there's a line of 10 people waiting to get served. If it was half the price maybe, but it's a total con"
617,"This was my second stay in this hotel and I was not disappointed.  Paris was hot this time of year and the air conditioner in my original room didn't seem to work.  I made the staff aware of the problem and as soon as an alternate room was available they facilitated my move.  I like the second room better, it was cooler and additionally it was on the second floor which meant using the stairs was very convenient.  The elevators are slow and small, but that is to be expected.  Previously I had stayed in a hotel in a different part of Paris and there was only walkup which was a challenge due to my health and physical limitations.  The bed was comfortable, and the toilet/shower facilities were excellent.  All told this was my 5 trip to Paris and this hotel is the best one I have…"
618,"We stayed here on two separate occasions at either end of our trip to Milos. The location of the hotel is great - just outside the old town in Oia. There are no views of the caldera but you can see the sea on the other side of the island from the lovely pool and some of the rooms. The hotel was perfectly fine, and the rooms had comfy beds and a little kitchenette which was very handy. We also got given a free bottle of local wine with our room. We didn't eat in the restaurant except for breakfast. A bit more flexibility could have made our stay much more relaxed. As an example the hotel requires you to specify the day before what time you want breakfast, and what you want to eat, even if you are eating in the restaurant. It wasn't a big deal, but it made our stay less relaxing…"
619,"This is my third time staying at Turtle Bay Resort in five years.  Service was great but food was just okay as usual.  I am very disappointed that self parking is no longer covered under the Resort Fee (which offers no other value by the way...)   In previous visits, I could tolerate by telling myself that pays for the parking.  But recently (I think in March 2018), they all of a sudden found this new revenue stream.  It's the same parking lot that opens to the public for god sake!  That's enough!!  From now on, I will stick with Maui Wailea which offers more attractive activities, nicer beaches, newer hotel, much better service and food options at comparable price."
620,"Overall, our experience wasn't too good at Turtle Bay. Perhaps the most expensive resort we stayed at and we didn't feel that we received the value.   I am most concerned about the misc. charges in the resort fee and lack of value provided in it.  See the photo for all resort fee related charges, which is on top of hotel room + taxes.  Here are the concerns.  1) Turtle bay foundation - The hotel doesn't even check with the customer and charge this amount to customer without getting their consent. Upon further checking, this amount goes towards the education of high school kids. While the amount is only $1, it seems unfair to not even ask customers about this   2) Resort fee ($46) - They mentioned that it covers GoPro usage for 24 hours. However, there is a catch there .. you…"
621,"Nice spacious apartment which was great for our two families meeting up. You don't see the picture of the train line you are next to but this didn't;t bother us noise-wise. Balcony is covered, not quite was I was expecting. Poor to non-existent internet (which will apparently be fixed). Nice pub next door and the kids loved the little playground and basketball practice area."
622,"I stayed 3 nights on ""second"" floor, room 210, and the window gives to a backstreet. The window isolation is really poor, so wind entered from everywhere and noise was constant. On the backstreet, one vagabond stores empty bottles and is constantly changing them from one box to another, so bottle noise is constant and he did that for all three nights I stayed so I suspect he lives there. Also, there is a motor noise coming from somewhere, not loud but easily audible and disturbing. Curtain were so thin the light from the building in front illuminated all the room. Sheets were dirty and furniture very old and worn-out."
623,"Where to begin... room was dirty with paint peeling off the walls and bed headboard broken. Shower was crawling with bugs one morning. No tea or coffee making facilities to be found, and no fridge. Other people’s hair in the bed.  Heating comes on automatically twice a day, so if you’re cold during the night there’s nothing you can do, the bed sheets are also super thin. They charged us $8 to leave some bags for a few hours before our afternoon flight, despite paying nearly $200 to stay there.. AND they would not let us pay by card, so we had to walk to find an ATM which charged us $6 to withdraw the money to pay them. Absolutely terrible experience."
624,"Very good LOCATION, easy walking to most places you're likely to want to visit.  A quiet, peaceful, interesting & safe area.  ROOM: OK, very clean, bit small, cramped & not enough storage, hooks on the backs of doors would help. Bathroom was posing as a wet room but drainage not very good so floor remained wet despite the use of a mop/scraper (provided).  2 tiny beds tied together by the legs, we used them as 2 singles but they're very narrow & we felt in danger of rolling onto the floor!  Garden is more a yard full of overgrown ivy, garden pots, and a full rubbish bin which wasn't emptied for the 4 nights we were there.  Hopefully Charlotte will turn it back into a garden for the summer.    BREAKFAST was great - ideal for us, slight variations each day & plenty of it.  SERVICE:…"
625,"Well located, with helpful service. Towels are old and not well kept. Some lights were not working. There was some remodeling work going on at the wrong time. Started too early and even on a Saturday afternoon.  I would not return even though I liked the neighborhood. "
626,"The good - location, location, location! The Shelley is a 3 story/30 room hotel in the middle of the ""Art Deco"" district. It is on the main drag, Collins Avenue, between 8th and 9th Street, only one block from Ocean Drive, the heart of South Beach. You are close to all the action but without all the noise and crowds that you have on Ocean Drive. Espanola Way is just a short walk away and the best Cuban restaurant for value and food, Puerto Sagua, is only 1 block away. I would give 5 stars if location was my only criteria.     To be expected - a small ""European"" sized hotel room with no view, a small bathroom and a loud wall mounted air conditioning unit.  No amenities, that means no luggage rack to put your luggage on or dresser or built-in to put away your clothes; only 1…"
627,"The hotel is new and well located - close to Metro and tram. The room and facilities were very spacious with nice decor. However , people in the reception and room cleaning were not really nice in terms of helping and being polite. The cleaning of the room  was poorly done - the garbage and towels were not taken/changed. Parking was just beside the hotel, which was really handy.  "
628,"Average and not befitting a Marriott brand. Staff were brilliant, however. Stayed December for Porto v Leicester City Champions League game. Only stay if you are visiting the football stadium. There also appeared to be a lot of businessmen staying.  Positives: Quick and helpful check in, allowing choice of room. Excellent staff, particularly in the bar/restaurant.  Happy, caring people, great service. Great bar, bar food and restaurant with free WiFi. Steps away from stadium, ideal for a game. 3 minute walk. TVs in bar showing the match, good for those without tickets. Next to a large shopping centre for shops, bar and food court. Close to Metro Station, 5 minute walk.  Negatives: No in room safe. Minimalistic room, no real comfort, cold unwelcoming feel. Wallpaper peeling in…"
631,we lıke that hotel. beatifull rooms. good design.  little far from cıty center but not a bıg problem.....................................................................................................................
632,The hotel is very well located. There are many restaurants and shops around. The rooms are very clean and everything works perfectly.The bar and the rooftop are very nice and fashion. Beautiful decor in the lobby.Friendly staff.
633,"Just returned from 2 nights at the Steigenberger. Lovely hotel. Rooms very clean and comfortable. Pillows were great. Lots of space, plug points and good WiFi connection. Breakfast was very nice. Tea and coffee in room plentiful. It is, however, the staff who make this hotel a great place to stay. Very welcoming and helpful. Would definitely stay here again. "
634,"A 2* hotel. Modern, small rooms and very clean. Right next to the hotel is a huge supermarket. Very close to the main shopping street and the famous Majestic cafe. Right next to it is an excellent car park, which costs 7 euros per day with an arrangement from the hotel. Excellent breakfast in a modern dining room, which includes hard-boiled egg, fruit, coffee, fresh orange juice, delicious bread, cheese and sausage."
635,"We spent 5 nights at the Lindemanns as it was a special Birthday.  Hotel staff were knowledgeable of the area, friendly and helpful. Room was a little cosy but clean and the bed comfortable.  Great location. Walk roughly 20 minutes to potsdamer Platz  Lots to do and great places to eat locally and further into the city.  I ❤️Berlin and would highly recommend this hotel if you visit. Like i said ideal location.  Breakfast was reasonable in price and decent coffee. "
636,"overpriced. Insecticide smell. Overlooking construction site. Senior's centre.   1. overpriced - normal price is 4,000,000 dong??? Seriously? For this? That's like $175 USD???? In Vietnam? Really? Wow. You might get it for $105 USD but it's still too much. 2. Room is small - overlooking a construction site which blocks view of the sea? (be careful which room you book) 3. Pool and seaside are FAR from the rooms. It's a BIG resort so you could be walking a long way to get down to the pool. 4. No place for kids to play? Pool has no kiddie section 5. Grounds look nice but no place for kids to play on the grass or anywhere else that I saw.  6. Flies everywhere. Not their fault but this whole peninsula is FULL of flies. This is not a joke. While you're eating they're all over you.…"
638,the 2 bedroom apartment was very good with all facilities. we booked apartment with breakfast. the lady at the restaurant who speaks English was very very rude it seems she was doing a favour on us  we were very upset
639,"An imposing building in a good location for touring Berlin and in a quiet area where you'll avoid the noise of the city but it's a good walk to the major sights (e.g.Potsdammerplatz 15 mins, 20 mins to Checkpoint Charlie, 30 mins to Brandenburg Gate/ Alexanderplatz). That didn't bother us as we prefer to see a city by walking but it might be too far away for some although there is public transport within 10 mins walk. BEWARE of which room you reserve. We reserved a Junior King Suite expecting Club lounge access but didn't have it so we upgraded to a King Executive but were charged extra, note that if you want Club Lounge access book an EXECUTIVE room.  We would thoroughly recommend paying for this as it included an outstanding full buffet breakfast (normally 19euros each),…"
640,"Clean, close to all sightseeing areas, great breakfast place just across the street and friendly staff. The rooms are small but we were out all the time and came back only to crash...so we didn't mind. Try getting a room close to the courtyard and not up front, as it can get really loud."
641,"We were here for 5 nights in February and really enjoyed our stay.  Our room was modern and had the most comfortable bed! The hair dryer is good.  We had our breakfasts in the lobby coffee shop and had the best cappuccinos in our whole trip to Spain.  It is an easy 6 blocks to the hop on hop off bus.  Also the taxis to get around were easy and not expensive.  There are places to eat all around, plus the hotel had live music most nights.  We had a very comfortable and very quiet room, and the staff were very friendly. We really enjoyed our stay and recommend this hotel."
642,"I’ve had a wonderful experience with VinOasis , the facilities and the staff.... up until today. Today upon entering into the Buffet, one of the staff told me to “put on a shirt”, and she directed me to the board, which was fair enough. Mind you I was wearing a muscle tee, not a full singlet.. Upon being cooperative with the staff, I noticed several, if not many females walk out with FULL singlets. I asked the staff what the deal with that was , and she replied “that rule only applies to males”. A bit sexist don’t you think?  Having to walk half way across the huge property , just to put on a shirt because the rule apparently “only applies to males” , I was not very happy. I would not come here again, because there are different rules for different genders... apparently."
645,"Nice hotel, good location, nice and helpful staffGood breakfastEnjoyed very close to the train station, the area has many restaurants shops and cafesTwo parents and two kids, we got adjoining rooms separate unit was excellent "
647,"This hotel is certainly not for everyone.  If you want to spend over 400 per nigh to stay in a room that resembles a college dorm room where shower and sink is next to your sink, this ‘hotel’ is for you.  I thought this is a higher end Marriott so I picked this one up.  I won’t be repeating my stay here."
651,"My recommendation is to stay where you want to visit/eat or eat near where you stay. This hotel is not convenient to going to the central part of town. Taxi ride up or down is about 6 euros each way. The taxi's are not air conditioned and they will not take you directly to the hotel. You would think that a Heritage Hotel would have the rooms air conditioned before arrival but this one did not.  When temperatures are in the upper 90's, they should do that. The lobby is also not air conditioned and the Wifi is spotty at best. We were also driving a car to the hotel and could not find it by GPS or smart phone since the hotel is in a no drive zone (residents/employees only). It took us about 30 minutes to get to the hotel after arriving on the hilltop. They said they sent a map with…"
652,"No bad points really, everything works in ship-shape style. We are in Gemany, after all. Most of us use hotels basically for sleeping, so there is little need for fancy interiors, room service etc. This hotel delivers just that."
653,Rooms where spacious and big comfy bed. Hotel is approx 15 minute walk to the berlin walk and 30 mins to Brandenburg Gate. Tried the restaurant food and cocktails where lovely. Staff where helpful and friendly. The only downside there isn’t any kettle in the rooms which for a 4 star hotel would expect also the 3rd night they didn’t change bed sheets even though food stains where visible which was from myself but you would expect to put new ones on. They just made the bed with the dirty sheets. 
654,Upon opening the door to my room I was immediately impressed with how large the room was.   The bed was comfortable and the sheets soft and cozy. The large enclosed rain shower is amazing and I had to keep myself from spending hours in there.   Provided bath products were nice and the extras like q-tips were appreciated.   The location is close enough to a couple u-bahn stations and a grocery store down the road a few minutes.   A major shopping area (street) is just a couple minutes walk which is a great way to spend a few hours.   A worthwhile stay and I would stay again.
655,"Good location, only a few minutes from Avinguda diaganol. Facilities good but bars didn't seem to open during times quoted which was disappointing. Rooms good, beds comfy, everything we needed for our stay including a large mini fridge. Coffee was awful but nice selection of teas. "
656,"The toilet constantly ran, the bathtub didnt drain. The bed lacked proper sheets. There was a felt sheet that was COVERED in hair under all the sheets.  The staff was rude checking in.  The ""deposit"" for the hotel room was more than I paid for actually staying there. Witch was ridiculous. it was 75$ per night.  "
657,Hotel is situated very near to Eiffel Tour and it is within walking distance. Various restaurant are situated nearby with a good view of the Eiffel Tower during meals. Room is very clean and staff are very friendly.
658,"Good location, welcoming and helpful staff, comfortable , clean en suite bedroom. Decent breakfast options. Close to U station, walking distance for shops, bars and restaurants .Quality and value.  Will be back."
659,"Cannot ask for a better location, located at the very center of the city and all tourist spots can be accessed by foot. Just around 10 mins walk to the Ribeira river. Staff are very friendly and welcoming, was offered two glasses of port wine as welcoming drink. The room was nice, just feel a little cold when bathing as the bathtub is located in the room but not inside the bathroom, the room do get a little noisy as it's very close to some restaurants but it's tolerable after closing the door windows. The breakfast was nice as well."
660,"The location is very convenient being only just off La Rambla.  The only down side of this is that it was VERY noisy, particularly on Friday and Saturday night. Apartments at the rear are probably quieter.  Any problems we had were dealt with extremely well by Gonzalo who was lovely and helpful. He also booked vists and taxis for us as well as giving lots of advice and recommendations. Thank you Gonzalo."
661,"This is a unique hotel, at least for me as an American. That being said, we LOVED our stay here, but I want to offer some thoughts to help others prepare to stay here.  This is not a traditional hotel--ie. the staff is only there 9-6. If you come after hours, you have to navigate the check in process using a keypad on the street. Luckily, it went smoothly, but it was not what we were expecting.  The apartment was lovely, although, the decor is a bit austere for my tastes. The suite we stayed in was truly like an apartment--two separate bedrooms and bathrooms, a kitchen, table, and tiny living room. Super cozy for our family of four.   The reception area of the hotel is open 9-6 and has all sorts of goodies to make your stay easy--apples, cookies, dish soap, laundry soap.  The…"
662,The hotel is very good value for money. Super friendly staff. My room was very quiet. I enjoyed the continental breakfast. I’m recommending the hotel to anyone looking for a place that is central — very close to the Eiffel Tower.
663,"I'm a big fan of the W and try to stay at their properties whenever possible, so it's with a heavy heart to report that the W Chicago City Center is in need of a physical overhaul. The staff is amazing - super friendly and helpful - so no fault of their own. But physically, the hotel looks tired, smells kind of like stinky sneakers (especially the hotel rooms) and needs some new paint, softer sheets and, in general, some love from corporate.   Pros: staff (incredibly helpful and outgoing).   Cons: scratchy sheets, older towels, musky/locker room smell in the hotel rooms, noisy (you'll definitely hear your neighbor's telephone conversations, his/her hallway discussions, and all the sounds of downtown Chicago from your room - traffic, loading trucks, train, horns).  "
664,"a nice hotel with quirky  design elements on a central location in the city. A small hickup was the checkin late at night. Since my room was booked and paid in advance by someone else, I could not show the creditcard that had been used to pay. Therefor I had to pay again whilst the amount that was paid was reimbursed to the Original creditcard acount."
665,"At 9:45pm of our first night, our room was not fixed -- no water, no new towels, bathroom and bed not cleaned even if we have no sign not to disturb us. Then after cleaning. A female staff knocked at our door at 1030pm, she spoke no English and left! We emailed to GM and duty manager, no reply until now. Didnt expext this from a Shangrila. "
666,"Its location is convenient as it is just 5 mins from the metro station. The food court ( Mercado Bom Sucesso, open 10am to midnight) which is just adjacent to the hotel within the Music Hall complex gives both convenience and excitement to all hotel guests. No coffee making machine, nor water heater in the room. Nearby cafes would open at about 9 or 10am. For any early birds, you have to have the house breakfast buffet.  Although the room is small, its design is efficient, smart and chic. There is music broadcast throughout the corridor and lobby to enhance its theme. On top of that, there are live music performances in the food court in the evening till about mid-night. If you happen to stay during some festivals like we did in February, the rehearsals and performances would…"
667,"The Honeymoon Petra Villas is in an excellent position with beautiful views and handy for restaurants, shops and transport. The staff here are excellent and whilst being discreet they are always there if you need them (even before you realise it.) They are so friendly and will go the extra mile for you - they are 5 star. We believe that the hotel has been open for 10 years and although the furnishings are very comfortable they are showing signs of wear - cushions on the loungers and chairs are stained and need cleaning or replacing. There is a nasty green line around the pool. We had a studio in the Petra wing which was spotless and convenient for everything, pool, bar & restaurant, but lacked in other ways. It would have been useful to have a rail outside to dry swimwear on.…"
668,"My room had bloody sheets on the bed! Housekeeping didn't change the sheets from the last guest, or put bloody sheets on the bed, or over a bloody mattress pad that soaked up.  The front desk people refused accountability, no apologies, no reimbursement, nothing from guest services although I've contacted them three times and sent a photograph of the spot with their hotel pen in the photo. They put me at risk to contract hepatitis or even HIV aides. Here's what happened: On a recent business trip I stayed here for two nights. The room was expensive and seemed clean. First night I slept on left side of the bed. In such a ""green"" hotel, and many average hotels, linens are not changed every night but rather every 3 days.  on the second night as I was pulling back the covers to …"
669,"This hotel is in a great location, but thats about all it has going for it.  The rooms are dated, with fraying carpet, peeling paint, wall panels falling off, mold in the shower (or both rooms we stayed in).  The rooms were dirty, had hair and stains on the sheets.  It was more along the lines of a Best Western.  We were ignored by staff coming and going and got a ""sorry about that"" when we told the front desk about all the issues.    Eat at Wildberry's around the corner (use the NoWait app), The Gage on Michigan and do the riverboat tour."
670,"Bathroom and linen were dirty (see attached photos). There was also a terrible smell coming from the drains and the sink. Regarding the service, the hotel booked for me a remis (driver) to visit the vineyards and said the price would be 380 pesos. However, when we arrived in the vineyard and there was no way to come back, the remis changed the price to 600 pesos. On the second time, the hotel booked another remis for 500 pesos. And again the remis changed the price to 700 pesos when we arrived in the vineyard. When I returned to the hotel I complained that the agreed price was 500 pesos and the hotel simply stated that this was not its responsibility. The hotel offers a service of a company that cheats the clients and do nothing to solve it. How can we trust in service like…"
671,"Residence Inn cancelled our hotel room we booked for the weekend August 5-8 2017.  We booked our hotel through Expedia prepaid over $1000 for our 3 night stay.  On August 5th we left our home and drove to Chicago from Toronto.  It was a long drive about 12 hours with family as we made several stops along the way. When we arrived at about 10pm to check in the lady at the front desk had told us our room was cancelled bc there was ""flooding"".  And if I received an email from Expedia earlier in the afternoon.  Sure enough 5pm earlier that day I received that the hotel had cancelled my reservation Bc it was overbooked.   The lady at the front desk lied!   residence inn did nothing to help me at first.  The girl at the front desk simply turned away and ushered our family aside while I…"
672,The staff is really nice .The hotel is really clean and the rooms are ok.The location is really good.Breakfast is ok .Not many options if you stay several days...I think is the same every morning..Good value for the location
673,It was a nice stay at the Hotel La Demeure. The staff was very friendly and courteous (also for requests in the late evening). The hotel is centrally located and there are good restaurants nearby. I would book this hotel again.
674,"We spent a week at the Apartment Hotel Adina at Checkpoint Charlie.  The hotel is located a few blocks NE of checkpoint Charlie, close (10-15 minute walk) to several subway stations (Stadtmitte, Kochstrasse, Hausvogteiplatz) which made it convenient to get around by subway.   We had a premier king room.  The room itself is really large and comfortable, though not luxurious.  More like an actual 1BR apartment than a hotel room.  There is a bedroom with closet and TV, a balcony (not much to see), living room and kitchen with oven, microwave and dishwasher and a built in desk.  The bathroom is a bit small, but has a washer & dryer.  There could have been a few more outlets, but they were sufficient.    We had a minor problem with the TV and the maintenance people came up and fixed…"
675,"Just stayed for 2 nights on business and charged $1,160.  Hotel not even finished - no bar, no breakfast, lights not plugged into anything in room...  Total disconnect between facilities and value.  The Fairmont would've cost only 10% more!!  Appreciate SF is expensive but this felt like a fleecing for a very average experience!"
676,"We've stayed in Waldorf Astoria for two nights over Chinese New Year. It started well - swift check in, lovely rooms. All as expected for the price you pay. On the second night of our stay we realized that our son's favorite cuddly toy disappeared from the room. It is not just any toy, it went to bed with him every night for several years and was integral part of his life and the travel routine. The only way for it to 'escape' from the room is during the change of bedding. It's a large toy and easy to spot, so it is clear that it went through several pairs of hands before being thrown away. We had similar experiences in other hotels (e.g. Four Seasons HK) and our things were always returned to us with apologies. Not in Waldorf. Clearly inadequate attention was paid at all…"
677,"The rooms are very small, dark and dirty too much dust. There's no door to the bathroom, just a courtain which makes it very uncomfortable. Not recommended for families. The location isn't the best. Parking not always available."
678,"I try to avoid a one star for any property or restaurant.  But this property combines incompetence with indifference.  We did an advance booking meaning we prepaid.  Some of our family arrived first and were told we had to pay for the rooms.  When the manager was told it was prepaid, she refused to check and just demanded a credit card.  No amount of pleading would convince her to move her precious fingers to the keyboard to just check.  Once we came back with proof, no apology and couldn't be bothered to do a refund.  Nope, we had to wait until next week when someone ""who the number to call"" would be back.  Seriously.  She said EVERY manager but her knew the number.  The ironic thing was the next day (Saturday) the morning manager had the same, exact story!  Calling the Hilton…"
679,An old aloft hotel newly taken over by the doubletree.  It is being horribly managed and no one seems to know what they are doing.  No concierge on duty.  No one could even give us any info about art basel!
680,"Very nice looking property. Although the staff has a very professional appearance, they seem very indifferent to providing any kind of support. The front desk listens to any complaint, but they do not follow through."
681,"We stayed in this hotel as a family. Very nice indeed. Huge spacious room and good breakfast. The hotel is 10-15 minutes walk to Festival Centre. Very conveniently located for the train station (8 minutes walk). There are plenty places around the hotel for grocery shopping, cafe, deserts. The room has tea/coffee facilities. We were quite happy with our stay."
682,"The staff at Hotel Gabriel were very friendly (exspecially Florence & Chloe) and went above and beyond our exceptions.  It was our 40th anniversary and when we arrived at the hotel we got 2 upgrades and there was red rose petals and a red rose petal heart on our bed plus some gifts.   The breakfast was very good!!!  Lots of choices croissants, assorted breads, eggs, meats and cheese.  There was juice, coffee and tea and fresh fruit.  The hotel is located near bus, metro and in a very walkable area of Paris. The bakery down the street is amazing and there is also a grocery store near by.   I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Paris!!!"
683,"I stayed at the hotel a couple times for work. The hotel is a bit dated but staff generally polite and rooms ok clean. Just based on that, I would probably give a three rating. But I am not sure the hotel staff is properly trained for a five star hotel.   During my first stay, I was trying to inquire how to walk over to a nearby building (10 mins by walk). I asked the bellboy who didn’t know the way, who then asked one of the “hosts” standing around the hotel, who also didn’t know the way, then asked the front desk...  Then there is the service at the breakfast restaurant, which is chaotic at best. There are often many “empty” but uncleaned tables  because the staff is unsure whether the guest has left, so I am often shown to tables very far away. Then one morning when I got to…"
684,"We were really looking forward to our stay at Hotel de Hallen & had heard/read great things about it, but were sadly disappointed by our experience. Although the decor is unique & stylish & our rooms were spacious & clean, we found that the layout of the hotel doesn’t really work very well – the guest rooms are all located off of a central corridor area, which has seating running along the length of it. This layout, & the close proximity of the rooms to these communal areas, means that noise travels quite substantially throughout the hotel & that the rooms themselves are quite noisy (which was particularly evident one night during a wedding celebration that was being held in the hotel bar/restaurant). I was surprised that the rooms didn’t have better sound-proofing given the…"
686,"I stayed here for one night on a Saturday. The moment I entered my room on the fourth floor, the noise from the traffic struck me as extraordinarily loud. I thought the windows could be open but they were not. The next morning at 5am I was woken up by the bells from the cathedral opposite. This was followed by very loud Choir singing for two hours straight. There is no way you can sleep through that.  Apart from its relatively good location, there are no real plus points to stay here especially since there are a plethora of hotels to choose from in the vicinity.  The hotel breakfast spread was not bad though."
687,"Was looking forward to a fancy night in the city.  Checked in early and was told of a beautiful room with a view and to come back at check-in for the key (3pm at this location). When we returned after check in time we were told the room was not available yet (no defined time of when it would be ready either)...we agreed to an interior room- this interior room faced what I can only describe as building equipment (akin to an alley)...on top of this we began to hear a baby crying through the wall.  Fortunately, our room was switched only to realize that a 7th floor room actually has only half windows...so much for the view.  For all of the beauty and historical atmosphere this was the most disappointing money ever spent.  We did reach out to customer service which is done by text…"
688,"This lovely hotel, with its friendly and efficient staff, is very conveniently located. Not only are there lots of restaurants nearby, it's also within walking distance of the Gare du Nord and just a few minutes on foot to the Poissonnière metro station. Perfect for visiting Paris."
689,"I booked a room at this hotel for $429 a night, an already overpriced rate.  When I got the hotel confirmation email, the room was $479.  I immediately called both the Hotel and Hilton corporate and was given a corporate response that rates are always changing and that they must have changed while I was putting in my contact and credit card information.  I decided to cancel and stay at a hotel that actually engages in more ethical business practices."
690,"I would have loved to rate this hotel higher as I expected a great experience. Overall the service and friendly welcome was truly sincere and there are some staff in the concierge and breakfast restaurant who truly made our stay here special. However, things did nto start well. We were shown to our room which was up flights of stairs, then down a corridor and down another flight of stairs. Once there our baggage did not arrive. We wanted to change our clothes from our long flight and go out for a walk. I called twice to ask for the baggage and even went back to reception to ask for it (!) and finally it arrived after about 45 minutes! They apologised with a bottle of wine. Our second worse experience was that we had stayed for an initial 5 nights and then went to a relative's…"
691,This is a small Boutique hotel in a great location in the centre of Paris.  The reception staff during the day and the evening were first class - very helpful and always with a smile and positive approach.  There is limited parking belonging to the Hotel (4/5 spaces as far as I could tell) which we had booked which is situated on the other side of the road in a secure car park.  This is okay for a small car which is the theme of most of the car parks in Paris !  You could access this during the day if needed by borrowing the garage fob from reception.  The rooms we had were very clean and quiet and they had very effective air conditioning plumbed in which was very important to us !  You have the continental breakfast in the room which was excellent and to be recommended.  As an…
692,"Good place to stay in Riga, very central, Hotel was very quiet, rooms very clean, good gym facilities.  BUT....did not appreciate dishes being cleaned in washroom sink, this is not sanitary. Otherwise good location.  At one point in my week stay the key/card key to my room stopped working, went downstairs to reception to have it replaced. Receptionist at desk when asked my name smirked at my response, not professional.  The breakfast was always good, more than enough selection, BUT some staff not helpful at all. When asked for a coffee by the person making omelettes because she was the only one behind the counter and plus she was not making any omelettes nor was she serving ANY other costumers and was doing nothing at her station and there was none at my table and 2 coffee…"
693,"Stayed at this hotel for a couple of nights for a business meeting. This is a good place, about 30 mins drive from the airport. The hotel was very comfortable with excellent room service and facilities in the room. The views from the room were also very good. The staff was helpful as well."
694,"We stayed here on a visit to Portugal to see Eurovision. The hotel itself is situated right next door to the Arena which makes it extremely convenient if you are attending a show. It’s also well situated right next door to a shopping centre and lots of restaurants. Whilst it is not ideal if you are wanting to see Lisbon sights, for a show it is perfect.  That said, our stay was a little strange, probably as a result of the many Eurovision contestants and producers also staying at the hotel.   One such incident was asking for a corkscrew and an empty wine glass so we could drink some wine we had bought. There was no corkscrew or wine glass in the room (this is generally available in most 4-5 Star hotels). That’s no problem though, as we called reception to ask for one to be sent…"
695,"Stayed in a comfortable room with great views  This hotel is away from major tourist sites but is near a subway  & tram stop, making such sites easily accessible. The beach is a 5 minute walk and there is an adjacent mall / shopping area (plus nearby cafes). It is quieter than the bustle of Las  Ramblas!"
696,"The hotel was fine for a 3* and the price reasonable for San Francisco. Unfortunately there were lots of homeless people outside the hotel on all routes, an alley to the rear is clearly a popular sleeping place. My partner and I didn’t feel safe as we were offered drugs on multiple occasions. We made sure we got Uber’s to the front door of the hotel and didn’t walk in the local area, it’s a shame as 2-3 blocks away the civic centre is lovely. Valet Parking is $50 a night and it is difficult to find the drop off location on the side street opposite KFC. If I were going to San Francisco again I would pay slightly more and stay elsewhere. I would not stay here with children or indeed my mother. Sorry Hotel EPIK this is not a reflection of your hotel or staff rather the location."
697," Hotel is centrally located, so everything you want to visit is in walking distance and right by the old town. Rooms are stylish modern, but for my taste in too dark color. We got the junior suit and we found no big difference to a normal room our kids got. Room sizes are small and have bit of a strange floor plan. Breakfast buffet is great, but service too slow and it took them ages to bring the coffees. Also cold chocolate milk seems to be a strange order, as it took them more than 15min to prepare it. In general the friendliness of the staff is moderate, especially the main waiter at breakfast. An important thing the hotel needs to rethink are the body cleaning products. Not really 5 star level. The same applies to the tv channels and the everyday repeating music in the…"
698,"We stayed 7 nights and really enjoyed this hotel, great location (the very best location in our opinion), great staff, comfortable beds and we had a large room out front with large open windows.  Buffet breakfast was limited, but varied each day and all was very good.  We would not hesitate to stay here again.  Bring some light weight hangers as there are no movable ones or do without.  Also if you need to hand wash clothes bring a  ""long"" string and clothespins as you will need to be creating finding what to tie/hook onto.  We would stay here again."
699,Did not get a double bed even though we had requested a bed for a couple. Not good for tourists as for some tours this hotel is not a pick-up point. The cost of breakfast was high given the spread. Overall we were disappointed              
701,"Conveniently located, walking distance to Brandenburg Gate & Holocaust Memorial, not to mention the shopping district nearby. Staffs are so courteous & helpful. (Shout out to Concierge Lutz, who helped us arrange for our day tour & Van Service to Potsdam) I could stay here and just roam around the city."
702,Rooms simple yet clean. Peaceful location. La rambla street is a 10 min walk..so is the famous Maremagnum mall. The reception staff answered all our queries patiently. Breakfast spread was decent and was included in the deal!!
703,"I'm pretty sure some of these reviews on here are fake,  there's no way some people could consider this place to be a good experience under vacation circumstances.    While the price is fairly cheap there are some things that just should not be overlooked when running a hotel on one of the busiest vacation spots on earth.   Things like, Running water - every time we took a shower the water would shut off for a brief period of time. I told the staff about it and they quickly jumped on it, but it never got fixed. At that point we just dealt with it because we only had one more day there and we didn't want the hassle of changing rooms.   Working elevators - apparently their whole elevator system is on the fritz. They had one elevator shut down for maintenance while the other two…"
704,"Good place for staying with friends, no parking place, so we had many problems for find a parking! That was the bad part of this place. Friendly place to stay, clean kitchen. But they didn't clean aout room during for days! Finally i like there.               "
705,My wife and I spent our last two nights in Barcelona here. The hotel itself is very pretty and clean. Our room was on the smaller side but was clean. We had a little snack at the roof top bar and the sangria was excellent.   Cons - bald headed guy on night crew has a lot of attitude. Not sure why there is tea available to be made in the rooms and not coffee. My biggest pet peeve these days -no usb outlets to charge phones with. 
706,"I had tried booking a room at this property for two nights through the website. Gave my credit card information and everything. Never received a confirmation email or anything. Thankfully I thought to call prior to my arrival, only to find out the direct phone # for the property is not a working number! I can't get a hold of the property directly, so after calling several different Days Inn and Wyndham customer service numbers, I was finally able to confirm that my reservation did NOT get put into the system. Very sketchy reservation system and I still feel uneasy that I submitted credit card information only to not have a reservation be created."
707,"Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in August. Did not like the area where the hotel was situated. 30 mins walk downhill to reach the riverside and even longer coming back and you have to walk up a very steep hill. Taxis and Metro are available to shorten part of the distance but even then not the best areas for walking in. Found the front desk staff not very friendly and they rarely looked up to greet you when you entered the hotel. (At one point there were 4 behind the desk!). They also had no idea as to what Melia Rewards entailed! The room was basic, clean and comfortable although the view from our first floor  window was over a back street where everyone could look into your bedroom. On the second evening the toilet cistern got stuck but as it was after 8pm there was no one…"
708,"The residence is located in an area that is friendly and safe. The interior is simple and nice. The fair price means fair service, fair room and fair bathroom. Wi-Fi is less than fair. The best point, after sleeping, you will have more money to enjoy the town."
710,"Intercontinental is the premier hotel within the group that includes Crown Plaza and Holiday Inn. This property is best to be a Crown Plaza. Converted from a bank building six years earlier, the engineers and designers forgot about guest comfort and amenities.   Our suite was very nice however the AC did not work properly our entire stay even with them knowing about the issues. No doubt this has been consistent since their opening. There was no balcony and if you opened a window the AC shut off. Turn down amenity is a Holiday Inn type chocolate square and one bottle of water.   They advertise a wellness center with spa services but the entire experience is below average. Located in the basement, the wellness center consists of a terrible gym (very few free weights and no weight…"
711,"After being told that this was quite a good hotel and seeing the nice lobby, we had high hopes. Unfortunately, as soon as we got off the first floor things went downhill. The room was in fairly bad condition. The TV was high up and no remote was provided, the luggage that we had stored at the front desk disappeared for a while, the bathroom door did not close and the carpet was filthy. Also, the view out the window was genuinely unpleasant. The street that the hotel is on can also get incredibly congested, although it is close to several attractions. There were some pluses, however - the reception staff spoke English very well, and the breakfast was good, especially the media lunas (similar to croissants.) I would recommend this hotel for people who speak no Spanish at all or…"
712,"My bf and I were very very happy staying at Nordic Hotel Berlin-Mitte! The room was very clean and pretty! I could have done without the translucent bathroom door but I managed to get over it :) The staff was super professional and incredibly kind and helpful. The location was great- about a block away from a great supermarket, 3 min walk to a tram and metro/subway, 10-15 min walk to bars, restaurants and central train station and the hotel is opposite a natural history/science museum. Also, close proximity (by tram) to the DDR Museum, a huge must!  I would definitely stay there again :)))"
713,We emailed the hotel some time before travelling and asked for a quiet room on a high floor. What we got was a noisy room on the ground floor. We were told by a receptionist that the higher floors were more expensive 'superior rooms' and even though we offered to pay for an upgrade we were told this was not possible.The breakfast was just average but the only coffee available was dispensed through a machine and I have never tasted anything so vile. I was told that these machines are standardised in all Pestana Hotels so I'll never use another. Charging 2 euros for an umbrella even for an hour seemed a bit cheap on the part of the hotel.
714,I spent one night in this hotel during a business trip to Sweden.The hotel is located not in the best Stockolm area but inside looks really much more better than first external impression. Good care in common area (very nice the minicarling table in the hall...). My experience was unfortuntaely not good: 1) small room  2) energy power far from bed 3) shower doors not working; I was not able to close them  I onestly think that my experience was not the standard but that's it and I comment it....
717,"Phenomenal view ! We came in a group of 2 couples ... Our agency didn't inform us that we had the standard room ... Bad surprise from the beginning !! Awful decoration and quality, don't even think it deserves 3 stars, even less 4! So if you come, book the superior room or don't even bother coming here -chose directly another hotel ! Mediocre service from the reception to the restaurant... No one to carry our bags on arrival and there were death flies in the cereals for breakfast!!! The food in general does not have a good quality, the fruits are not fresh but canned and even the Nutella is ""fake"". If you want to eat something in between meals they make you go to a bakery on the other side of the street because the ""kitchen is closed""... Forget room service 24/24 ! It's a really…"
718,"Location was excellent-a 10 minute stroll along the river to the Berlin Dom with a U-bahn station just across the road, one stop from Alexanderplatz with very regular trains. Very good breakfast.  New beds and extremely clean (only opened April.) Wouldn't hesitate to recommend"
719,"The hotel is very beautiful and the staff could not be nicer.  The history of the buildings is very interesting. I was disappointed in the size of my king canal view room. It was quite small. That said, the room was very well appointed with nice furnishings.  Room service was painfully slow even for things that require no cooking (salads, etc.). Average wait is 45 minutes. As noted, everyone was extremely nice, but the food just took too long to get.  I made some special requests for my room and none of them was honored prior to my arrival.  Overall, was expecting more from a Waldorf.  "
720,"L'Hôtel Gabriel is without a doubt my favorite hotel in the world!  We had the pleasure of staying at L'Hôtel Gabriel the first week in June.   The hotel is gorgeous, and so charming!  We were greeted with a warm, friendly smile, and made to feel welcome every moment we were there.  The staff is exceptional!  So helpful, attentive, and always willing to offer suggestions for restaurants and places to visit! The rooms are beautiful and the beds are very comfortable.  The breakfast is lovely and a great way to start every morning.    Lots of things, big and small, add up to the best imaginable hotel stay.  An exceptional stay from start to finish!  We will definitely be back!!  We arrived as boyfriend and girlfriend, and left as fiancés.  Perhaps we will return for our honeymoon!"
721,"I checked in tonight for a conference, placed in a 6th floor Versailles room that overlooks the HVAC system (white noise all night your thing?). Windows don’t open so I could be staying anywhere - no ocean breeze here. Radio was an old iHome version with an iPod plug, with no power jack to boot so forget about bringing your vintage iPod to plug in. Old TV in the bathroom that doesn’t work - no bathtub, just a smallish shower stall. And TV is old,  no high definition to speak of.  Ready to leave this place. Which I’ll want to do especially in the morning when I’m lacking caffeine because there is no coffee or tea in the room. Tried calling guest services with no help. Gave up on them. "
722,"My apologies, this review is a bit late in being submitted.  I chose the Mercure Hotel Checkpoint Charlie on my very first visit to Berlin in May 2018.  I chose the hotel for its location, since I was fairly sure I could locate on foot without having to use a taxi.  I was correct.  The hotel is located between two subway stations - Kochstrasse and Stadtmitte.  At the Berlin Hbf (main train station), I was told to get off at Kochstrasse to reach the hotel.  However, I found Stadtmitte to be much closer.  Also, you avoid the tourist crowds at the Kochstrasse station, which is very near the Checkpoint Charlie exhibit.  So, the hotel, well, it provides all you need for a few nights stay.  The hotel only has one elevator and can be a bit cramped at times.  But seemed to be always…"
723,"I really enjoyed the hotel and for sure I will go back but next time with my husband. Room good, cleanliness excellent, breakfast good and varied. Only the lady from the reception who checked me in needs to improve a lot. When I get the reception I do not see anyone but I hear background noise should be watching some movie on the computer and (was not able to get up and say good afternoon come to this side to do your check in please) Unfriendly, never gave a smile ... but this must happen everywhere. However I returned home super happy with the hotel and the city. Regards Brakensiek"
724,"Nice surrounding atmosphere and friendly staffs. Accomodation was very comfortable and nice, as well. The hotel is on an accessible location nearby Köpenick centre to go out in the evenings having dinner or to have a nice beer."
725,"The junior suites were old, dark, dirty looking rooms that haven't been updated in quite a while...changed my room twice, to no avail...the best room had sections of patched carpet and the facet in the tub never stop running and the toilet won't flush correctly..."
726,"Staff had no personality at all. Room was average at best. No coffee in the room. Shower did not work. Front desk told me to go to the local YMCA. first maintenance man couldn’t get the shower to work, asked how much time I had. No one even tried to fix the issue before when I had to leave. Second maintenance man came after I said I needed to leave - and a MIRACLE occurred - the shower worked. Unfortunately I had already washed up in the sink. Front desk could not have cared less. Didn’t even ask how my stay was. Do not stay here. "
727,"This hotel was great, brilliant location and great service whilst we were there. However, I need to rate this as terrible because on my return home to the UK I have found that they have charged an extra $175 to my credit card. I have contacted them on numerous occasions and not yet had the courtesy of a response. My advice would be to pay cash and do not give over your credit card details."
728,"another hotel that I stayed in at the Sloterdijk part of Amsterdam. More or less what would expect from this kind of hotel. Room was okay and big enough and very quiet. Breakfast was a good selection and everything was ok, Wifi etc. Also, there is a free document printing service available upon request.   Location is awful it has to be said. Although there is a decent bar/restaurant opposite. Main problem with the location is it does not feel safe. People mill around the SPAR supermarket that is adjoined to it. In saying that, the supermarket does come in really handy.  This is not a budget hotel and does not accept cash to pay for reservations, it is card only. It is about 5 minutes walk from Sloterdijk train station."
729,"We have just returned from a three-night stay in this quirky (in a nice way), centrally-located hotel. Recommend by Lonely Planet as a mid-range priced accommodation, the hotel is situated in a quiet street within easy walking distance (20 minutes) of some of the city's most-visited attractions. The building is a communist-era tenement block, but the lower three floors have been nicely converted to offer good quality accommodation and facilities at a reasonable rate. The ground floor has the reception area which is nice to relax in (free coffee and tea facilities) and a lift leading to the upper two floors. Our bedrooms were large and of a high standard of decoration which included some (fake) Old Masters paintings. We had the Mona Lisa hanging over our comfortable bed! …"
730,"We stayed at this hotel for the first time. It was so cool, because we enjoyed the rest. People at the reception always were in a good mood. Of course! Food! I wanna eat all time, because it was fantastic! Thanks to the hotel for our wonderful holiday! "
731,"What an adorable hotel! Located in a quiet neighborhood of Montparnasse, super close to the Metro which made getting around so easy. The staff was helpful and gave us marvelous recommendations. Would definitely come back! "
732,"This is a little further from the beaches and town than we had hoped.  It is about a 10 minute walk into town and a 30 minute walk to the nearest beach with the furthest beach being 40-50 minute walk.  We didn't mind walking so it was okay for us and they do offer one shuttle per day, but if walking that much is difficult for you this wouldn't be a good location.  We were a couple traveling together and requested a bed big enough for both of us. Instead we got two twin beds pushed together.  I have seen this in a lot of European hotel rooms and while its not ideal, it is fine.  Here, however, the beds moved a lot so it was impossible to keep them together if we wanted to cuddle.  Additionally, the room had a view of the bus station which was bright and loud at some points.  Some…"
734,"I stayed on the 9th floor of this hotel for six nights during a recent business trip.   The first two nights were in a room with a constant yet arrhythmic beeping coming from god-knows-where that I eventually deduced was caused by some nearby electronic signal's being interrupted by the incessant din of 24-hour power-tool construction across the street. When I tried to change rooms, reception told me a) I couldn't change to a single-bed room since my company had booked a twin room and b) I wouldn't be able to do so till after 2 PM.   All my colleagues had in fact changed their rooms to single-bed ones the day before, so a) was clearly a lie. I asked the condescending receptionist that others in our delegation had been able to change rooms, so why couldn't I? Only then did she…"
735,i was most impressed by the top quality and service of this hotel.  The rooms are beautifully equipped with great taste.  The staff were most helpful and friendly and it was a real pleasure to find such a lovely hotel and at such reasonable price right in the centre of Cannes.  
736,"Spent a few nights here in October and I couldn't have been happier. I was looking for a non-traditional hotel. Something not so cookie cutter. Yes... you never know what to expect, but Im glass we did because this is a little gem of a hotel.   The staff is very friendly, had a few conversations with the night staff. They were all very helpful.  Hotel doesn't really do meals, but Paris has so much to offer, get out of the hotel and explore!!   This was a very short walk to Eiffel Tower, a bunch of cafes and such. The Big bus tour stop was also close (by the tower) that took us all over Paris.The metro is a short walk as well. The metro was so easy to use in Paris, so well organized - very easy to take you all over the city and to other placed that your bus tour doesn't get to. …"
737,It was a very good hotel  The personal was very kind and spoke a little bit german and perfect english The room was clean and the bathroom was amazingly big with a rain shower The location was perfect 5 minutes to the beach and 5 minutes to the subway station Breakfast was good The only downside was that u have to wait up to 10 minutes for a table at the breakfast
738,"Good location - you can walk to most major sites. Comfortable, clean and tidy, good sized rooms with everything provided that you need for a self contained stay.  Supermarket around the corner for all your needs. Would definitely recommend staying here."
739,"Its is situated very close to the city centre , about a 15 -20 minute walk and you are in the heart of Berlin or if you are feeling lazy there is the tram right outside the door .  The room was in perfect condition , not one bit of dirt was to be found and i am fussy , the windows are a little dangerous if you have small kids they open up half way and swing back ,so if you have small kids keep them shut ,the opening was up to my stomach . The room was average size . There was a safe , mini bar ( expensive like you would expect ) ,hangers , tv etc. We didnt have breakfast as we weren't up in time (it finished at 10 am )  The staff were great they spoke great English very pleasant on reception  Would go back !"
742,"If you don’t look above the age of 30 and aren’t travelling with parents, find another hotel because you’ll be made to feel unwelcome!! What should have been a great experience was disappointing because of the way staff treat you!!"
743,"We needed a place to stay in DaNang at short notice and the Danang Riverside Hotel seemed OK.  We booked a 2 bedroom apartment, However, the place is old and showing it.  The bedding is old, and our little boy got 5 bites from one of the beds.  There was no cooking pots or pans, no plates, knives, forks, chopsticks, no glasses, only a kettle and coffee cups.  It had an oven and washing machine, but these were blocked by a sofa in what was supposed to be the living room.  This room was useless, no TV, no coffee table, nothing but the kitchen blocked by an old sofa.  One of the baths was loose on the floor.  The breakfast was poor.  Not tasty and small selection.  The hotel is basically a tour group hotel, and a low class one at that.  I am really sorry that this is the case,…"
744,"Nice clean hotel, but miles away from Town Centre, at the end of the street you can catch the number 2 tram but the trams are always very busy, it takes about 15 mins tram ride into the center. The bedrooms are a good size and very clean but the tv kept freezing every 5 mins which was a pain we went with friends and their tv was doing the same so looks like its every room, just a shame that the location was bad."
746,I arrived in our room at 10.30pm exhausted from a 12 hour flight. I was in the suite. And on first site the rooms looked really beautiful and comfortable. I noticed a bad smell but I was so tired that I collapsed into bed and fell asleep. I woke up to the most disgusting smell in the bedroom and in the hallway. I complained and after speaking to 2 people finally someone arrived. I went to have a swim and came back to find 3 people in the bathroom with the drains all open and big buckets trying to wash down what was stuck in the drain and spread over the floor was masses of gunk that they had pulled out. No one appologised. No one offered me a new room. And by the evening the putrid smell had come back again. By 8.30 in the evening they put me in another suite 2 floors below…
747,This was the last leg of our journey through Greece.  Our arrival coincided with several other guests which made for a bit of a hectic arrival.  Our room was not done so we had a lovely and delicious lunch at the pool and were told our room would be available within a 1/2 ...the staff seemed to stretch our lunch as we waited almost 2 hrs for our room and then another 45 minutes to get our bags.  Rooms are extremely spare...no place comfortable to sit. Our bathroom was down about 3 steps - with only 1/2 the light over sink working and the doors under the basin broken and hanging off.  We asked 2 times to get the light bulb changed..never happened in our 3 days.. There were only 2 pillows on bed and we asked for ONE more - had to ask twice for that as well.  Evening turn down is…
748,"I quite liked this hotel, but cannot rate it higher than average because it pales in comparison to upscale hotels. The room was rather small and the shower stall was tight, which is not untypical of hotels in Europe, but it made for a tight and narrow room experience. (I'm quite thin and still found the shower stall to be on the small side). However, tt was comfortable and the location is very convenient to the metro, Praça Rossio (Rossio Plaza), and Praça da Figueira (Figueira Plaza), which is the start point for many hop-on, hop-off tour buses. The staff were excellent, very friendly, and could not have been more helpful. I did not eat there, but I did avail of the adult beverage that was provided for free upon check-in. The upstairs bar was pretty cool and the bartender…"
749,"For our 4 day stay this was a fortunate choice with thoughtfully well appointed and designed fittings and facilities, friendly helpful staff, great value and tasty breakfasts and a feeling of calm to retreat to at the end of days of walking and sight seeing. We Australians did find the ambient temperature a little high and because our room faced Wallstrasse when we opened the window to let some cool air in, the noise from the street was of industrial decibels, particularly on the Saturday night when the hard partying Berliners gathered at the bus stop for the ride home. So it was a choice between a comfortable room temperature and a quiet night. Also, the chairs in what we assume is the breakfast room are a little low for a good match with the tables. Despite these minor issues,…"
751,"After a full day of touristing, we arrived at the hotel just willing to get to the room and take a shower. The bad experience started at the parking with the guard pushing us to move fast because a bus had arrived with guests? Was us guests too, I was slow because I have a 4 years daughter wich I care. Them at the reception the atender rasied all issues to make it harder to get the room, it was necessary toa sk for a senior person to help. In the room, as soon as we started unpacking my wife noticed some pieces of paper in the floor, after a closer look it was paper , hair clipers and lot of dust, we called the staff which came fast and cleaned, but the bad impression was made already. At the bathroom the body lotion was half used.  WIFI is only free for 1 hour, carefull if you…"
752,"Ive visited the skybar on several occasions and was looking forward to stay at the hotel for the first time. The check in sorted out well and we where ready for a great weekend in riga. There is one thing that is keeping me from staying at this hotel again and that is becuase of the rude staff that are working in the bar. The reason is: We where sitting outside and enjoying a couple of cold brewskies. Some guys (who we didnt knew) who where also drinking decided to join us, After some hours we decided to leave for the hotelroom. Vi had a bill on a aprox 40 euros. Unfortunatly the idiots that was sitting next to us decided to leave without making any payments. The bar tried to put the blame on us telling ""We thought they were your friends, you should have asked for a seperate…"
753,"Lovely modern and clean hotel, stayed for 1night with 2 children  Would return in future  Centrally located and parking nearby  Continental buffet breakfast (optional extra) was lovely, room was fine and comfortable and all modern  Staff friendly and helpful  "
754,"We had booked moxy during our business trip to Berlin.It was well located close to the metro station. Reception was funcky and weird(in a good way), rooms were provided to us after 3pm.Rooms were pretty spacious neat and clean.Comfortable beds. Lighting was sufficient.Lifts were interesting as well, you could write anything on the glass of the lift. They could have provided more hangers to hang clothes.The ironing room was awesome.toilets were small but sufficient & clean. Overall a good experience,definately worth the visit."
755,all the amenities are old and dated the q's for drinks are long and the stairs are many  the food has been thrown together and if you get the sitting wrong there will be q's there there is no beach but the gardens are ok .......
756,"Stayed here two nights as part of a two-week tour of Europe. Paris, of course, is one of the most difficult cities in which to find a decently-priced hotel, but the France Albion was wonderful. Staff answered all of my questions prior to arrival regarding finding the hotel - and it was a very short walk from a Metro station - and the staff we dealt with there handled everything wonderfully, including arranging our shuttle to DeGaulle for Sunday morning. The room was a little small - but not by Paris standards - and I would have not problem staying at the France Albion again."
757,"I was attending the TFWA World Conference and needed a hotel that was less expensive.  This hotel was wonderful!  The front desk staff was always helpful.  although I couldn't speak French.  Upon my return every night they made sure I could have my glass of wine to relax in my sweet and charming room.  The windows in my room absolutely were my favorite- I overlooked the rooftops of the neighboring homes and could see the sunset every night.  The room was very clean everyday, the bed very comfortable.  Although small, the room was perfect for me and would have been fine for a couple, very romantic.  Breakfast was wonderful; fresh bread, meats, cheeses, fruits, juice and latte from a machine that made a killer brew.  I will return if I ever return to Cannes.  The walk to and from…"
758,"My wife and I arrived at Bom Sucesso resort full of excitement and looking forward to a short break, I am glad is was short, (we seldom do self catering, after all it is a holiday! ) That sounds rather harsh , however, on our arrival the young lady at reception was superb, we got to our one bed end of terrace house, superb, well presented, fully equipped and nicely decorated, so far so good, we decided to go to the clubhouse for dinner...........  it was empty, ok, I can deal with that, clubhouses are not always thriving , although it was early evening, service again superb, food was excellent. We got up to play golf and decided to have breakfast at the clubhouse, it was superb, as was the service, however it was empty bar one other couple, we had breakfast on three occasions,…"
761,"Beautiful building in Charlottenburg near the ZOO. Wealthy residential and hip areas are within walking distance. Good public transit connections. It’s a BonVoy Autograph collection hotel so their aspirations are boutique, not quite sure they get there. Glam (mirrors, sparkles, crystal) décor in rooms. Black and white marble bathroom, large and comfortable. Very high ceiling and good AC. Service had some hick-ups though. We noticed on day 1 a problem with our shower and notified the reception to fix while we were out. On day 2 the problem caused flooding of the entire bathroom floor. Had to go to the reception again, was told it had been fixed. The receptionist very kindly walked with me back to the room to see that it hadn’t. The repair was completed that day, which I gather…"
762,"Stayed here for a business meeting because it was a few blocks from my meeting. Regret staying here because for over $300 a night I got an interior facing closet of a room with no view and barely any amenities. This is an older hotel with an eclectic style which you will definitely pay for. When finding my room which was on the inside row, I had a feeling it was going to be small because the hotel door was inward facing and sandwiched between two other doors unlike the externally facing doors. I felt like I was entering a janitors closet. The only room I've stayed in smaller than this was during my Europe trip.to Paris when I was in high school. Not good for business, family or amt travel whatsoever."
763,"This hotel is incredibly stylish, even down to breakfast and how it is served. In the room I would say that style comes at the expense of comfort - I prefer carpet to concrete - but the room was stunning nonetheless. The staff on the front desk were friendly and perhaps the most helpful I have come across in Europe. The gadgetry in the room will keep tech fiends happy! A great stay in a great hotel!"
764,Horrible customer service experience from hotel staff member Andre Allen. He was very unprofessional and should not be working in the service industry. Everything about my stay was good except for interactions with this particular employee.
765,The Sofitel hotel in Lisbon is beautiful but the bed was so uncomfortable it spoiled the entire stay! Room 410 is lovely however the king bed mattress was very uncomfortable.....it should be replaced with a new one as this one is so worn that the two sides slope down with a hump in the middle!
767,"Stayed here for 5 nights as a group of 12 lads on holiday in July, brilliant stay for meeting other people and getting involved in Berlin nightlife and culture.   For the price the hostel is an absolute bargain for us, we can't argue with it, provides everything we need to rest and recover after a mad night out in the brilliance of a Berlin nightlife (4 hours sleep before going out exploring)   Great space for storing clothes and showering/washing/sleeping, everything needed when not out exploring the culture or the nightlife of Berlin!  Only a 2 minute walk if that to Alexanderplatz which is a brilliant place and has a metro line, U-Bahn and S-Bahn so can literally reach any part of the city from here, location is 10/10. Would thoroughly recommend the 37.50 week pass for the…"
768,"I stayed in this beautiful hotel in St. Germain in early March for four nights.  I found the hotel to be charming, clean, quiet, and luxurious.  The hotel is centrally located in San Germain and in walking distance to many of the Parisan sites.  The staff - most especially Patrick and Emira  - were amazing.  I thoroughly enjoyed the evening ""turndown treat,"" open self-serve champagne bar, and availability of espresso and Perrier 24/7.   Umbrellas are available.   The bed was super comfy.  The toiletries are decadent - I'd buy that body wash and shampoo :) Breakfast was delicious - quality breads and croissants with great juices and coffees.  They even allowed me to eat early before my early flight back to Philly.  The rooms are small - but it's Paris.  My only complaint would be…"
769,"The hotel is located next to the Rossio Train Station and Restauradores metro station. We arrived from Sintra by train and only had a small walk from the train station to the hotel. We arrived around noon and had to wait until 3 o'clock before getting our room. The rooms are small but with a little space around the bed. The breakfast is a ""make it your own"" type where you operate the juice machine and cofe machine yourself."
770,"It was an INSIDE job!! My husband and I came for a weekend stay 2 weeks ago for the Black & White Ball with 2 other couples. Got a phone call (on hotel phone line asking for us by name..only way this person would know who we were was if they worked there and that we had two rooms booked under our name) at 7:45am from a so-called shady sounding ""hotel manager"" who said our card wasn't working and that we needed to read them all our credit card information. So we did...fast forward 4 hours and Amex calls us to ask about some fraudulent charges being made. (in the thousand$!) When we confronted to hotel manager he was surprised, but told US to be the ones who should file a police report. We thus told him it was HIS JOB to do this, not ours. And the manger never followed up with us…"
771,"Stayed for three nights at Generator Berlin Mitte on a city break with a friend. It's in a great location for getting out and exploring the sites.  Rooms are a good size and stocked with everything you'd need - including a hairdryer and plenty of hooks which is always useful! Staff very friendly and helpful and the bar at Generator was ace. Totally recommend if you need an easy, clean base to explore Berlin."
772,Incorrect charges. Had to prove when I departed. Rude personnel. Restaurant slow and no one checked on us the entire meal. Too busy of an area. Too overcrowded. Overpriced. Try Marriott on fisherman's wharf.
773,"I'm not a picky hotel stayer: all I ask is for accommodation to be clean, comfortable, and in a good location. So, credit where credit is due Vilabranca was certainly the former. Our apartment was clean, spacious and pretty, and the reception staff were very friendly and helpful. Our party being aged 22-50 the 20 minute walk into town was perfect - pleasant, even - and several markets and restaurants closely surround the apartments, so the location was great. Unfortunately, that is where the positives end for us. So on to the negatives: every time we used the kettle or the hair dryer the electricity throughout the apartment would shut down. The first time it happened the receptionist turned it back on. The second, she replaced the kettle. Every other time we simply turned it…"
774,"First of all everyone I encountered in the hotel was incredibly helpful and pleasant, spoke English. My only complaint is that it's nearly impossible to effectively control the temperature of the room (the digital heat/ac didn't seem to work) and it got a bit chilly. Also, you must be VERY intimate with someone if you plan to share the room as the shower is IN the room with a glass door, that leaks onto the floor unless you shut the door very precisely. However, the room is adequately sized and does the trick. Hard to find better lodging for the price in that neighborhood. "
775,"Location is outstanding. Bedding (mattress & pillows) were very poor quality. Kitchen utensils were sparse (no flipper) and knives useless (blunt). Also a broken spring in the two seater lounge. Biggest issue was the odour that permeated the building for four of the days we stayed from the garbage in the basement and the garbage shute. The lifts, lift lobbies were worst with the lobby on the car park floor enough to make one of my family members physically gag on a number of occasions. I mentioned it to the reception people and all they said was that they would mention it to the owners."
776,"I travel almost 2 weeks of every month and stay in all types of hotels. This was my worst experience. The housekeeping staff just made the bed and changes the towels. Even empty shampoo bottles on the floor of the shower are not picked up.   Water is not free - be very careful. They charge 7 reals for a small bottle. It is better to pick up water from the small shop across the street. You find all this out when you are checking out and in a hurry.  11th floor had extremely hot water that can burn you. My friend was on 12th floor who had to take cold showers.  Laundry is another problem. The hotel info book in the room says if laundry is given before 10.00 am, it is returned the say day. The lady at the front desk says it is next day.   Hotel has a nice lobby bar. I sat there for…"
777,"I called the day before checking in and was assured that a rollaway bed would be ready.  Upon checking in, I was told that there were no more rollaway beds.  When I asked about the assurance the day prior, the attendant was unwilling to even look at the notes.  I left and was still charged for the room."
778,"DO NOT BOOK AN OCEAN VIEW ROOM WITH THIS HOTEL.  We forked over the extra $100 per night, and our ""ocean view"" turned out to be 90% pool and 10% ocean.  When we complained, we were told, ""Honestly this is the best room we have available right now for an ocean view.""  I did not pay extra for ""best available now,"" I paid extra for an ocean view.  EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING.  We were ultimately compensated our resort fee, which does not make up for the original difference in price."
779,"The Mark is not a romantic hotel. It is a hotel for those who seek value for their hard earned money. Don't come here for your wedding anniversary, but if you want a hotel that is well located, clean, with a decent breakfast and a comfy bed in Berlin. This is it. "
780,Obvious that this motel is in dire need of a revamp. Surprised with the $$ it costs to stay there that apparently none of it is put back into the upkeep of the motel. One of the house keepers smokes so expect your room to have a smokey smell to it...not that you can smell it much over the dank musty smell of the place. Toilet seat was so loose had to be careful not to fall off! Aircon while it worked may as well have a jet engine in the room with you! Shower door has a gap so try and close as much as possible or you end up with water everywhere which must be the cause of the rotting door frames on the bathroom floor! Bed covering looks like it has not been updated since the 1930s and the front desk were rather unhelpful! Ok location  but there are several place around for the…
781,We liked everything about the Cosmo Hotel. The bed is very comfortable and the room includes everything you could possibly want or need. We were upgraded to a suite and also had a lovely view of Berlin. Breakfast was outstanding. The staff was kind and most helpful. We were given help with directions to a Van Gogh exhibit and anything else we needed! It is near the UBahn and in walking distance of many sites.
783,"First the good things. The location is good within walking distance of city center offices. Rooms are nice.There is a gym with a nice view on the 19th Floor. And the breakfast is fine. Nice valet service at the reception.   Not so good: Passages look kind of old and dingy.   Bad : I got charged for 3 days more than 1 stayed. I called up 3 times. No one has replied as yet.  I am disappointed by this service especially because thus far, I have always liked staying at Homewoods properties."
784,"We stayed here for 2 nights and loved it! Although our room was small it was extremely comfortable and had everything we needed including a safe and small fridge cleverly hidden. The bathroom was superb, sparkling and easily accommodated the two of us. The shower was powerful with plenty of hot water and the toiletries were of good quality.   What stood out however were the staff who were exceptionally friendly, warm, welcoming and helpful. We were escorted to our room and shown how everything worked by a charming young woman who spoke perfect English. The reception and bar staff were also exemplary - whoever is responsible for their recruitment and training has done a great job.  The hotel is well situated near to public transport links and attractions are easily accessible.…"
785,"This hotel is quite modern, (no carpets, glass bricks in bathroom) and the staff are friendly.  The room was big (3 of us) with a large bathroom - I don't understand the trend for glass bricks into the bathroom, or no lock on the door.....especially when travelling with 2 sons.  But all was very clean.  Beds were quite hard, with pillows that were soft to the point of non-existant!    We had a 6th floor room overlooking the road, which was quite noisy.  We had the window open at night as quite warm (even in feb!) - the room faced the sun all day so even with the heating OFF it was warm.  There is however A/C.   The TV instructions said that the English channels were from 41 on; but the TV only recognised 1-40.    Didn't have breakfast, we bought food from the supermarket across…"
786,"Nice staff, nice gifts and friendly staff! Our new home whilst in Cannes! Central, modern, cool design and a nice spa! Great chill out area on the roof with pool and sun beds. Can def. recommend this hotel! "
787,"Internet was very slow - better to use 4G. Very nice breakfast with lots of different things to choose between, friendly staff most of the time. Capone restaurant on the ground Level serves very good pizza."
788,"A surly person worked the front desk for very limited time. and the expectations on the guest were like none i have experienced before, to supply their own toiletries after the first night, take out the garbage, deal with poor quality wifi, have no cell reception, no fresh linens, deal with nosy a/c and early than typical checkout. And if you had issues there was a number to call between 10 am and 10 pm. The location was nice, close to Millennium park and the building security staff that work for the building, NOT the hotel were pleasant and helpful, but they don't work for the hotel, so are not a positive reflection on the hotel"
789,Room...ugh TV didnt work when walked in No premium cable channels...zero not even one HBO or Max or Show. No Hulu or Netflix interface either Did green choice and they still tried to service my room- obviously great internal communication Bar bathroom is a mile away down the stairs from the bar 
790,We are booked in for 2 nights here and it is not going well.  Our room has a balcony and the door to the balcony is not secure the lock is broken.  Dinner has been a disaster. The main course had to be returned as the potato was cold. The Lomo steak was tough. My wife asked for a Diet Coke and no fresh glass was provided. Very poor. What star rating is this hotel?
791,"I had a pleasant stay at this location.   The hotel is not exactly close to the city center- it takes about 2 trams to get there, but it is doable .  The tram stops right in front of the hotel.  The room was clean and the bathroom renovated, however, my issue was with the details.     Similar to another review for this hotel, the safe did not work.   The front desk staff had to come to the room to manually open it a close it for it to be usable.   The chair by the seating area of the room was worn.  Only 2 bath towels were left in the bathroom for a room for 2 people. The bar does not sell hard liquor.  There is a supermarket a few blocks away.  The train to the airport is 1 Tram stop away or a short walk.  All and all the experience was not bad but could have been much better…"
792,"Visited for a little mini-moon break. Hotel was lovely and clean however we felt very over priced. As the hotel is a out of the city centre we had dinner twice at the hotel. For 2 mains (only burgers), 2 alcoholic drinks and a dessert was over €60. The food was lovely I must admit but for a burger I found €14.50 expensive. We opted to not pay €15 for breakfast but did buy a few crossiants from the shop downstairs, again 1 coffee and 3 crossiants was over €10.  The access into the city centre was easy enough with a little walk round the corner to the tram stop and about a 20 minute trip. The city is beautiful and we did everything we wanted to do. Google map was a saviour too! Would recommend the hotel if you don't mind splashing out as the hotel was clean and quiet. Perhaps if…"
793,"The rooms are tired and way overdue for a renovation. It's very dated and the maintenance is not good. Had to ask for a kettle and there was no plug for the bath tub, waited 45 minutes for this. Room service ok, but takes way to long to arrive, and the menu is limited."
794,"A great hotel in the centre of Berlin, few meters away form the station. Breakfast was good and room was cozy. I was on the 33rd floor, which gives you a great view from the hotel window. For a small charge u can go on the 37th floor for a picture view. Just a small negative note is that this hotel has over 1000 rooms so its all d time busy, lobby area always full with people."
795,A hotel with charme and history and lots of character. Great starting point to explore Berlin and especially Charlottenburg. Wonderful helpful and friendly staff. The cigar lounge/ bar is worth a trip on its own.
796,"I was there for one night but mixup hotel make me feel like I was there for weeks, very nice environment with artistic notes through the lobby and the rooms.. so polite stuff, so nice and comfortable rooms.. very close to the center of Berlin and near to the famous Berlin Wall, very nice option... "
797,"We were in the hotel just for a night (saturday to sunday) and everything was okay till we went to the room. The weather was hot and the air condition was not working properly... just heat! I called the reception and told them what was happening, they said to wait and see if it was working fine... waste of time! 10minutes after, called again and someone told me that the air condition was programed for winter so there was no possibility to refrigerate the room. So I had to sleep over 26ºC... The breakfast was poor and lack of choice... The hotel and rooms are modern, but who cares when you have no quality of sleep!? The location is okay, few minutes away from the downtown."
798,"I stayed in the hotel for 4 nights, first night in a room at the front on the first floor, which was very noisy (room 103) but as soon as I've asked to change room, the staff was very helpful and move me to quiet room. The staff are very helpful and friendly. The location is excellent - across the street from the Natural history Museum, near tramlines and underground, and short walk from the central train station. There are many cafes and bakeries near by for light breakfast.  The internet connection in the hotel was very bad and made it difficult to work (but the Vodafone hotspot worked very well, though with extra costs).  The room was very convenient and overall it was a very good base for meetings nearby"
801,"Staff was very helpful with daytickets for public transport. Nice, modern rooms. Hotel parking lot was full, so had to pay for parking at Ka-De-We. Breakfast at 09:30 was crowded, 10 mins waitingtime to be seated. "
802,I stayed in this hostel as it was very reasonably priced and in a good location. I stayed with friends and we booked a room with bunk beds so we didn't have to share a bed. The room was clean and modern and I like the fact you had a plug/USB charging port and light in your bunk. The staff were friendly and it had great ameinities. There is also a hair dryer in the bathroom.  It is right next to a Subway station only a couple of stops from Alexanderplatz and there are a lot of really great local places to eat and drink if you don't mind walking 5-10 minutes.   My only gripe was it is quite loud. I could hear the people above stomping around and the people next door taking through the walls. Don't forget your ear plugs.
803,"Recently my sister, husband and I stayed at this hotel. I booked a double room for three persons. When we arrived, we were informed that we were to share a king bed and if we wanted two beds we would have to upgrade at a cost of another 150.00 per night.  Our upgraded room gave us a view of a cesspool at the top of a building next door and the wall of another hotel-3rd floor. The Business dictionary defines a double room as a room with two beds. This hotel also charges $12.50 per day for internet PER DEVICE. So if you have an IPAD and an IPHONE hyou will be paying $25.00 per 24 hours period for internet. This hotel is a giant RIP OFF and I would not recommend it."
804,"I have no idea how this resort has an average 4/5 stars.  The decor is in serious need of updating and the rooms are scruffy and downright dirty. Our bed sheets had holes in them and our pillow cases were stained (see photos). The mattresses are about 5cm thick and after three nights my back ached from sleeping on them - I've had better and more peaceful sleeps on Vietnam's sleeper trains.  On our second morning, the staff came to clean our rooms and change our bed sheets BEFORE 9am - breakfast hadn't even finished and we were still in bed. Sadly, when they did change our sheets they replaced them with more stained pillowcases and ripped covers.  The bathroom was awful - the toilet seat was filthy (also see photos) and the tap was in a constant state of dripping when turned off…"
805,This hotel is fine for the super cool young crowd- it wasn't for me. Concrete everywhere. Too cool for school staff....but they were nice. Read reviews carefully because sometimes they are misleading.
807,The staff were nice but the room itself was not good.  The bathroom is way too small to the point if i was any bigger i wouldn't fit.  It was way too noisy and I heard every step and everything my neighbors and upstairs were doing. 
808,"The Hotel Palace Berlin is ideally situated in the heart of the shopping area of Berlin, facing the Tiergarten Zoo of Berlin. A building of 9 floors, wtih large rooms, nice bathrooms, furnished in a modern and comfortable style. The bathroom amenities are by the White Company and hotel service is good for this type of hotel. Comfortable bed. The breakfast buffet offers a range of cold cuts (in particular those German sausages) hams, smoked  salmon, herrings, mackerel, a large choice of cheeses, and traditional scrambled eggs, bacon, beans, etc... pastries, different birchermuesli and yogurts with fresh fruits salads. Fresh orange juices, apple juice, mutli vitamin.  Depending on the level of room chosen, guests may have access to the 7th floor lounge where breakfast, lunch, tea…"
809,"Fire alarm.  People evacuated into the street and there were no hotel engineers or staff available to guide people or direct guests upon exit from the building.  So everyone just kind of meandered around in the alley.  The crowd eventually walked around the building to the hotel front door.  The door man was asking guests if it was acceptable to go back in!  The front desk staff had no idea that their fire alarm was activated.  This highlighted that their process is not ready for an actual emergency, especially with a high-rise hotel.  Long elevator wait-times due to construction.  Plan an extra 5-10 minutes (no kidding) of delay waiting on the elevators.    Restaurant meal was, “meh” but the staff in the Platinum Lounge were very helpful.  Incredible Platinum Lounge; lots of…"
810,This great hostal is well located it will take you like 15 minutes to reach the city center by walking.  The staff is very friendly and they are always willing to help you.  The hostal has great facilities and is very clean.  Have a nice kitchen and a great pub in the roof top. 
811,"Very pricey place, decent rooms, nothing special but ok! No smells! Friendly staff, available free parking spaces. Big breakfast buffet, not the best but perfectly ok! I would return as the price matched what we got!"
812,"I’m really sorry that I have to leave a Negative review of this hotel.  Our stay at the Pestana Miramar Village Garden and Ocean Resort, was booked to celebrate our Diamond Wedding Anniversary. I went to great lengths to book the perfect holiday hotel and sadly like many other reviews, we were also very disappointed by the issues during our two week stay.   We had to complain about numerous problems, which is sad given that it could be a “Five Star” Hotel, if it was managed correctly. Our main complaint was the chaos and poor quality of the hot food for the evening meal. Whilst the “cold buffet” had an abundance of salads and cold vegetables, the meats and some fish dishes were very tough and dry, whilst hot vegetables were over-cooked. Their appearance was also very bland and…"
813,"This is a small (only 15 rooms) modern hotel in a good location. Originally it was a private residence and therefore doesn't flow like hotel should, I suppose you could call it quirky! Our suite was large, very comfortable and spotlessly clean with a lovely bathroom. The pool and spa was very pleasant for a small hotel. There was an underground car park which was very handy as it would have been very difficult to park nearby.  Unfortunately we found the staff to be rather surly, a little bit like they were doing you a favour!  We stayed four nights and on one of the nights we dined in the ABaC's 2 Michelin Star Restaurant (now 3 star) and had the 18 course tasting menu.  The meal was very good but unfortunately the restaurant lacked atmosphere due to other guests spending most…"
814,"Do not stay at this hotel! It is no where near a 4 star boutique hotel - but the worst part is that the hotel staff watched a drunk man harass my friend and I and did nothing. And they told me it was my fault, that it wasn’t their responsibility to do anything about it, and that I should have called the cops if I felt unsafe. Absolutely appalling. I’ve had better experiences at a motel 8."
815,"We arrived at the hotel very late. In the morning we were in a bit of a pinch and, as the rooms have no microwave, I went downstairs to see if there was any way to heat up milk for my daughter. I was told by an employee, MADI, that there was no microwave in the building and no way to heat up my milk, which of course isn't true. Luckily, another employee who did possess a brain in their head witnessed the encounter and offered to help. I do have to wonder what kind of human being refuses to take a few seconds out of their day to help a child, not to mention that we were part of a group that rented maybe 100 rooms for a couple of nights. We travel globally on a bi-monthly basis. As such, we stay in a lot of hotels and this is the first time I've been refused help when needing to…"
817,"We left the hotel today after a 10 day stay. We have travelled to Lagos a few times and adore it but this will be our first and last stay at Vila Gale.   Having paid quite a bit of money for our holiday, I do not feel that I got what I paid for and there was nothing exceptional about the hotel or our stay.   Firstly, we paid extra for a sea view room, I would hardly call the room a sea view. The rooms are basic with twin beds. They don’t have an iron or kettle (you have to request a kettle but they are always short of them). Going out in a creased dress is not great. The rooms lacked the basics of what you would expect from a hotel stay, especially a 10 day stay.  Location is good, a two minute walk over the road to a beach and a 10 minute walk into the town. Taxis are really…"
818,"we have now stayed at this hotel twice, to start with the location is excelent as it is just around the corner are the U and S bahn's  The hotel is lovely and clean and the concierge friendly and efficient, the rooms have plenty of space. The breakfast is very good but rather pricey at 19 Euro  There are plenty of local very good restaurants and a wonderful theatre across the road.  The lobby, reception and lift area unfortunately smell very strongly with smoke which is due to the cigar room attached to reception"
819,"This is turning out to be a trip from Hell. Paid for vista level so we could sit out on our lanai , and it's been constant cigarette smoke wafting in. We've complained 3 times but nothing they can do. Now my husband and I are suffering with sore throats and have to keep our balcony closed. Not to mention there is a drone flying outside our balcony. It's just so upsetting to pay for a nice room we can't even use and we're stuck here for 2 more days. "
820,"Upon arrival I was informed that there was a problem with air conditioning leaking and they had moved me to another owned hotel down the block.   Le Jardin.   It was easy, my room was ready and the front desk was very helpful.  I was able to return to the Hotel Royal Le Rive Gauche the next day, as the problem was fixed!  Automatically I was told I was getting an upgrade; without even asking.  Wow!  Front desk was awesome - the room was very nice & comfortable and breakfast was varied and delicious!   I will definitely go back and recommend both properties!  Bravo!"
821,"This hotel was clean, tidy and the perfect place for a city stay The hotel has great transport links and easy to get around from here Shops and restaurants are nearby and hotel breakfast was good Staff were very helpful "
824,Nice boutique hotel in awesome location across from waterfront plaza. Nice decor with wood accents. Cozy lobby for reading and relaxing. However a few caveats: the two tiny separate elevators (in different parts of hotel) are way too small and slow - sadly typical for smaller European hotels. The rooms are modest in size for the price - compared to North American standards - although the bathrooms are very spacious. We had problems with the tap being loose and sink not draining properly. Staff were friendly and helpful. Restaurant in the hotel was nice although it is a meat restaurant not great for vegetarians (it *is* Portugal!). Shopping close by. 
825,"Great view and location next to a shopping mall, but very old fashioned furnishings in need of modernization. all activities and timetables suited for 65+ and an abundant but not very high quality buffet.  "
826,"Great location, the staff has been adorable, super comfy room (I had a free upgrade to a fantastic suit just under the roof of the building, great value for money and most of all you can experience a very personal touch which is not easy to find in Paris       "
827,"excellent hotel, clean friendly ideally situated to the eurostar, and metro, so quite you would not know you were in a city.  Breakfast was tasty and there was always plenty of choice. i cannot recommend highly enough"
829,"This disgusting hotel has nothing special about it, and if you are staying in San Fransisco for quite a while I do NOT recommend staying here. My room was not nice and my brother and I wouldn't sleep underneath the sheets because it stunk. It smells like a hospital and looks like one too. When you walk outside, you don't feel safe at all as there are mental people all around and it's such a dodgy area. In fact, they lock the door because the staff are even scared themselves. I knew that it would be bad but not this bad. It is close to most places that we wanted to go to, but I am never going back ever again. "
830,"I had two recent experiences at the Plaza Hotel Grill. The first one was a dinner with an American friend my wife and I (both Argentines) wanted to entertain. My wife ordered fish and I asked for a steak. BOTH WERE DREADFUL. Our friend, out of courtesy, did not say anything but from some hints he made it was obvious that he was not satisfied. The fish was hard as a rock, absolutely tasteless. The beef (in Argentina!) was terrible: it had no taste, also hard as rock, ill cooked, dry. I made a promise never to go back. Service was OK, but it was impossible to hide the fact that even the waiter realized that what he was serving was not up to the Plaza standards, and more fit for a far away roadside restaurant. Yet, a few weeks ago a business associate invited me over for lunch. We…"
831,"Beautiful hotel, very different to anywhere I've stayed before! Staff were very polite and helpful when we asked where places were, even at 10pm trying to direct us to a 24 hour pharmacy in the pouring rain! Gorgeous room, we had the upgraded Sloth room with an amazing bathroom. Room was cleaned with fresh bedding and towels everyday! Great selection of foods for breakfast each morning! Couldn't fault the hotel at all :) "
832,"We made our reservation throughou a  travel agent who confirmed that we will have  free parking privilege with our reservation,  we arrived at 7:12 pm at the front desk, the guy at front desk  declined our privilege so we asked to talk to his manager "" milk"", the manger didn't help us at all and actually he made things so difficult, my wife was so tired because of her pregnancy, we spent 2 hrs at the front desk before we paid again for the parks nag privilege ): the expirence was so bad and I don't recommend this place to any one ):"
833,"Stayed 5 nights August 2018.  We liked the hotel.  The square the hotel is on is so-so.  Not dangerous, but not attractive.  There's a triangular plaza in front of the hotel with a monument and benches.  The building adjacent to the hotel is abandoned and there are homeless people sleeping in front of the building.  We never felt unsafe, but it was not uplifting to return to the hotel at night (after dinner) and see people sleeping in front of abandoned building on cardboard (and urinating there too).  We're not prudes, not this was a turn off.  The hotel inside is quite nice and modern.  The front desk staff are awesome (especially Pedro!!!). The inside entrance is lovely as is the breakfast room adjacent to the entrance.  The included breakfast was wonderful! A nice way to…"
836,"I had a room on ninth floor which is apparently better than others for space, wifi and furnishings but I was less than impressed. We were a very large group and about forty people hit the bar after a dinner - nightmare as there was only one very slow barman for a long time and it took ages to get served. "
837,"Very rude reception at the front desk from an employee named Grace. They did not provide keys for  the right room and I had to deal with a paranoid receptionist who said, she will clean up the room , after we just stepped into it. And all of this , only to find out they didn’t alot the right room. Please show  some compassion and courtesy with your guests."
838,"Pros: excellent breakfast, good location Cons: horrid customer service. Lalit front desk staff is completely incompetent and useless. They act aloof and unhelpful. Upon check in we were given a room overlooking live music event/loud outdoor party after specifically asking for a quiet room. Then we had to switch rooms in the middle of the night after we woke up by loud drumming. Next room we were offered was much smaller on a lower floor and overlooked a brick wall. We wanted quiet but not a bunker room. We had to go in person in pajamas downstairs to the front desk to have it resolved. That was after 14 hour flight and no sleep in over 20h. Finally the third room we were given was OK. The following day we had more issues with hotel staff - we had to call 4 times to get what we…"
839,"We stayed at the Holiday Inn Chicago O'Hare area on July 25th. Our flight arrived at 11 AM so naturally our room wasn't ready yet. We checked our bags with the front desk & went downtown for the day. We arrived back at the hotel around 1030 PM & collected our bags & checked in & went to bed because we had a morning return flight home. Upon opening our bags the next morning, my husbands 3 days old $350 Beats by Dre headphones were no longer in his bag. We complained at the front desk & then had to leave to catch a flight. Later that day I spoke with the front desk manager who was turning the case over to the Lakhani Hospitality HR staff. A few days later I was contacted, I sent copies of our receipts showing were the headphones had been delivered 3 days before the trip & the…"
840,"Quiet, simple hotel, breakfast available but nothing else. No air conditioning in the summer. Helpful reception, closes at 10.30 pm, enter hotel afterwards with your key   Walk 5 minutes to nearest U Bahn, close to City Center. two supermarkets steps away."
841,"We have been travelling for the last 30 days around Europe from sri Lanka to UK and Europe, and this place is what you call home..  These people relate to their guests!!!  They made us feel soo at home and made us feel so comfortable...and this is what you need when one has been travelling with a toddler for over a month!!! Rooms was soo clean. And the front office staff always made sure we felt comfortable.... this place is a little gem. We will definitely be back.. thank you... "
842,"Pros: Great bbq's for grilling out and a nice little poolside tiki bar. Rooms had a beautiful view of the ocean.   Cons: There were cockroaches in our room and in the room of another member of our party; the staff acted as if this were normal. Also, the beach was unusable for swimming."
843,"Very enjoyable stay at this comfortable hotel, we will definitely return. Good location for seeing the city, friendly, approachable staff. We had an excellent breakfast one morning in the hotel. Highly recommend."
844,"Worst hotel experience in my life. The lobby reeked of perfume that made my throat burn (they called it a welcoming gesture), the room was so small and poorly laid out that it barely fit my luggage, and it's just a cheaply constructed hotel with a modern gimmicky twist. No parking or valet, the neighborhood is covered in literal feces and urine, I was offered drugs multiple times when I tried to walk to a store. Walls are paper thin, light switches work about half the time, the bathroom isn't totally separate from the bedroom (so embarrassing for a couple and not hygienic). We could barely sleep, the bed was so uncomfortable and the pillows were like inflatable camping pillows. A laundry truck banged so loud at 2am that it shook my room and I thought a bomb had gone off (they…"
845,"My family and I booked a package deal with this hotel, we were very happy with the quality and design of the room. The hotel is modern, very clean and was good value.  The location is on the East Side, we would have preferred to stay somewhere more central. It is a little walk from the station, maybe 10 - 15 mins as you have to walk around some buildings or go under a bridge which took a little longer as we had kids. Located right next to the Mercedes Arena and part of the wall. It would be ideal for those wanting to explore the East Side. There are some good fast food options nearby with lots of restaurants further, across the bridge. Breakfast was ok, a little limited and repetitive."
846,"The location of the hotel is the best! Everything is so close and also the metro station is outside the hotel.  Breakfast was good, with local dishes which was an unexpected surprise. The price is a little bit expensive but it was ok because everything was close to us and the rooms were very clean. "
847,"Long wait in the check in and check out counter. Staff are friendly but inefficient. Room is spacious and clean. But, Air con was not working well. Wifi was complementary. Price was fair for business travelers. Not an ideal place to stay for vacation."
848,"Hotel booked with a great group of friends we have travelled with on several occasions. Hotel in good location. No parking at Hotel, no street level bar and currently undergoing overdue upgrading. Classed as 5 star currently is unfair. It is 4 . Rooms on Street side are too noisy from traffic. Balcony rooms on 2nd floor are silly small with no table. Again very noisy to sit out and not very private. No daily water provided and rooms are small. Drilling noises heard on weekdays and started from 8am one morning. Staff were very friendly, helpful and polite. Food average. Balcony ok but overrated, can be very windy."
851,"We had a family holiday in Porto. Apartment is very clean but we had small problems everyday. First day we could not open the door. The card was very slow and complicated. They changed but then we could not open the parking gate. Then we got a new card and at the end all cards were functioning. It was complicated to cook a coffee. The machine needed a special kind and it was not written so we bought another one. The kitchen is modern but there were not enough glasses. We needed two for the bathroom thats why we had no enough in the room. We bought different stuff to clean the kitchen and floor because there was nothing in the kitchen. Sorry, these are small things but sometimes important. Receptionists are nice and helpfull but we didnt want to disturb them for everything only…"
853,"Rubbish hotel unless your a celebrity. I was 6mths pregnant when we stayed here. They lost our luggage and didn’t give a damn. Staff weren’t interested and were very aloof!! I think if your famous or very beautiful then it will be a different attitude altogether.  Room was nice, the cabanas were very expensive. Good location but really not worth it"
854,"This hotel is very impressive at the first step in due to the great location and stunning lob / reception. It is giant with a small mall, lobby bar and so on. Huge and nice reception with modern decoration. But wait until get to your room, it is awful to expect a Sheraton standard room and to get a very old room. Furniture, appliances, cleanliness... complete overhaul is needed. You'll get pretty good room in less expensive hotels in BAs for sure."
856,"This hotel (although it should be described as a motel that also sells bottles of wines) leaves much to be desired. This is a small hotel in a noisy street away from desirable areas in Buenos Aires. The rooms and bathrooms were small and uncomfortable, with worn out furnishings. Towels and sheets were worn out and paper thin. A couple of the staff were friendly but that cannot be said of everyone. The empanadas are just ordinary, not great as some reviewers have stated. Perhaps the absentee owner needs to pay a visit. Tip: breakfast is small and uninspired but do not get there a minute late or you will not be served. "
857,"We stayed here in late October for two nights. We booked 2 beds in 6-bed room. Lovely hostel with great service. Friendly and helpful staff (thanks, guys!). Our room was basic, but very clean. Bathroom was ok. Really nice common areas. Good location as well. Highly recommended!"
858,"Very friendly staff, reception staff speak great English, rooms finished to a good standard. Its safe to say this hotel is not complete currently so loud building work goes on throughout the day. The only way of sleeping through the night for myself is with earplugs as the windows are single glazed and the road noise is extremely loud on the front. The back of the hotel is way better for noise although there's a dog that barks all night.  Having the air conditioning on while trying to sleep is not an option as it sounds like a jumbo jet taking off, currently its winter here but still fairly hot so its not so bad without it, i could imagine staying here in summer would be horrendous with the road noise/dog/noise from other rooms/air-con combo."
859,"This was one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. Here is a list of the negatives: not all the electric outlets worked nor all the lamps, the wallpaper in the room and bathroom was peeling, the carpet is not installed nicely and left lumps and tripping hazards, cracked and moldy tiles in the bathroom, FLIES everywhere, the place had a decidedly not well kept up feel, you could hear EVERYTHING, the toilets randomly run in the middle of the night waking you out of a dead sleep, there was no information about the hotel in the room, aside from a tablet that was difficult to navigate, the hotel staff didn't know anything about the breakfast that I added to the room (I talked to 3 front desk members, the text messages and a concierge before finding ANYTHING out). All in all this…"
860,"We enjoyed a two night stay in this extremely clean and well located hotel. The ensuite was very modern with a powerful shower and the room was quiet despite being at the front of the hotel. We chose to have breakfast at one of the many cafes nearby at a fraction of the price that the hotel were charging so with only the room to pay for, it proved to be an inexpensive and ideal choice of hotel."
861,The room was very comfortable and the hotel has an amazing location. The breakfast spread is large and recommended. The hotel is right on the main road and a two major metro stations in walking distance makes it easy to commute.
862,"The hotel is plush, if a little dated in appearances, and is set in a lovely location on a smart road with trees. There are also services in the building - Starbucks, a couple of restaurants and shops, it's very convenient.   The rooms are ok, a bit dated but fine - like the other 2 hotels I stayed in on this trip to China, the walls and doors were very thin and the noise from the corridor and adjacent rooms woke me up a few times.  The service was very poor - check in seemed to take forever, being in a deluxe room actually slows things down as you need to go through an extended process downstairs and then again at the lounge upstairs. Staff were polite but completely clueless. Check out was just as bad as were things like arranging taxis or getting a drink - everything took…"
864,Mediocre stay. Place you to be a lot better and the staff was more responsive. Now they basically acknowledge your staying there! The place used to be fabulos and the staff used to make an effort. I guess now to the staff it's just become a job and just another day.
865,The Bairro Alto Hotel as the name says is located in the top of the hill at Camoes Square at the Chiado area of Lisbon. Very good location at a walking distance of the historic center and other relevant touristic areas of Lisbon. You also find nice restaurants and cafes nearby it. The Hotel itself is old but well kept. The rooms are small but nice. The restaurant Flores is poor and small to the size of the hotel. But the bar on the top is very good with a nice 360º view of Lisbon. It is a Leading Hotel but not at the same level of other hotels of LHW.
866,Never ever stay at this hotel because of the location. We stayed here for two nights as part of an organised tour so had no option to chose accommodation in San Francisco. This hotel was allocated and I wished we had had option to choose our own accommodation as after seeing reviews was very dubious about it and I was right to be.  The only positive I can express is that the staff were great but everything else dreadful.  I totally agree with all the reviews regarding bad location with the surrounding area swarming with the homeless community/gangs of people hanging around which felt very intimidating so much that we were unprepared to walk back to the hotel in the evenings as felt very unsafe. There is a Starbucks attached to foyer area and even the staff in there we spoke to…
867,"We stayed there for 10 days and the Hotel is very well located, the breakfast is very good and services are nice and people very warm. The restaurant at night is not the best option but near by there are several other options. I would stay again in another trip to Berlin."
868,"Stayed here for a few nights during July to celebrate a birthday.  After a late night flight we arrived at approx 23:00 and were pleasantry surprised by the lovely reception area.  We took the lift to our room, which again was quiet and of a good size.  You could not tell how close we were to the main road.  Air con was great during the hot weather.  Facilities all in working order and clean.  Location spot on and walking distance to various sites and restaurants, not to mention transport links.  Only downside was that the housekeeping service woke us up at 9am which we didn't think we would need a do not disturb sign up for.   This being said we would certainly return, good price for a lovely hotel."
869,We booked this apartment as we were travelling with an 8 month old baby so found the facilities very useful. Location was great in a nice busy district which was within walking distance of the market and the beach (about 30 mins stroll). There is also a metro station nearby and bus stops. Plenty of upmarket and high street stores on your doorstep if you fancy a day of shopping. And there is a 24 hour mini market should you need to pick up any essentials. Will definitely book again if ever in Barcelona!
870,Décor was quirky in a fun way and the deluxe room very large in a quiet courtyard. Breakfast was excellent both in quantity and quality. The restaurant was OK but not very imaginative and others in the area offered better value. The staff were very helpful.  Although on the edge of the old East Germany there were plenty of historical museums nearby to visit and the river (with tours) close by. We also enjoyed walking locally. Transport was excellent being cheap with frequent buses and underground trains to all of Berlin.  We will be happy tor return.
871,"+ Good breakfast, decent selection of foods for different tastes + Convenient location + An eletric kettle available in the room + Restaurant staff were positive, polite and helpful + Three spacious lifts  - Unfriendly, disinterested front desk, receptionists always seemed bothered when addressed. The guy who checked me in, didn`t give any information about possibilities  I had in the hotel (like free sauna, for example). No smile, no polite expressions people are used to hear in hotels to feel welcomed. - Hotel has one public wi-fi network, which isn`t secured even with a password, in my room the signal was too weak for my phone to actually connect to it. I asked for some solution to this problem, as I needed to use internet, the receptionist said he will look into it, but we…"
873,"Very well located, considering the dimensions in Paris, nice neighbourhood, easy access with metro and lots of shops around. The rooms are clean and well furnished, the personal gentle. And we got a nice offer. Couldn't wish more."
874,"Located directly at s/u station Gesundbrunnen with good access to Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg, Friedrichshain, Kreuzberg, airport Tegel and airport Schönefeld. 24h reception/bar serving food and drinks all day and night. Spacious, modern lounge. Staff was very friendly. Our room had a super comfortable bed and was spotless clean (toiletries were provided). Very good value for the money. Perfect, if you are looking for an international hostel atmosphere, but don't want to miss the comfort of a hotel. "
875,"Nice small hotel in the middle of the city. Room on floor 3 was clean, quiet and with a view towards the Canal St Martin. Breakfast kept the hunger away for several hours. Staff was helpful and in a good mood."
876,"Stayed there for 2 nights. Internet wasn't free, so used my own ""3"" SIM card. Breakfast seemed to be okay - I didn't used one, since I went to McD both mornings (which I thought was a better value). Just 500 meter from Microsoft Office. The hotel was typical IBIS. It looked decent and clean. Though in my room I found someones socks in a very visible place. How did the cleaners missed it is beyond me. Flat screen TV. Gas station "" Statoil"" near by, where you can get food etc. at almost any time of the day. Metro station about 10 minutes walk. Not hotels fault, but to get to the airport you have to travel with Metro to City Center and then take Flybussaras bus back (you pretty much do same distance to city like it would take you to the airport. The Taxi price to the airport are…"
878,"I was here for a week on business and was not impressed. The rooms were tired and in need of an update. The rooms were extremely hot and there was no air-con (despite what it says on certain websites) so the ceiling fan was going 24/7 as it was too noisy to sleep with the window open. The hotel stank of fish in the afternoons (due to being next to a fish restaurant) and the smell seeped into the rooms, which was pretty unpleasant. It was a bit hit and miss about the water temperature in the mornings and the water pressure wasn't reliable. The fact that the hotel has no facilities - cafe, restaurant or gym is a real drawback when staying there for a week. As a final irritation I offered to pay for a bottle of water at reception when I was checking out and was told I could have it…"
879,Room was the equivalent of a motel inside a hotel. The location is great because it right downtown. But honestly after looking at those walls it’s very depressing along with the mysterious items on the drying towel! One runner to get valet cars was frustrating as it seem to take a lot of time to get our car from valet. The carpet in the room was the equivalent of your grandmas green carpet that has been there since you were young and it was old when you were young!
880,"I have been coming here for over 40 years with my family as a child and have continued the tradition with my own children..still a hidden gem. Old charm hotel that is so close to the metro, buses and the etoile. A quiet location on a side street but not even a 5 minute walk from the Champs Elysee. Great continental breakfast that is just enough. Friendly staff that are very helpful. My mom had spoken to Giorgia several times before our arrival regarding our booking but unfortunately she was not working during our stay. Hopefully we will meet next time."
881,"To be fair, the client chose this hotel and I checked in at 10pm and checked out at 7am the next morning.  I did venture to the bar but only had one drink and left... It was not entirely relaxing and the whisky collection was disappointing.  The room was big and it was clean.  Breakfast was also decent.  The two stars is somewhat unfair but in the event I return to Shanghai, I cannot see myself returning to this hotel."
882,"Hello folks, we are back in Chicago for the weekend picking up our daughter from college. We stayed at the Hilton Chicago and let me tell you, the location is great and the hotel is very clean and pleasant however, for some reason this hotel’s check in process was very loooong...it took us over an hour to get checked in and that is as a diamond Honors member. The staff is not very knowledgeable of their floors (she said there was only one bathroom in our room but there were two). So for us the positive aspects of the Hilton Chicago are taken away by the inefficient customer service provided by the front desk. FYI the floor manager “Audrey” can use some customer service training. This will be the last time we use this location. All I can say to my readers is that, if you have an…"
883,"Very responsiveness staff and clean room.  They prepared me quiet room as I wish.  Standard french breakfast.  Good wifi signal, but you need reconect each day.   Very close to store, subway and also nice neighborhood."
884,"Spacious room, very clean, friendly staff, good and free of charge wifi.   Not much more than 10 mins to the airport and 15 mins to the city center. The hotel is directly in the entry lane of the airport and close to a quite noisy roundabout. ATM, shops, restaurants and the Metro are nearby. "
885,"Our room was lovely and the hotel showed us exceptional service. All the staff members were helpful which made our stay even better. The hotel was in a great location. Only a few minutes walk from the Arc De Triomphe. I want to thank Anna, Michele and youssef for making our stay wonderful. When i next visit Paris, i will definitely be staying at the hotel. Thank you!"
886,"I arrived late at night as a long layover in Paris. The staff was friendly, the bed was comfortable and the location was fantastic. I was able to see the Eiffel Tower before going back to the airport. "
887,"Myself and my partner visited Paris for the first time over valentines. We found the hotel to be in a perfect location as it was within walking distance of the main train station Gare de Nord with trains coming straight from the airport to the station. It also had great metro links with the local station cadet allowing you to travel around all the main areas. Although at first it was hard to figure out the routes with the information desk in the metro station not having any English speaking representatives, however the staff at Les plumes were so helpful in explaining where we needed to go to and from. All the staff we had the pleasure of communicating with spoke excellent English and were able to assist us in all our queries and questions. The hotel is surrounded by plenty of…"
888,"Why I said ""unforgettable experience""?  First, staff's attitude cannot be worse. I came to the hotel at noon, felt hot and thirsty but what I received was just a smile from the receptionist. No cold tissue and no water for welcome. I asked for a drink twice, and after 15 minutes they brought us three cups of super-hot tea. Once again, I asked for ice then she said ""my hotel does not have ice"". It's so funnyyyyyyy!!!!!   Also, the waitress at hotel's bar had poor manner. It seemed like she felt irritated all the time.  Second, the room is not qualified for three-star quality. It's too small and poor sound-proofing. Water system was not good as well.  Third, price for service was irrational. I was charged more than 80,000 VND for a little cup of fresh orange. However, food at…"
889,"Nice hotel,  good located in the shopping centre of Berlin. Easy to travel by U - S bahn from the airport . The room was nice and clean, and it is very quiet with no noice from the traffic. Bar and restaurant located in the hotel."
890,"Booked this place last minute after our flight home got cancelled and payed €55 for a 3 bed room. Really friendly and accommodating staff, friends unimpressed with bunk bed and said not as clean as they would like but I had no issues. Not dirty and the rooms are basic but for that price it's to be expected. Really good shower and so glad of a comfy bed near the airport free a horrendous day. Would recommend to anyone needing to stay near the airport. "
891,It's ok but you can get as good as more central. There is an amazing Brazilian restaurant opposite that is well worth a visit. The hotel was full and not enough staff or places for breakfast. We went back to our room for half an hour. The pool is much smaller than it looks in the photos. However the staff are friendly. The room facilities are good and if you want somewhere close to airport or you're happy to use metro to get downtown it's a good option 
892,"excellent location, very nice personnel, studios not ss big as on pictures but good, well equipped, excellent value for money, very dog-friendly with many green areas around, a place you can call home for few days"
893,"Awful that's the only thing I have to say it's plain awful. Unfortunately , I was extremely disappointed in the behavior of the staff at this location. I felt unsafe at times and wish we stayed at another location"
894,"Room is spacious and Modern. Bed is very clean and comfortable. Check-in is real fast. Reception is very helpful. Location is very central and walking distance from Alexnaderplatz train station. Highly recommended. All in all, a very good stay. (Cost saving info: If you want to save few euro from breakfast, you can get it from the hotel beside (H2) at 10 Euro...oops, sorry H4 ;~i still love you and will stay again once I’m in Berlin. "
895,"i am writing this review on last night i stayed in Paris. This hotel is the best hotel that i can imagine on the price level in the expensive city of Paris. Located near Jacques Bonsergent Metro station and bus station, it is perfectly located in central of Paris. You can move around easily using public transport near the hotel. Front officer really polite, helpful and informative even though they have a hard time speaking in english but they have a good intention to be polite and helpful to their guest. There is nothing more i can say about this hotel, and i will definitely go back to this hotel if i visit Paris again. Thank you for your service and a good sleep Ps : you might need to work on your heater on room 301, its not working too well but its okay."
896,"This hotel was a very nice and quaint hotel. The staff was very helpful and nice. It is very conveniently located. If i ever come back to Berlin, i will be sure to stay at this hotel. I defintiely recommend this hotel!"
897,"Our stay is super disappointing. The hotel looks nice on the Internet and gets pretty good reviews, but we have not been impressed. We are a family of five that had 2 rooms, both facing some overgrown backyard and facing some ugly apartment buildings where dogs bark in the morning. Our first morning here, we thought we’d try breakfast at the hotel, HUGE mistake. Expensive and we were almost done eating our cold bacon and eggs before the waitress came to take an order for the kitchen. Before she finally showed up, I asked at the hostess stand how to order from the menu, at that point, we hadn’t seen a waitress. She literally explained how to ordered from a menu, then promptly turned away from me to stare at the lobby area. I was a waitress when I was younger and did not…"
898,From the moment of arrival this hotel was excellent.  Upgraded without even asking and at no extra cost to a king size room . The rooms are comfortable and very modern. The breakfast every morning was amazing.. buffet with so many choices. The staff are so polite and accommodating . The only thing I could say negative was they did not refill the coffee every day however when asked coffee was always sent up to the room . This hotel is amazing and when we visit Berlin again we will be staying here ..
899,"Place is good: near u-Bahn. Some bus stop near hotel. There is supermarket in 30 seconds from Ibis hotel/budget. Room is not too small. I would say it is tidy. Our window was to street, so we heared loud from cleaning mashines and other transport. Room is very clean. There are only towels, soap and shower gel/shampoo. You can also get hair dryer for deposite. 3-rd bed could be useful if you travel with your child. I like Ibis hotels, but I will try to find more cheaper room next time."
900,The room was nice. But we requested a twin size bed. And we had 2 single size beds instead. The beds kept moving apart during the night. Next to that we had a late checkout because we visited a ADE event until 8 in the morning. But the cleaning service disturbed our sleep from 13.30 to 16.00. The rest of the service was allright 
901,"Check in was friendly and efficient, we were allocated a disabled room which was larger than we expected and very comfortable.  The hotel is a stones throw from Spittlemarkt U Bahn station and well located for the Alexanderplatz and Gendermenmarkt christmas markets which are two of the larger markets.  Great value at £65 per night, we didn't have breakfast as we felt it was a bit on the expensive side, there are plenty of cafes in the area which are better value.  Would certainly stay again if in Berlin."
902,"This hotel is perfect for first timers in Paris! Rooms were very clean and facilities were much better than expected considering the price. Right on the arc's and champs-elysees doorstep. It's across the street from the underground which is excellent and safe even at night.  But by far the best feature of the hotel was the amazing staff.  Sabri in particular was a gem, I had mistakenly booked my reservation late by a month and he was able to contact management and sort our booking out with no extra cost! Would be a pleasure to come back!  P.S. This area of Paris has the best French bistro - Le Hide. A must try but book in advance as it gets booked up quite fast. "
903,"Overall, I give this hotel a high rating. Large, well appointed room. Very comfy bed, quality linens. Pretty good location, if somewhat boring. 50 feet from the subway, so transportation is very easy. Excellent front desk staff and the concierge service is top notch. I, of course, left my electricity converter and umbrella at home. Both were provided quickly, no charge. The included breakfast is decent, nothing memorable, but a very wide selection - hot, cold, cheeses, breads, fruit, meuseli. Plenty to choose from across all tastes. The only unpleasant experience I had was my first night, attempting to have a bite to eat and deal with jet lag. The lobby bar was closed for some reason, even though it was scheduled to be open. I went to the Catwalk Bar as the sign in the lobby…"
904,"No desks are present in the rooms of this business hotel. When I asked for a desk and chair to be sent up, I received a stained portable table that are usually used for outdoor picnics. I refused the table and will be checking out of the hotel."
905,"I made a reservation online for this hotel and it was clearly not very occupied as most hotels aren't in January.   I reserved a Waldorf suite and was checking in on the app and was upgraded to an Astoria Suite.  I was preassigned a room and unable to change it after having called numerous times to request the capability to choose my room and denied this request without a reason being given.  I was given room 2210. The room looked like it was surprised.  The paint was scratched, the carpets were discolored, there was dust everywhere and it looked disheveled.  I called to ask if another room was available and after a lot of prodding and looking I asked to upgrade again thinking the WA rooms were pretty crappy for 650/night.   I upgraded to a luxury suite.  And there wasn't a…"
906,"This is the first time I’ve stayed at this hotel, as I usually have to stay at the bikini hotel. I prefer this hotel much better, and will definitely return. Location is good for the centre of Berlin.  Decor is more luxurious in the reception areas and in the bathrooms. High level of finish and materials have been used in the bathrooms and throughout the hotel. Beds are a great size and comfortable. Even though my room was by the elevator it was well insulated so it didn’t disturb me. Nespresso machines in the room are a nice touch. None of the TV channels are in English, just a heads up if you like to tune into international news. Didn’t try the breakfast so can’t comment about that, though colleagues said it was good. Check in and out process was smooth and quick. Didn’t have…"
907,The design of the hotel is really nice and the bar is nice too. But our guest room looked very used and really needs a fresch up. Furthermore we could hear every noice other guest in the room around us made. We did not like the shower in the middle of the room but thaf was just out impression and perhaps other people like that.
908,"We just came back from Berlin yesterday and stay at this hotel. centrally located near all the main attractions and  5min walk to the Alexander platz station . We landed at Schönefeld airport and took the re7 train, 35 min to Alexander platz  at the cost of 3.4 euro. You can find everything that you want near Alexander platz, good restaurants, Christmas markets ,shopping ,train, bus. We ware upgraded to a bigger room, the staff were very helpful. The hotel is very clean,good breakfast . Highly recommended"
909,"I know there is a strike on with hotel workers at the moment but my experience of this hotel was far from good. Lack of attention to day to day maintenance issues - peeling wallpaper, bath that was at the end of of life and tired and flexed, shower head did not spray and was old and tarnished - need I say more. The hotel lobby and location were its saving elements. Would not recommend. "
910,"We like the design of the Puli and the Long Bar concept where Check-in and your first drink are just served over the same long counter. But here is the problem: If you expect a good host at the other side of that counter you are mistaken.  We waited for the drink list while other people were seated and got their menu before us. Finally I got to order a Single Malt for 118 Yuan, after 5 minutes the waiter returned just to ask me if I want it with ice(!) After another 5 Minutes he arrived with the glass. I could hardly recognize the content. There was just a very tiny sip in it just covering the bottom of the glass. I ask the bar keeper about it and his rude answer was: ""Want a double""? My wife's Pina Colada wasn't better. Lots of ice and no alcohol could be tasted. We went on to…"
911,"This property is currently under major construction right now. The room itself was renovated but it seemed like not much thought went into the renovation.  They did what they could the space. There are heaps of debris around property, open gapping stairwells, etc.  The staff here is friendly, great coffee and great location in general. If you're simply looking for a budget hotel in a great location, this place would suffice."
912,"Our tour group arrived at 5:45 PM; later than expected.  After being at the desk for some minutes, our tour director was told that our rooms were not ready.  That was discouraging.  We waited some more.  The people at the desk did not seem over anxious.  Then they thought they could put us on another floor and give us a drink while the rooms were cleaned. We thought they just wanted us out of the lobby.  Our luggage had been unloaded from the bus and put somewhere.  Finally, we got our rooms and then waited another hour for the luggage to arrive.  At bath time, we discovered we had no large towels but instead we had robes for the spa.  This was not impressive.  The next morning the cleaning people were cleaning rooms on our floor at an early hour and chatting loudly.   On the…"
913,"Suitable for a group of friends. Easy location, metro stop and walking distance to sights. Shop near the apartment. Balcony nice, even straight to the street. Street sounds belonged to the apartment. Air conditioning good."
914,"Volcano View is a wonderfully property with knockout views and a friendly staff. We made some wonderful friends amongst the staff here. Sad to say, our stay here was let down by several things:  - Lack of WIFI: We arrived during a bank holiday weekend. WIFI was only available sporadically throughout our stay and only in the lobby and restaurant, which was very disappointing. Even in the hotel lobby, reception was hit & miss. This made it very difficult and frustrating to attend to business emails during our stay. I know what you're thinking...but yes, some of us conduct our business from our holidays around the world :)  - Rooms: We were appointed rooms that felt more like chalets. Potentially, this could do more with our group package, which I doubt because other travellers in…"
915," My husband and I together with our friends was traveling this summer in Italy and decided to go to Cannes for few days to rest before coming back to work. We stayed at Le Grand Hotel and enjoyed every minute of our stay. Hotel located right on a beach on a Le Crossett blvd. It has parking and private beach, restaurants and bars. We loved it. And planning our next vacation which will include stay at Le Grand. Thank you Guys for your hospitality"
916,"Spacious, very well equipped apartment in cosy neighbourhood. Good restaurants, good shopping nearby. A short walk to City Center. Good service, ""gemutlichkeit""  from ""the drifters"" of the place. A little noice from the street in the night."
918,Stayed 3 nights in this wonderful Hotel. The rooms are spacious with kitchenet and very good mattresses. Located between the Sacrada Familia and Ocean site. Nice and quiet. Very friendly and helpful staff. Breakfast okay. I would recommend this hotel and for sure return.
919,"Stayed for 7 nights in an Executive Corner room, Terrace rooms were sadly fully booked. The room was much smaller than expected and was a little tired looking. The hotel is in need of a renovation. The wardrobe was tiny and we were provided with an extra rack for our clothes. The wardrobe would not serve one female let alone two. The bathroom was adequate, although the shower sqeaked and hissed and the shower door did not close. We alerted housekeeping and an engineer attended to fix both. The bed was very comfortable and we had views from 2 windows which gave a feeling of extra space. We had a number of issues on arrival and found a member of management fairly quickly who was responsive and tried to assist. We waited 10 minutes for a porter upon arrival at the hotel and had to…"
920,I stayed here for a week.  Surprised by some of terrible issues; as I had NO issues. The rooms are spacious and the staff all over is very courteous and speak good English and are more than eager to help!  Breakfast was also good. The colleagues at the hotel; Sara; Arthur; Aristide Farid among others made my stay great. For example I wanted to go to a supermarket which seemed far away.  Arthur helped me by finding a super market close to the hotel. Net net great experience so the 5 stars. For me location was not an issue as I had come to work; and this hotel was closest to my work.  Thanks again to all the staff!  Merci   V
921,"This was our fourth stay at this hotel/ sister hotel up the road. Thanks to all the friendly staff, particularly, Zeyi, who helped make our experience in Paris special. Paul, Marthese, Tania and Rachel. "
923,"Despite being the most convenient hotel to my needs, this is the third time I have stayed at the Double Tree and it will be my last.   I was willing in the past  to overlook some small problems in the past"
924,"My husband, young daughter and I stayed here at the beginning of the summer.  We arrived after midnight, and staff did the best they could to expedite our check-in.  Would have been nice to have been offered a drink (or milk for my daughter) at check-in. Have seen this at other Ritz properties.  Had breakfast from room service.  Ordered just the one entree, and there was enough food for all of us (I know there is some sticker shock on the menu cost, but this is a good alternative if you are having a slow morning).  Room was clean, comfortable, with great view and staff provided a nice travel cot for my daughter.  Would have liked a third set of towels.  Tried the pool one day, but it was a small area and was very very crowded.  Even the kid's pool had lots of adults in it, so we…"
925,change your bedding  get new pillows that was the gross part update your rooms  get a refrigerator in the room to make up for the crap of a room your people need to be trained on better customer service  if you ask for one  if a customer ask for something get it for them  tried of sorry it does not mean anything to a customer 
927,"Don't try to eat a pizza with your family at one of the 100+ empty tables in the lobby of this hotel.  Not only will they advise you this is against policy, they will also call security on you and your 4 young children before you've even had a chance to move.   If you want friendly, accommodating staff to take care of you and your family -- look elsewhere."
928,"Value the money and very good service, the location is super. staff is really friendly. the room is clean. you can go shopping nearby and it is easy to find sth. to eat. I recommend this hotel for your stay in Paris."
929,"This is a 1 Star, when I'm feeling generous. I've travelled all over India, Colombia, in hostels and hotels and Diva takes the cake for my worst experience ever. The room I reserved and pre-paid for mysteriously was no longer available. The elevators didn't work. My room keys never worked. The TV, remote, and dresser drawers were sticky and oily. After checking in, I found my bathroom sink was overflowing...even though I hadn't used it yet. Filthy water was coming UP FROM THE SINK DRAIN and spilling onto the floor...complete with other guests's hair and Satan-only-knows-what-else. Don't ever, ever come here. There are dozens of nicer, cleaner hotels for the same price, in the same area. This hotel is your worst nightmare. I promise."
930,"nice and comfortable ibis. Calm and clean, very friendly staff. The only drawback is that it is 10min walk away from Postdamerplatz (train or U-bahn stations). Probably not an issue for tourist visit, but might be for business if not nearby U-bahn station       "
931,"A very nice hotel with exceptionally friendly and serviceminded staff. I love that they have an environment-friendly awareness without reducing the comfort. My room was clean, delicate and neat. The breakfast was delicious, and the rooftop pool and bar was great. I had a very pleasant stay and can easily recommend this hotel for business travels to Barcelona."
932,"We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and were VERY surprised to discover that wifi was not included. The wifi was 2.50 euros for 1 hour or 9.99 euros for 24 hours. This was despite the fact that its listing on Expedia indicates they offer free wifi. So very strange.   The room itself was very nicely updated and I enjoyed the decor. The TV had very limited channels for an international audience. Most of the channels were in German only without subtitles and they only had two English-speaking channels: BBC and CNN. The location was decent - about 3 blocks from Check Point Charlie and very close to the Spittelmarkt U-bahn station. The bathroom toiletries smelled very nice, but the bottles are very small. There was a very helpful electric kettle in the room for tea and coffee and a…"
933,"I’m a Marriott Rewards member and this is the first and only time I’ve had to write a poor review for one of its properties.  The hotel itself is beautiful and modern - but when service is indifferent and lacking responsiveness, why bother bringing your business here - there are better options in Chicago.  First, their in-room room service is more similar to a casual takeout.  Second, I requested for a late checkout - how they responded was rather curt.  Third, I had to call them five times for a simple toothpaste to be delivered and had to wait for more than hour.  And when they finally delivered, not even a “hello” - and of course, no apology.    Bottom line, you’d get better service in a Residence Inn than this Marriott Marquis.  SKIP!"
934,"We had 2 nights in this hotel, it was clean, lovely decor, fabulous staff, delicious breakfast, and fantastic location. Would highly recommend. We got a great deal on Groupon UK so it was a lot cheaper than the standard rates (which are up there!) including breakfast so if you can find a deal, book this place! Best bathroom we have ever had in a hotel, the shower is superb. "
935,"The hotel felt overwhemed on our visit. As a platinum member we were had a nice quiet room with the exception of huge gouges in the wood floor and stains on the carpet. We pointed out the floor to the bell hop as the floor was splintered, he told us no problem it's alright. The next morning we went down to have breakfast and waited and waited to be seated, we finally left and went to another restaurant outside the hotel. We usually have late check out privilage with platinum status, we were given an extra 30 minutes as the hotel was too busy. We were also charged for a bottle of water which had a little sign, with our compliment for you plantinum status. This was not a pkantinum status visit for us."
936,Me and friends have been here for one week. We booked a four star hotel because we hoped to have a good hotel but instead we were looking forward to leave this hotel. First of all the room is too small. We had no place to move in the room. We had to keep our lagueges on the floor. They use to change the blankets and towels but I am sure they never cleaned the floor (moquette). The shower with a shower screen but too short so all the water use to go out of the shower and it was very dangerous that we could slip away. They didn't clean our room for more than one day. generally the room maintenance is very bad. The moquette in the dinner hall is so dirty... OMG... I cannot believe it. How is it possible in a four star hotel?  Anyway we are not at all happy of this hotel. I don't…
937,"Key cards failed constantly. Replaced 5 times during a 3 day stay. Replacement sometimes took up to 30 mins due to busy reception shared by 3 buildings. You have to pay to rent the safe daily. I left my wallet in the safe with a card and cash. The Hotel refused to mail/courier back to me even when I was happy to do so at my own cost. Very slow F&B poolside service. Reminding them at least 3 times in 2 hours. Orders delivered wrong and some billed to the wrong rooms. All guests passports for check in were left at reception in full view of anyone who passed by. No security or privacy towards passports and they could easily be stolen. Stunning location & views from pool area. Clean, quiet & large rooms, comfy bed. Building used to be a retirement home so some diasble access…"
938,"Location is very sketchy, there are drunk and drugged out people roaming the surrounds all day, especially at night so it restricts what you can do.  The hotel itself is creepy, dark and very worn.  The hot water for the shower didn't work, the air conditioner makes a ton of noise, the bathroom is tiny and coming apart and the WIFI was up and down.  Probably a cheaper option when compared with others, but I recommend that you say downtown where there are more people, activity and it's safer"
939,"An very nice hotel close to the center of the city. Only 2 minutes to the nearest bus and 10 minutes  walk into Kaufhaus des Westens. Nice and clean rooms, the restaurant has a good breakfast and the staff was very friendly"
940,"Close to leidsplein station. Which helps alot and you have easy access to everywhere. Bike rental is 3min walk. The staff are great, friendly and reliable. The hotel could be cleaner, it is kind of old! Needs a few renovations inside the rooms. The backyard is a large place and could be used in a far better way, things like coordinating some gatherings for guests so that they could know eachother and the city. Maybe an open door fireplace for cold seasons and evenings could help in the backyard."
941,"We stayed one night at the Sheraton Porto as a starting point for a hiking vacation. We arrive mid-day after an overnight flight and we were thrilled to have early access to our room. We were hungry yet the only option was a short sandwich menu at the bar.   We hopped on the Yellow Tourist Bus, a very short walk from the hotel and greatly enjoyed a tour of the city, on top of the double decker bus. We got off in the city centre to wander around and then hopped back onto the bus for an extended tour. The hotel’s proximity to downtown is very good.  Our room was fine, with a modern look, a pretty view and a very firm bed.   Our disappointment was with the hotel’s main restaurant where we decided to have dinner, as we were tired and did not want a late night. The concierge told us…"
942,"We stayed 6 days in Paris at the Vic Eiffel.  The front desk staff very friendly and helpful.  The hotel has a charming ambience.  The rooms are average in size for Paris but clean with comfortable beds with good air conditioning.  The location is excellent, on a main road, across the street from the Metro station.  Around the corner are restaurants, shops.  It is walking distance to the Rodin museum.  Wifi is excellent.  Included breakfast was delicious and had variety.  WE would definitely stay there again."
943,"We had a 2 night stay here in a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment. The 2 bathrooms were a godsend for 4 adults.  Our first night we attempted to do some washing in our sink and realised we a) had no hot water and b) had no pressure whatsoever. We rang reception who organised a plumber to come out, within in an hour water was restored, they never confirmed what the issue was but we suspect it was our whole floor experiencing an issue as we heard lots of phones ringing around us after we called reception.  Something we found hard was navigating through the miriad of doors to get to your room, from memory we were on the 5th floor and had to walk through about 3 or 4 doors to get into the correct hallway. It just felt like a Rabbit Warren. It just doesn't make any sense why so many…"
944,"Gorgeous, clean and very comfortable hotel rooms right in Alexanderplatz. Everything you would expect from this quality of hotel. Some noise if you are faced onto the main road, but not a deal breaker for us. We didn’t have breakfast included and went elsewhere as it was €17 each! Lots of attention to detail and very secure as you cannot use the lift without a room card. Online check in and check out great bonus too! The only thing we found is that the staff didn’t smile much or seemed overly friendly,  but we found this pretty much wherever we went in Berlin :-( - but it didn’t stop us! :-). Highly recommend!"
945,"just got back having spent a week allinclusive,we had two rooms 604 and 606 which was very good size and exellent views.A very welcoming and friendly staff that did everything to help you to which mangement should begrateful for,nice size pool and indoor pool and gym and teennis court also good measures on the drinks.However for the bad points food was at best awful entertainment rubbish and started to late also had to pay for pool 5 euros ,and the biggest complaint no air conditioning anywhere ridiculous hot also needs some updating the hotel broken windows,chips in walls and around the pool needs patchingup in a few places.If it were'nt for the staff i'd have given this hotel a two lastly that hill steep."
946,"So the views are spectacular... the pool is amazing... the rooms are nice... but to me, what makes a hotel ""a worlds leading hotel"" is the service, the staff... the intangibles. I won't go on and on... but from front desk staff, to most of the restaurant staff... everyone seems either rude or angry or phony. I would still stay here because it truly is beautiful and there aren't many hotels with pools in Porto... and while it is located off the beaten track, it was like a 5 euro Uber ride to get pretty much anywhere. Just watch your step getting out of the bathtub... it's a loooong drop! There were 3 exceptions to this overall feeling of misery... (unfortunately I can't recall their names) but a young gentleman who had recently transferred from another Pestana property truly went…"
947,Hotel itself is pleasant and clean but it is 3km from town. You can walk in 45 minutes but this is not ideal for evening dining. There are no decent restaurants within easy walk . The hotel restaurant serves good food BUT you must book win the morning to reserve a table for dinner. It is not cheap.There is a shuttle service into town at set times in the morning and from town in the evening and this must be prebooked. There are only 6 places on the mini bus. Breakfast was excellent and the restaurant staff were pleasant and helpful.
948,"I had the misfortune of staying here recently having missed a connecting flight. The only pro this hotel has going for it is the location. That's it. Check in was smooth, and the staff are friendly but the hotel itself is desperately outdated, and in need of a refurbishment. The room was clean, and despite the outdated decor I figured I'd at least get a good night's sleep before my morning flight - WRONG!   There is absolutely zero sound proofing  between rooms. There was a family staying in the room next to mine and I could hear everything. It's not that they were excessively loud but they might as well have been in the same room given I could hear everything. Babies crying, story time and kid's cartoons. In addition to the noise from next door, the heating (steam heating?)…"
949,"Had to spend my last week here after 4 in the Grand. Was given a apartment on the front corner,no sun,overlooking dustbin area. The reception gave us a heater which made room better. Main restaurant closed for holiday. Shall never return to this hotel."
950,We have been long time Turtle Bay guests. This November I took my wife on a 9 day trip to Turtle Bay as we love North Shore. There was a lot that went wrong this trip at Turtle Bay and we were wondering why. When we spoke to the manager they said the hotel had new owners.   Turtle Bay was awesome because it was not like the Waikiki hotels. Now they are trying to be. They want to charge for all the beach chairs with umbrellas which they never did except for the Gazebos. What was interesting was the beach was covered with people on towels as no one wanted to pay for the chairs. It looked odd.   Secondly we used to rent a gazebo a couple of times on our trips. This time we passed as they got rid of the nice gazebos with the beds and curtains. Now they have these plastic pole things…
951,"Stayed 3 nights. Reasonably clean room but really tiny space. But, really far from the happening part of Amsterdam city. Won't have minded a minimum of 20 Min walk to anywhere but with one week of 0-5 degree weather it's pure torture walking by the open dock with winds of 40mph. Stayed in room till 3pm on the last day due to this reason, and i had 3 persons knocking on my door (and even one opening my room before I can reach my door!!!!) despite the do-not-disturb sign. So much so for security.  Will not choose this hotel in future for sightseeing visit."
953,"We had several problems with the Tulip Inn, during our seven night stay on business, the most serious of which was no hot water for most of our stay. I was with three other colleagues, and all of us suffered from that problem. One of our party left early as a result.  In addition, I had cause to complain about an insect infestation in a colleague's room, two broken lights and a broken balcony door. The rooms clearly haven't been updated in some time - despite the attractive lobby. Even the toaster at breakfast is broken, and not fit for purpose, yet put out every morning as if there were no problem.  I did complain to the manager, and got an immediate excellent response - a plate of fruit in my room (too late on my last night to be any use to me, but a nice thought nonetheless).…"
954,"Quite affordable accommodation in the Champs- Élysées neighborhood! When we found it on internet, the place was exactly the same as described on the website. We were traveling six of us and got 2-bedroom residences. This hotel was perfect, it had a small kitchenette, spacious master bedroom with great window spot for pictures. Easy access to go there and they even offered transport to airport with best price! Friendly staff, we got code to enter the hotel, felt safer. My friends and I were so happy, very recommended if you want to stay in Champs- Élysées area. You can walk to see all the high-end cafes and resto."
955,"Hotel clean and in good location. Desk staff and management should be fired. Basic staff should be running the hotel. Restaurant is very good. The rooms are very clean and have everything you need. When going there rely on anything but the desk people, staff lower down will look after you"
956,"Problems: -Booked non smoking room, was given smoking room: told it was orbitz fault for offering non smoking when they only had smoking available. -Run down old looking, cigarette burns in curtains, hot water kept coming through when cold water was running- college burned herself brushing teeth. Maintenance came and looked, said they would leave a note, followed up with front desk and still wasn't fixed when we checked out at the end of the 4 days. -Room did not have accessible power outlets for laptops, phone chargers etc. We had to crawl under the bed to get to the one outlet (we later moved a dresser and found one behind it).  -They claim to have free internet but it does not work and when it does it is very slow. -Only one old slow moving elevator. The maids take it over in…"
957,"Galosol hotel has a great location right at the ocean. All options are there, diving school, gym, yoga (outstanding yoga). Rooms are clean and the staff is really friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, the food disappointed us. Breakfast has a huge buffet but more focused on quantity than quality. As a hotel offering so many outdoor and sport activities, I would love to have a variety of healthy food. They do have a healthy corner with some cereals but that's about it. Drinks and service at the hotel bar were disappointing except for beer and sangria. "
959,"After 20 years of business travel, I have never had a worse hotel experience.  Upon arrival, my reservation (with confirmation number) was no where to be found.  The 3 other members of my group who had reservations made at the same time were already checked in.  Although my reservation was lost, I was given a room.  I expressly told the front desk staff that I needed 2 nights, but after the first night, a bill showed up under my door.  I called the front desk and explained my story all over again and they indicated that  it would be no issue for me to stay a second night.  Apparently that was not the case. At 5:30pm I was contacted by the front desk and told that I had to leave.  When I packed up my belongings and went down to the front desk I asked to speak with the manager to…"
960,"SP Millennium Suites are dreadful. No room cleaning, no working wifi, no towel rail (broken), no coffee, no room service, no window covering, no immediate contact. Desk manned intermittently. Mouldy shower. Exorbitant price for what we got.   Good location but that's about it. "
961,"We stayed 2nights in. Junior suite room was lovely great view of the Zoo gardens. We eat in the restaurant food and service was outstanding. Staff were helpful and efficient, especially Mareke she was brilliant we had an issue and she sorted it. Breakfast was great and so much to choose from. Would definitely recommend this hotel."
962,"The hotel is conveniently situated close to the historical center and the airport. The staff is polite, efficient and helpful. Rooms are small but clean. Breakfast is served in a cozy area and the available selection is adequate. "
963,"Location was ok, nowhere right by this other than a grocery store. You have to walk at least 10 minutes to get anywhere you actually want to go. Staff is kind of rude and very unhelpful. Otherwise the hostel was clean and well organized with a cool common area. "
964,"We were holding 3 rooms for 4 nights (at full price) each at this hotel and unfortunately due to an emergency, had to cancel 1 of these rooms. In the process of trying to cancel, was always transferred to central reservations not located on property. They stated they couldn't cancel reservations from their end and I would need to speak directly with the in house team but their offices closed at 5:00pm. Central reservations ASSURED me that I would have no issues with the cancellation and there would be no penalties as they would note it in the reservation notes.  In FINALLY speaking with the hotel itself, I was told that 1 night cancellation would still apply even after mentioning all of the above and that there was nothing they could do about it. Spoke with the most useless…"
965,"Just came back from this hotel today, I'm going to put this review in order of pro's and con's so bare with me.  First pro the hotel is nice and quiet right by the beach, when me and my girlfriend got there, people didn't rush to get sun beds there was loads of space, as the week went on beds became less and less as you would expect. All of the staff are lovely and nothing is a problem for them, the pool is always kept clean, drinks are available soft drinks and alcoholic, if you go down the cocktail road then expect a shock alcohol to juice ratio. The rooms are always kept clean by the maids always came back to the room to find the room nice and tidy, the buffet is nice to an extent but ill explain the cons in that section.   Now the Cons, Back to the buffet, yes it is nice…"
966,"Stayed here with work for 4 days and provided right balance if work but he chance to relax with the spa, although the naked rules in the sauna and steam rooms proved a bit if a concern for some. Great pool and staff were very accommodating."
967,"Upon arrival they tried to give us an unsatisfactory room and I refused so they gave us a different room which was fine.  Large room, king size bed, great walk in shower.  The only criticism of the room was the the carpeting was badly stained.  We were happy with our visit."
968,"A friend sent me to the Chavanel, and Im so grateful. From the minute we walked in, the front desk staff were at-the-ready to make sure we had whatever we needed. It's really a tiny place, but for us that was the big plus ! Our room was absolutely wonderful with a great view of Rue Tronchet and it couldnt have been a better location for dining, shopping, or starting off on a day of sightseeing. Perfect."
969,"My family had 3 nights at this Accor Hotel. My room got nice garden view with nice yard. We booked the room which included breakfast. The food at exchange restaurant was good but the service was terrible. We were not offered coffee unless we called them several time. the staffs at restaurant were not attentive, they needed more training.   I would like to thank Ms Loan at front desk for her hospitality, she's very friendly. We met front desk manager ( a young man, named Huang maybe i spelt wrong). We complained about the service at restaurant and he was so nice to us by offering us discount on restaurant bill as hotel apology. Actually we really appreciated his offer, he's very attentive.  The check out process was quite long. It needs to be improved.   It's a nice resort but…"
970,I have stayed at Le Meridien in Shanghai off and on for 5 or 6 years - primarily as I believe it is best location in town to access subway if attending trade fairs in Pudong - but somehow this hotel just misses the mark and does not deliver the experience it should.  It is a very attractive hotel internally and as I said best location in Puxi in my opinion - but somehow the general feeling is always a cold reception from staff.  I booked to stay on Sat Dec 20 before returning to Melbourne - on arrival at hotel bell boys lifted my 2 large heavy bags from rear of car and I alighted with roller bag - bell boys then ask me do I need a hand with my luggage? Blind Freddy could see I could not carry all 3 bags.  I am SPG Gold - being Dec 20 I know hotel is going to be very low…
971,"We have been long time regulars of Cascade since it opened. We spend 14 - 15 weeks each year in Lagos. We have stayed in the hotel and in the apartments. We have dined in the restaurant and have had many wonderful evenings in the bar with friends.  We visited there the other evening. Everything has changed. The lovely restaurant is now a glorified overpriced snack bar and the beautiful velvet clad furniture in a bar with great mood lighting and such a wonderful intimate atmosphere has been replaced with cream faux leather, cream curtains and bright lights. 5 star is now very much just 3 star. So very sad!! Incidentally prices have not been reduced to fleet this new reality. Please bring back the original designer or at least someone who understands the 5 star concept."
972,We stayed for 2 nights - great rooms superb service and top quality food. We were blown away by the breakfast buffets every morning. This was probably the biggest breakfast selection and highest quality we have ever experienced on our trips around the world - just outstanding throughout. The service was excellent and very professional. We are back in a few days❤️!
973,"My family books hotels in various destination from time to time and this has been the most unsatisfactory stay for my family. Not only where the rooms extremely small also the parking and wifi were not included, despite paying $700 for our stay we were being charged another $300 for parking and wifi, it felt like a loot. i will not recommend this hotel to anyone."
975,My wife and I spent 3 nights here and loved it.  David and Gregory at concierge desk were great. Biking to Antibes on the hotels ebikes was a great experience. Buffet breakfast was very good.  Very reasonably priced in October.  Walking distance to train station and a lot of restaurants.  View from room was amazing.  Hope to return.  Glad we chose Cannes over Nice.
977,"I've been to nicer hostels, with better amenities, and reading other reviews I would advise people to take care with their valuables and use the lockers provided. That being said, my girlfriend and I had a really nice time there. We found the staff very kind and friendly, and they went out of their way to look after us and make us feel at home. It was really great to have such helpful people on 24-hour reception, with few enough staff that we got to know them all. I hope that everyone who visits is nice and polite to them; asking the receptionist how their shift is going will always work out well for you!"
978,Basic yet comfortable accommodation. The room was clean and the bed was cozy. Elevators were fast and not busy. There were only body wash and no shampoo or conditioner. Not enough power outlets. Overall impression was very good. 
979,"- Swimmingpool very dirty!! Even in the morning (?). Wrong addition also from the bar, two times!  Didn’t clean on the floor in our room for 4 days.  Some people in the reception were not very service minded...  +Otherwise the roofpool nice situated! The spa very nice.  The hôtel a little far away from the center (for us) "
980,"Not up to the normal Hilton standards. Hotel staff was great, Coffee shop staff was awesome. restaurant front staff unengaged. too expensive not helpful. Beds terrible, HVAC terrible. Porch was a great touch to enjoy the view and sun."
981,"I stayed here and new to Berlin, the staff helped me with anything and everything. You are close to loads of food places, also supermarkets if you want to find your own drinks etc. They get very expensive to buy in the city. I walked a couple of times to all the sights. But there is an underground close by also. Which is very convenient and cheap. The rooms are clean and perfect for people heading out for an adventure."
982,"The hotel is easy to reach from and to the airport using the Red metro line. Since there is a steep walk from Alameda to the hotel, we usually take the Oliias station (10 mins walk) coming from the center, and Alameda station going to the city center. So it is not very convenient if you want to go back to the hotel again for an afternoon nap ... which was in our case last October, Lissabon is crowded with tourist and under 30 deg sun was a bit exhausting...  The AC was not turned on during the warm humid weather last October ... so it was hot a bit warm in the night.   The rooms are great and the breakfast is very good! Except for the one question, one answer type of receptionist on our first day... It was over-all a good experience!"
983,"The stuff was uninterested when we entered for the check-in. They left us waiting with not even welcome us. The room was small and there were only one extra pillow. There is a A/C working unstoppable and the temperature was always low.  The worst thing was that there was not any hotel supplies such us a shower cap or some body lotion because of an eco friendly policy! The breakfast was ok and satisfying.  They offer two bottles of water for free. The parking is for 20 euros per day. The distance is almost 5,5 k from the centre. Need to take the car and pay 60-70 euros for central parking. Choose the tram."
984,"excellent location from the metro and also T1 and they lay on a small (8 peeps max) transfer to the airport FOC,  Only there for a quick night b4 early am flight but it was nice and modern,  Nice they give to breakfast box if you leave early but to be honest it was pretty poor and wouldn't really bother,  Our room however did have a weird sliding door to the bathroom which cam off the runners at 2am which was not fun and a little dangerous, lucky it was on the way out of the bathroom,  Overall a fine choice for airport hotel."
985,"The Meliá Hotel is located at a very central point. You can either come with public transport or walk from Berlin hbf. Breakfast is probaly fine, but we ate at diffrent spots near the hotel and did daily groceries."
986,"If you are a Hilton regular, this one will definitely disappoint. Poor service, miserable staff and none of the usual Hilton perks. Find another Hilton, although the  one on O'Farrel is just as bad, so maybe go for a Marriot!!"
987,"As much as we were told how beautiful this hotel was it was not. Upon arriving it looks very grand. However to check in we had to travel up to another floor which was ok I suppose. Each time we entered the hotel it smelt old and musty. Our room was on the 9th floor. There are four lifts that service the rooms but are rather hopeless as you cannot tell which lift is arriving as the numbers are recessed so you cannot see them. On arrival to our floor we stepped out into what felt like an 'abyss' a HUGE space. Walking down a dark corridor to our room flanked by old dark ancient side boards we came to our door, again an old dark wooden door. The room was spacious however again the furniture was old, dark wood and chipped. The compendium and directory which were housed in a dark…"
988,"Well-located around 10 minutes walk from the main train station and 15 minutes to the main action, you won't really need to use public transport or taxis. The staff were really helpful and welcoming. The room was small but clean and with decent tea-coffee facilities. At a 75 euro price-tag, it's a reasonable city-centre option and I'd certainly stay here again."
990,"On the plus side: I really loved the rooms, spacious and stylish. Very clean. The  bed was super comfortable, the sofa bed was good for being a sofa bed. We made most our food in the room and the kitchen was functional. In earlier reviews people was complaining about kitchens supplies but the have water boiler, toaster, tea and coffee, cutting board, wooden spoon, kitchen wear for 4. The hotel offers free well equipped gym and free washing room. I didn't used it but it looked good.   Room for improvement: Even if we touched the A.C it was set on 25 every day we came home....  Our room smelled of food. With a close inspection the kitchen fan filter was broken and filthy. This was fixed after two visit to the front desk. The smell improved after that. We stayed in room 606. That…"
991,"Great and convenient location to downtown Berlin. Loved the Hackersher markt area. So close to Museum Island, local shops and restaurants (reasonable price) and near Alexandraplatz (shopping and transport hub) but not too close. We walked up easily to the Brandenburger gate in about 30 minutes. The apartment was very comfortable and clean. Well designed rooms and friendly staff. It is right near the railway and tram but we found the hotel very quiet for such an inner city location. Two supermarkets are steps away, one is organic food. Staff were helpful and friendly. Hotel is owned by Australians so welcoming and well tuned to travelers needs. Great for families, singles or couples. We loved Berlin with all its beautiful architecture, complex history and green /healthy vibe plus…"
992,"The hotel is lovely inside and out. My family and I had a good time during our 5 days in Amsterdam. Free ferry to reach to hotel but beware the ferry service wont start till 930am in the weekend which was a bit nightmare to us for catching our flight early .   Staff was very helpful and attentive. However, staff needed to explain more clearly about charging us €250 for our 2 rooms when we checked in to hotel. There WAS NO explanation why and if the money was going to refund to us when we checked out from the hotel.  When we were checking out from the hotel, a male staff dealth with us, he wasnt very patient and I only asked him when I am going to get my €250 back, he attitude wasnt the best and he was talking to other member of staff about I kept chasing about my money back and…"
993,"Nice hotel, very clean if out dated a little, spa treatments were amazing! Local to the centre and some lovely bars and restaurants nearby. Request a room at the front! This hotel is the noisiest I’ve ever stayed in! Behind is a warehouse type building and the bands practising or playing are great early evening but at 330am it gets a bit much, then there’s the vans slamming the doors when loading their instruments until 530am. Wasn’t just one night but Every night. Oh and it’s just started to rain so the debris in the back wil echo again! So I type this on my last night listening to the drums and the base, day dreaming of my own home and peace and quiet!"
994,It's location is great to explore de city. It's close to a busy area but located in a quiet street.  The staff was fantastic during my stay.  My main complaint was my room. My bed had a strange smell which felt like someone else's sweat. I don't believe it's the same in other rooms as my colleague didn't have that in his room.   Also not the most comfortable bedroom for a business traveller. If you want to work at a desk for some hours you'll probably get back pain after a while.   Restaurant was great but a bit pricey.   Overall I enjoyed my stay apart from the issue mentioned. 
995,"I stayed at Montaigne during the Mipim event.Sİnce I spend most of my day time in the event ;my requirements are ,walking distance to Palais , decent size clean room,silence,free wifi and good price.For all the above , montaigne performed well and nearly half price compared to other mid-scale hotels.Next year planning to stay again,recommended"
997,"Great location, great staff, excellent breakfast! The spa was very pleasant as well. We really enjoyed our stay and definitely recommend this hotel. Rooms could be a bit bigger, but this is quite common in Paris."
998,"Hotel Diva tries to position itself as trendy and chic.  In reality, it is way over-priced and of very poor quality: small, very noisy rooms; cheap, broken furniture; terrible TV reception; erratic water temperature in the shower.  Only positives were good check in and check out.  I stayed in room 620, facing Geary Street, on 6th of 7 floors. The traffic noise was absolutely horrendous and deafening. Also, there was a door to an adjoining room that looked of normal thickness but must be hollow as I could hear every word that the people in the next room said or watched on TV.  Also, whenever the HVAC unit came on I had to adjust the TV volume, probably more due to the smallness of the room than anything else. I knew I was in trouble when I saw that the hotel provides you with ear…"
999,"We stayed here Sept 2018 for 2 nights.  The location is great, maybe a 15-20min walk to the Eiffel Tower (and lots of restaurants along the way).  We had a room on the 5th floor and a view of the Eiffel Tower!  The room was small but recently renovated so it was very comfortable and modern.  The bathroom was small also but very clean.  It had a sliding door and faced the bed though which was a little awkward.  The front desk staff were friendly enough.  Breakfast was not included but we did stay there one morning for it ($10 Euro) and it was good, lots of typical European options, cheeses, meats, baked goods, fruits, eggs etc.  Even though we were on a main street it was surprisingly quiet.  I would definitely stay at the First Hotel again."
1000,"We're opposite the staff lift and have finally tracked down the phone that rings constantly to the inside of this lift.  It woke me three times in the night and the constant ringing this morning was worse than being at work.  When raised with reception they of course tried to palm us off with an upgrade, which I refused as we're only here for one more night.  So we were instead offered water or soft drinks FOC in the upstairs bar.  The receptionist understood that I wasn't impressed with this offer. I know I'm never going to get a discount but the accepted compromise, of cocktails FOC, didn't really cut it either considering we're here to sleep / relax.    There are other niggles too, also not befitting the 5* status, including air con very inefficient in our room compared to…"
1001,I'm not sure why on earth people are giving this a positive rating and I'm shocked it's rated 4.5 stars. There are much nicer and accommodating hotels for the same price in SF that I've stayed at. The rooms are small. The lobby smells. I had a broken and leaking coffee machine in my room which over time leaked water all over my floor. Their solution was that they could charge me to pay for a coffee through room service. Do not ruin your SF trip or waste your money by staying here. Go somewhere else. The location isn't really that great and there are no views from the room.
1002,"If you're looking for a nice family apartment in Exaimple, Splendom Suites is really nice. There is lovely decoration, modern kitchen, every day cleaning service, etc. In the neighbourhood nice cafes like Cup & Cake, Cake & Brunch, eco grocery store, cheese shop, butcher's, Italian restaurant, sushi bar, etc. And the best, you can easily walk to the downtown, less than 1kms to Plaza Catalunya."
1003,The common area is fabulous! If that's what you're looking for. For the pricing of this place I would go with an Airbnb for future purposes. I had to ask the room be cleaned on a daily basis (and would get push back from staff). On one occasion staff asked me to clean the belongings that were left behind. Going into the city meant waiting 10-15 minutes for the ferry to load everyone on and take off. Anyone could walk into the hostel before 10 p.m.
1004,"I stayed at the Thuy Thuy resort this summer with friends while travelling to Mui ne we spent one night in a bungalow. The rooms were nice and so was the pool. However, following a misunderstanding about the checkout time. When we arrived to check out they proceeded to try and charge us half the price of a nights stay each. Even though we checked out at the time they said. In part this was due to the language barrier and was a simple misunderstanding. However, at no point did they come to remind us that we needed to check out. While trying to come to an agreement a woman comes over and starts screaming at us and starts having a tantrum and throwing glasses, we got our passports and left as quick as we could. Other than that i would actually recommend the stay the rooms were nice…"
1006,"Way too much money for this dated poorly maintained facility.  The carpet was dirty.  The tub wouldn't drain, worst thing ever is taking a shower standing in water! The stale grease odor in the restaurant says the grease interceptor and drains are not being serviced to control odors.  Location is the only thing this property has to offer."
1007,We stayed at The Opera Marigny from July 13th -17th and we couldn’t have asked for a better Hotel. The location is great and in a fun neighborhood plus you are within a 2 mile walking distance to most major sites. The Saint Lazare metro station is just a couple blocks away as well for when you don’t feel like walking.  The service was also exceptional. Everyone was very kind and helpful and always had a corkscrew when needed :) They also helped me book taxi reservations to and from the hotel from the airport prior to my visit.   We booked the junior suite for us and our 2 kids and the room was very nice. There was a living room that in our case had a couch and a rollaway in it. Really the room is more suited for 3 people but 4 can still fit. You do lose the sitting area but to…
1009,"The hotel was near the center of the city, clean and staff was very helpful. Good breakfast, although the same few days in a row. Would come back anytime!"
1010,"excellent location, 2 minutes from the metro station. our room was small but larger rooms are avalable. very cosy and warm with good breakfast. very pleasant staff always eager to assist. they gave us excellent advice on where to go for dinner."
1011,"The location of this hostel is very convenient; it's close to the Time Out Market and other main attractions and metro/bus stations. The bathrooms and rooms were clean and well maintained. There are lockers assigned for each bed inside the room, and the bathrooms have several shower stalls and toilets. The hostel seemed to be very involved with making guests acquainted with the city - they had daily tours, pub crawls, nightly sangria parties at the hostel, etc.   My only complaint is the level of noise - the rooms have very thin walls. I had several loud neighbors that were partying, fighting, and generally being disrespectful of the space. I know this isn't really the fault of the hostel, but it was part of the experience."
1012,Booked 14 nights worth of rooms and paid in advance only to find that they then billed the room again to my credit card without authorisation after my stay. No response to email asking for refund and now having to spend time chasing the money.
1013,"The hotel is amazing: small bungalows and hotel rooms which are clean, the water is hot, the beach is free and nice and the restaurant downstairs serves coconuts. But man, those machines a few meters from the hotel doing construction from 7.30 am to 10 every day even on Sundays just drove me to the borders of sanity. This means you don't get an hour for yourself to sleep or write emails or whatever in that timeframe without a very loud sound going non-stop. And when I was there they were just breaking the stones. Imagine how long it will take to build that hotel next door, at least a year or maybe two. And the noise is absolutely everywhere, no room is safe."
1015,"Friendly, safe, clean and cheerful. We didn’t stay for breakfast but had a lovely 3 night stay. We had clean towels and a cleaning service daily, the reception was always manned by friendly staff and the room was decorated in a lovely style with great black out curtains. "
1016,"We stayed here for 4 nights during our 7 night stay in Sao Paulo. We hedged our stay in SP by booking 2 hostels and I am glad we did because 3dogs did not turn out so great.  First for the pros: - Centrally located, 5 minutes walk to Ana Rosa station and the neighborhood is safe and convenient. - Breakfast is surprisingly good with plenty of ham and cheese on bread, and fruits. - Wifi signal is strong throughout the property and you will have a good signal in any of the rooms you stay.  Now the cons: - The staff are not very friendly. They will not really help you get acquainted with the surrounding neighborhood or the city of Sao Paulo. They were not even there when we got to the hostel at 7pm and we could not check-in for a full hour. - The double room we stayed in was dirty…"
1017,"We stayed 2 nights having chosen this hotel because I am an Accor member and with a then available special deal, together with another deal available through my credit card, I was able to get a very competitive price that on the face of it meant I was doing very well, getting a good located hotel with reasonably good reviews that had kitchen facilities for not a lot of money.  Ultimately the best thing about the stay was that I did not pay a lot.  The hotel's location is okay. While it is convenient to a lot of what Melbourne has to offer, the area immediately surrounding the hotel feels edgy and run down. That feeling was not helped by finding graffiti scrawled on the door and in the stairwell near our room that we'd considered using to go the one flight of stairs down to the…"
1018,"I have stayed here a few times for business trip as it's arranged through the company. The same experience prevailed: the customer service was shockingly bad! You name it: no eye contact - check. No smile - check. Passed you around instead of helping you to get proper help - check. Miscommunication over hotel charge & insisted that the guest was wrong - check. Serving while having bad cold & sneezing in front of guest without a mask - check. I even made a bet with a colleague that during our 2 weeks stay, I would never received a single courtesy smile or gesture and I won!  You can made a video of what-not-to-do in hospitality industry from the hotel staff here.  I gave 2 stars rating because the room was good and clean. Otherwise it's a 1 star rating definitely. "
1019,Good clean hotel within walking distance to the city centre / Leidseplein and a nice variety of restaurants nearby. Basic amenities at the hotel such as food and drinks / the minibar we found to be very expensive and therefore chose not to eat or drink at the hotel.
1020,"Great facilities, poor location. Facilities in this small boutyke “hotel” (maybe 12 rooms) were all renovated very recently and very clean. Staff is most helpful. Problem is location at night is kind of scary, especially if you are looking for food your first night there is not a good idea.  	Otherwise a great place to stay if you turn in before it gets dark."
1021,"Very good hotel, centrally located. Very good breakfast. Friendly staff. No wifi included in the room price. Must now pay 5 Euro for 24 hours. Got an upgraded room, a suite on the 1o th floor, with a good view over the city."
1023,"We arrived during a staff strike. So badly  handled by Marriott.  Carried our own heavy luggage to ou room and found a note informing there would be no bar no restaurant  no room service no cleaning in fact no services we were just paying full price for a room and basic breakfast. All of this would have been acceptable in the circumstances had there been a hint of how we would be compensated.  Such bad customer relations left a bad taste and we will never use a Marriott  group again. They have since refunded 1 nights stay , little to late. If this is how they treat their customers it is no wonder the staff are striking, good luck to them"
1024,"I really had not paid attention to the pictures when I booked the hotel, mostly chose it for the location and price. I was very pleasantly surprised. This is a charming boutique hotel and the staff makes you feel at home as soon as you walk in. The staff speaks both English and Spanish other than the normal French and is happy to help you bring your luggage up since there is no lift and help you with reservations, directions and flight confirmations. The rooms are very clean and cute (small by American standards, but you gotta remember where you are). The bathrooms didn't disappoint either with a very modern and clean look. The 3rd floor has a terrace that is wonderful to relax in after all the walking you do in Paris. For the forgetful ones like me that don't bring an adaptor…"
1025,"The place is probably the most badly decorated resort I have seen, with too many unnecessary details (like sofas next to an elevator...) and illogical orientation of public areas. Meanwhile, service is horrendously slow (took us 20+ minutes to wait for resort tuk tuk from pool to the beach, and check out procedure takes ages to be completed). It gets 2 stars and not 1 only because you don't really have many other options in Mui Ne. Still, if the place is not up-to-standard, it shouldn't claim to be a 5-star resort."
1026,"Our stay at the Congress Hotel was our first and last.  From the unattentive and unprofessional front desk, to the rude valets, to the very aged interior and appointments, and the inoperable elevators, this hotel should be demolished and its staff reassigned to businesses best fitting their lack-luster talents.  The housekeeping services were spotty at best, and when they did service the room, they missed many tasks expected of their jobs.  The hallways remind me of the hallways in the hotel used in American Horror Stories, Hotel series.  Never again."
1027,"Super hotel, great rooms, good locations, lovely bar and good food in the restauarant. Fantastic breakfast and really helpful staff. We really enjoyed our stay and it was a great base for visiting the Eiffel Tower (30 min walk) and the Seine, Versailles, the Louvre etc. It's only a 3-5 min walk from the main train station and nearest metro."
1028,"$350 average per night doesn't get you much at this hotel.  We had a view of the swimming pool, spa, and lucky us, a wedding that the hotel booked.  Unfortunately we paid for an ocean view room but all we got was loud D.J. music, dancing and partying until around 11:00 p.m. and a ton of kids playing in the pool.  Why does this hotel (or any hotel) have to block the guests' view to make money off of booking a wedding?  I didn't know these people, why would I want my view blocked to watch them party?  It took 1 day to set up for the wedding, 1 day to clean up from it.  There goes my weekend stay.  The room itself was just fair, looking tired.  The floor was so dirty that if you walked across with bare feet, they were black - not just dirty - actually black.  For what you get - Sea…"
1029,"I was excited to stay at this hotel as my parents had stayed here a few years a go and liked it. Clearly it has seen better days. The carpet in the hallway was stained and dirty and there was hair from the previous guest in the shower and sink. Breakfast was very average and the pool area was unkept. Front desk staff was generally unhelpful and would provide only generic recommendations (""go around the corner, there are lots of restaurants there."").   We had planned to stay 2 nights and checked out after 1 night after a terrible night of sleep on rock-hard pillows (I like a firm pillow but these were unreal - we had to use the pillows out of some decorative shams!).  We couldn't wait to be out of there. Price is exorbitant for the condition of the hotel - do yourself a favor and…"
1030,"The resort looks very nice and has a really nice infinity pool. Good breakfast.  However, please be aware that:  - The internet is barely usable. The Wifi access point is way too far from the room, resulting in very slow internet with constant package loss.  - You are about ONE HOUR drive from Mui Ne. There's a shuttle to some area of Phan Thiet (still 30 min away from Mui Ne) but you must leave early. If you don't catch the shuttle you're completely isolated, reliant on the resorts restaurant. Which is overpriced, has small portions and food is just average. Taxis cost $15-20 per direction!  - Staff is barely trained. We were awoken the first the day from the housekeeping suddenly being in our room. They only knocked once and immediately opened the door, even though we yelled…"
1031,"The location is nice in front of the beach and the personnel in reception was friendly and helpful. All the rest was pretty bad: very poor noise isolation, so you could hear all asians group everytime they enter or leave the room. Breakfast was not replenished, so if you came in the last hour there were few things left.  In general the room felt cheap, and the bed not very comfortable."
1032,"The term great value sometimes infers a compromise of some sort. And while the Passy Eiffel Hotel certainly is reasonably priced for a Parisienne hotel, I didn't feel any sense of compromise during my stay. The hotel has a great location, 5 min from the #6 Metro line, the rooms are extremely clean and well appointed, and the staff I encountered were as accommodating and helpful (extra special thanks and kudos to Christine) as one would expect from a five star house. At the end of the day, I left Passy Eiffel feeling both well cared for and well rested. Thank you Passy Eiffel. Highly recommended."
1033,"We were among the first guests to stay in the recently renovated hotel and the experience felt like a holiday in itself. The rooms seem unique and have amazing touches which make you feel more like are staying with your trendy friends than in a hotel. The bed was super comfortable and the shower was great (I read another review comment on the water pressure but it was fine during our stay).  I was expecting it to be quite noisy at night given our room was facing the station over the road, but the windows were good and it was actually very quiet.  We didn't eat in the restaurant for dinner, but the cocktails in the bar were fantastic. Breakfast was very nice too - not a spread with hundreds of items, but more focused with a really good quality, fresh range of hot and cold items.…"
1034,"We enjoyed our stay at the Augustinenhof. Our room was spacious and quiet, and the bed was wide and very comfortable. The hotel is just around the corner from the Oranienburger Strasse S-Bahn station, and is also within walking distance from Hackescher Markt and the Museum Islands. There are several cafés, eateries and art galleries in the immediate vicinity, so you don't need to have breakfast at the hotel (which at 12 EUR is rather expensive). My only criticism would be that we were woken up by the housekeeping staff going about their business at 8AM each morning."
1036,"Positives: Great location across from park. East facing rooms look onto lake. Spacious room with comfortable beds.  Negative: Disappointed in the way Hilton managed services during the workers strike. 1) I was paying $454/night for a standard room. There was no room service, the main restaurant was closed, and extremely limited to no housekeeping.  2) when I arrived at 9 pm  the room I had remotely checked into 12 hours earlier was not ready. They moved to another room, which was occupied  I was then upgraded for my troubles and the room was filthy. Unflushed toilet, dirty counters and layer do dust on closet doors.  I called and was told someone would clean the room. Day 3; no one had bothered to enter my room. 3) No apology letters from hotel management apologizing for the…"
1037,"They Change Swimming Pool hours time just because of the events. so no body from attending can swim ...VERY VERY disappointed .... like the attending are second class  VERY BAD , racist ... VERY Unprofessional"
1038,First off you pay over a hundred for this room and you don't even get a continental breakfast. Second...no hot water....no fixes either until I was checking out...Also crappy tv with a remote that didn't work and I was told no other rooms were available ....the fix it man came it and couldn't figure out how to reset the tv. Took him 20 minutes to get it to work.  20 minutes after he left it went out again. I wouldn't send a stray dog to this place. Also they brag about how nice their upgrades are...well the new beds are horrid. the tubs are nice and deep if you want to go swimming in ice water...the flat screens are from the early days of flat screens. Oh yeah and one last thing... the wi-fi keeps dropping you.  
1040,"It wasn't best choice for our stay in Riga.  Hostel is located on the end of dark street, 15minutes from city center. The whole building is rather old and smells bad :/   Room, blankets and bathrooms  weren't clean.  And the host... Men whom we met there barely speaks english and was kind of meddlesome. We've also got problems with parking out car.  I would recommend that place only if you haven't any other option."
1041,"Very nice rooms, luckily with no sounds from the street, modern decorated. The staff is discreet and helpful, even though I only had a problem at arrival. Also very close to Ku’dam, so in a very good spot for strolling around. Recommend it!"
1042,"We stayed one night during the very hot high occupancy holiday season. We got in very early (2am) but there is someone at the desk all night. Decent security in place with card in/card out.  Please note- if you check in after midnight they cannot accept payment and will hold your passports until the morning, which we were unhappy about but did anyway.  We arrived to a lively bar scene with a very friendly bartender who even stayed open longer than usual as we were enjoying ourselves as long as possible before going upstairs to the Dutch oven (our room which we shared with another couple and two singles). There is a decent sized smoke room and the downstairs area is air conditioned.  It was UnBearably hot in the room and there were not any fans available.  If it had been cooler…"
1043,"Had a fab holiday in Cannes made so much better by the welcoming staff in the Eden Hotel. Hotel is very central, close to the beach and the staff couldn't do enough to ensure we had a fabulous stay. Would definitely return to Cannes and to the Eden."
1044,"This is a hotel with great potential in a perfect position near the river.  Room 315 was immaculately clean and modern but very small. The wifi didn't really reach to the bed and it was better to stand using it outside the bathroom. Not ideal.  There are a number of lifts taking you to bedrooms but there is no sign telling you which rooms are served by which lifts. So it's easy to take the wrong one, and I did.   Breakfast is served in floor -3. When you exit the lift at that level, you might be forgiven in thinking you have strayed into the staff quarters - it's completely soulless - but persevere and you finally get the the breakfast room.  I checked in at 11pm and there were 2 staff on duty and I was served immediately by a very friendly member of the team. I checked out at…"
1045,"I could write my name in the dust covering the hangers, fixtures in the room, and towel rack.  The door to the bathroom was covered with fingerprints and soap splash from many occupants before.  I called down for an extra blanket and was given a smelly, dusty corduroy throw or something.  After my first night, I woke up sneezy and water eyed from al the dust.  I called down and told them I would like someone to properly clean my room.  They apologized and assured me they would. When I arrived that night, nothing had changed, AND there were bits of debris in both my shower and sink.  This time, I asked the housekeeping supervisor to come up and see my room and she agreed it was not properly cleaned.  My mirror hadn't even been cleaned.  Finally, this was all addressed. But then I…"
1046,"For me this is one of those hotels that was neither outstandingly good or bad. The room looked nice, with nice furniture and it was kept clean. The windows are fairly small which made the room hot (a good fan was supplied). The mattress needs to be replaced now, it's well past it's sell by date. There was one pillow and it wasn't comfortable, fortunately, I had brought my own. The bathroom could also do with a makeover but the shower was good. I usually stay at another 2 star hotel which is nicer and cheaper and not so far to walk from the center or a 4* hotel right in the center but both of these were fully booked. I would only return if the other options were limited as this is a 1 * hotel charging 2* prices."
1047,"Do not be fooled by the photographs of reception which is modern - the public ares seen to be the only areas that are - the staff are great no complaints at all. The souless bar in reception did have an excellent singer in the evening.   We are walkers BUT the hotel is 25mins walk from ther main attractions of Porto - in a dingy neglected area - reception suggested use of Metro ! The rooms are dark, dull, dated and cold not somewhere to linger. The bathroom was in need of a deep clean - the rims of basin and bath overflow thick with mould.  The restaurant was hectic at breakfast but there was a good selection on the buffet also tried restaurant in evening as nothing very local to hotel - vast area just five other tables in use once again souless.  Also tried the spa - which was…"
1048,"My boyfriend and I have just returned from the Grand Hotel Dore in Paris.  The location of the hotel is ideal as it is directly in front of you as you leave the metro, so great if you are unsure of the area.  A beautiful area, full of charm.  All of the hotel staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was plentiful each morning.  The rooms were small (as is the traditional lift - room for 2 at a squeeze, but that didn't put us off) but clean and of good quality.  Clean bathroom too, with good decor and power shower.   We would definitely stay at the Grand Dore again.  Bakers, restaurant, bar, metro etc, all within minutes walk."
1049,"We booked this hotel for 3 nights after reading all the rave reviews and were a bit disappointed. The first night we had to phone the front desk as I could not sleep on the mattress; it was covered in hard little wool knots. While they were quick to respond (by turning the mattress over to the much smoother side), could not understand why the mattress had passed inspection in the first place. To make up for inconvenience, we were given a coupon for a free drink and went to what we thought was the only bar, only to find out there are 2 bars. The gentleman in the bar downstairs was quite rude to us and sent us upstairs to the lounge bar, where the choice of drinks that the coupon entitled us to was quite limited. On the plus side, the room is quite roomy and modern but question…"
1050,"This hotel could be fabulous, it has everything by way of decor and nice addons. It is in a superb location and we could walk to everything. Bed is comfortable, the shower is good and the breakfast next door at ihop was convenient.   Watch out though. The hotel seems to have some scam going on with incidental charges of $75usd *per day* being charged to my card. I gave my cards as guarantee, but was never told an amount would go through or that this would be charged PER DAY.   Hard to appreciate why a hotel with free internet, no restaurant or mini bar, no purchasable extras in the room / services would need to do this.  Staff are numb to any complaints or suggestions. Poor management stems from the top."
1051,"Best thing about this hotel are most of their staff especially Jauo at the Splash Bar,  the lovely pool boy,  sorry didn't get his name, Jose at the Captain's Cabin bar & Splash Bar and Fernando (who is leaving for Madrid)  at the First floor bar. The housekeeping staff kept the bedroom & general areas spotless.  We were all inclusive , and as expected, the food was very repeative but plenty of it & always fresh.  As a vegetarian it was pretty poor,  salad but a lot of the salad dishes were full of meat or fish?!  The only other dish was always pasta.  Why not a veg curry,  vegetable stir-fry,  etc?  A lot of the soups were veggie not sure of the stock though.  They did make me an omelette several times but there are only so many you can eat.  The 'junior suite' was so outdated…"
1052,"I stayed here in the summer of 2011 after having stayed at various places on and along Michigan Ave. I ended up here with the three kids because it was a last minute trip and other places were booked. The front desk staff was very rude in accommodating me with rooms for us since I was solo with the kids. It wasn't that they couldn't put us in a connecting room (I understand that it wasn't guaranteed) but the manner in which he treated me. Very quick, rude as if I was interrupting. The lobby is updated and nice enough but as soon as you go up in those tiny elevators you realize you are in a very old, old building. The hallways were harrow old and somewhat creepy, even my daughter said so. The rooms were TIRED and SMALL! The bathroom was much a like a roadside motel. I could go on…"
1053,"Great location right opposite the main train station, easy access to major modes of transportation. Modern hotel and helpful staff. The complimentary waffle sticks were a pleasant surprise. The hotel was also not far from the Brandenburg Gate and Holocaust Memorial. Would recommend this hotel highly. "
1054,"Stayed her for work, you can’t work late at night for someone complaining that you are up working. Strong handed by the staff for being awake. The rooms are very basic and you can’t work late. Plus there is not a real restaurant. It’s a bad hotel. Negative vibe. Don’t book"
1056,"I have chosen this hotel as it was not far from the place that I had to go every day. The hotel was not so good comparing to the others within the same price range. There was nothing to eat in the evening, so I definitely do not recommend for a business trip. The rest was ok I can say."
1057,"Great location, very clean room, super comfy bed, and beautiful view of the city - BUT the heating & A/C unit was so loud the TV vibrated on the wall. This proceeded on and off all night. When I informed the front desk at check out, they said they would look into it. No apologies or offers to make things right. Very disappointing experience!"
1058,I stayed with a friend on our holiday in spain. It is just outside the train station and easy access to Barcelona as its easy to get to via a train journey.  The apartment was very clean and had all needed facilities.  We had the 7th floor which was a great view of the city.  Would definitely recommend it. 
1060,"At first, it was to enjoy the food. Then once I realised that I will be transported by the tasting menu to another level that I decided to stay in not to carry my tummy. Best decision that I did for my BCN days!"
1061,"From the outside it looks amazing! The chandeliers are gorgeous and the old marble flooring amazing. The best thing are these and Sams diner across the road. We swapped rooms as the room on level 4 had a roof that was falling in and the cleaners came in at 5pm - our “upgrade” to the 7th floor was smaller had electrical issues, leaking tap, smaller bathroom, mouldy curtains, no main light that worked a really noisy air con, a hole in the wall, mouldy soap, and a tv that was moody! The desk staff were nice and the guest manager lovely and they were apologetic and helped reimburse resort fees, however the bell boys through the week were unhelpful and didn’t know the area or what was happening."
1062,"So handy for walking into Lagos to visit bars,shops and restaurants.Close to supermarket and Marina to drool over the boats and yachts.Great for chilling before winter in U.K.Car hire not essential but useful for seeing more of Portugal."
1063,"The Sheraton in Lisboa is a nice hotel for what it is, a chain.  Room: Nice and modern. The bathroom was large and all glass. It included a separate area between the toilet and tub with an all glass style bathroom and tub. The room came with a nice size safe and lots of storage. My wife and I were disappointed however with the mattress, it was old and much stiffer than anything we have experienced in our travels. The result was many nights of tossing and turning/numb arms as we tried to get comfortable.  Restaurant:  The lobby restaurant was great, it offered a great selection of food, both local and international and the price was comparable to many of the restaurants around the hotel. The Panorama restaurant had a beautiful view of downtown Lisbon and its food was good. For…"
1064,"Terrible experience! I've stayed here several times before while traveling for work, but encountered bed bugs on my most recent (and final) stay! I awoke in the night to 30+ bites on my face, arms and torso, which swelled into large red welts and persisted for several weeks. I spotted numerous bed bugs crawling on the pillow and sheets. Gross! I had to dispose of my belongings upon my return home.  Management has been completely unhelpful in addressing this issue. I was told to complete an incident report form, which I promptly completed and returned, and have not heard from the hotel since. It's now been 3 months.  My advice to fellow travelers: Protect yourselves and avoid this hotel at all costs!"
1066,"Before arriving we had emailed the hotel to book a parking space in their parking lot. They never answered and we were lucky to get a space when we arrived. When we checked in they forgot to give us the welcoming drink as a gold member. We were given a room very close the elevator, which makes it impossible to sleep. They accepted to give us to another room, which was quiet and much bigger. Why didn't't they give it first. Globally the people at the reception desk are quite cold. We stayed there for five days, during which time the room was never hoovered. Housekeeping does not always renew the bathroom products.  The parking lot is 15 Euros/night. It is a 5-min walk to the station that takes you to Amsterdam central in another 5 minutes. For breakfast, if you do not take it at…"
1067,"We stayed 4 nights and were very disappointed. The view is the only nice point. You do not have good feelings there. You get a page of ""don't do list, they change sheets and towels only once 3 or 4 days, thay make the beds every day but do not clean the room. If you leave the aircondition on when you go to breakfast thay enter your room and shut it down (which is very unpleasant in hot Rio). The hotel is on a very steep hill and you have to be very fit to go up on foot. It is far from the center and you have to use taxi or public transportation. We do not recommend the place. Adina&Itzhak Zafrir"
1068,"I just want to make sure that this property gets another well deserved ""good review"" . During our stay in Paris staff at this location was very helpful and friendly . They took time to advise us with some local activities .Property is clean and well maintained  , very charming. Location is fantastic .Thank you we will be back"
1069,"I chose one special suite in this hotel from website. But the suite we got was not the same like presented in the internet. The pictures did not show the suite I rented, the room was much smaller then showed. We had a tiny balcony, not a private terrace like offered in the internet. Therefore we changed the hotel after the first night."
1070,"The hotel is situated in Oia right in the middle of everything.  Considering how much $$ we were spending at this place we were suprised to have the cab drop us off at the base of a hill that lead up to our hotel.  We were expecting to pull up, be greeted, and be helped with our luggage.  Instead I was left to drag our luggage (mine and my wife's) up a steep hill.  Now I'm no diva and don't mind getting my hands dirty but considering the amount of $$ we were spending I didn't think this was right.  After checking in and escorted to our room we were blown away by the view.  It truly was amazing. Our room was spacious and even had a private balcony where we had breakfast every morning as we looked out to the Aegean Sea.  The room was huge but didn't feel very cozy.  The room…"
1072,"We enjoyed our stay however....  Be careful, very poor customer service. Following our stay here (family of 4 sharing one room with 2 double beds) we discovered that we had been charged an extra $2000 for an additional room we had not stayed in. We had been accused of entering this additional room and staying there, however this was not true. We did not even have the key to this room and had not needed it.After proving that we had in fact not been using the room we have still not been fully refunded 2 months later. The way they dealt with this situation was awful and for this reason we shall not be returning or recommending this hotel."
1073,"I don't usually complain in public, but after seeing the many sycophantic reviews here (are they paid for?) I feel I need to balance them.  1) General room quality  I found my room (room 720) to be very worn out and in need of better maintenance.  The floors and windows were not clean, corners were dusty, the bathroom door wouldn't stay open, the shower door wouldn't close, the toilet wouldn't stop running water, the TV kept cutting out and I needed to call a tech to come and fix it (it looked like the wires were held together with ordinary sticky tape).  2) The wifi debacle  I really needed to work online as I had a big conference going on and other things. I chose this hotel because it had wifi in the rooms.  After I was there for 1 day the wifi stopped working. Despite…"
1074,Good and nice apartment . Good location we injoy there with the hotel . And the warkere very helpful they try to help you . And I have a small point for the bathroom should put a washing pipe for the w. C  . And all thing is good . And you will injoy with the hotel 
1075,"The hotel is good overall, the breakfast was fine and the lobby actually pretty new and stylish. The location is not bad either: just a 5 minutes walk to Calle Florida and its metro station. The problem is that the furniture is not as new as I'd like to. The room is spacious (the kitchenette is great!) but it lack personality. The bathroom is certainly the worst part: small and without windows, it gets super warm while you're showering and it stays humid for so long..Besides, the towels are washed with some sort of product that has an AWFUL smell. Really, I could barely use them, the smell was terrible. I think it has potential to become a nice hotel: it just needs some renovation, soon!"
1076,"This hotel is not at the level that a Ritz Carlton should be, they need serious lessons in how to treat guests.  I had multiple problems from check-in, though the use of the app based checkout.  I did not experience any part of my 1 day stay where I was impressed, delighted, or treated with proper customer service.  A very poor example of an iconic name.  While I understand this is most likely a franchise property, the name Ritz Carlton should have higher standards."
1077,My cat got sick at the hotel. He was perfectly fine before we checked in .We took him to the vet after we checked out and they couldn't save him. He passed away 1-17-17. I also couldn't sleep more then 3-4 hours a night and the toilet was also very uncomfortable for a 6foot tall person. I still can't believe my cat is gone and this place caused him to die!
1081,"Just  reviewing the Casino as we stopped in for some play after dinner in Hue. Out of over 40 slot machines, only 5 were working. The entire Blackjack table was also shut down. When I asked what was happening the response was ""they not working"". Don't embarrass yourselves & just close it completely until you've resolved the issues."
1082,This would have been a five star review but the beds and pillows are just way too hard. And it is a simple fix. Buy some pillow tops for the beds and get some gel pillows.  It led to some poor nights of sleep.   The location is great and the rooms are super clean. The price is good and the staff is very friendly.  If the beds didn’t feel like sleeping on a park bench this would be the ideal place to stay in Lisbon. 
1083,"Following a work trip to Berlin, I met a friend who lives in the UK for a ""girls weekend"" in Berlin.  Homage a Magritte was a lovely, quirky and welcoming base for our weekend, which focused more on art, shopping, eating and walking than the main Berlin tourist sites and museums (which both of us had seen on other visits). The building itself, located in Charlottenburg, is a beautifully maintained older building in a quiet street close to some charming squares, restaurants, cafes (especially the Cafe im Literaturhaus), and smaller sites (like the Kathe Kollwitz museum). (It is also walkable - about 40 minutes or so -  to the Schloss Charlottenburg.)  It is also close to public transportation and a short hop to the center of Berlin.  We were fortunate to be in town for the Berlin…"
1084,"My wife and I have just returned home from 5 nights (should have been 6 but we left early!) at the Praia Ipanema Hotel.  This hotel simply just isn't up to scratch. Although there are some good points, they are overshadowed by many bad ones.  In a nutshell the pool area is great. A heated pool overlooks Ipanema beach and Morro Dois Irmaos (not sugar loaf mountain as stated by another reviewer). The views from the terrace are spectacular and offers an area to escape the hustle and bustle of Rio.   Pedro on reception in also very pleasant and knowledgeable.  Now the not so good stuff . . .  The WIFI at the hotel is a disgrace. Not only are you charged 25R$ per day, the speed is equivalent to dial up in the 1990s! In this day and age there is no excuse for poor internet speed and…"
1085,"Location is great, close to every important touristic places in Berlin. Clean rooms. Internet connection was great. Sleeping can be tough sometimes because of bar and other visitors but it was something expected. Stuff was helpful and nice. Thank you. "
1086,"First I have a family of 5, 3 kids ages under 12.  When making the reservation I was told I could have a connecting Ocean Front rooms.  One for my husband and I, the 2nd room for kids that would be connecting.  After arriving to hotel my reservation was no where to be found, then discovered but after an 11 hour flight not the words you want to hear.  I was then told they don't even have connecting Ocean Front rooms.  no such thing.  They offered me 2 ocean front rooms but they didn't connect.  I am not comfortable putting kids in one room and us in another.  After much disappointment and arguing they found connecting rooms for us but ocean view.  It wasn't what I paid for and they didn't give me any refund.  Basically told me too bad.  We went to our rooms to discover a decent…"
1087,"I've traveled to 43 countries and have stayed at many Embassy Suites around the world, thus I'm also a Hilton Honors member. If there is one thing is that almost every Embassy Suites are consistent, so you've learned what to expect. This time, it was unlike any other experience with Embassy Suites.  First, when I went to book the room I noticed they had a great deal on a ""non-suite"" room. Basically it was described as a room without the living room. The amenities listed included a tub/shower combination. Upon entering the room, my love and I find only a stand-up shower, that' won't work for my love and we were staying two nights in Chicago. I booked a double room for our friend coming in from San Fransisco who would arrive a couple of hours later.  I go down to the front desk,…"
1088,"After driving all night, I SPENT MY TIME CALLING TO ASK ABOUT AVAILABILITY AND FEES ASSOCIATED WITH CHECK IN so we could be aware in our choice of where to stay. We were told we could not make reservations over the phone which began my frustration, as I had a credit card ready and wanted to be able to check in and go to sleep. That not being an option, the lazy man answering the phones late at night ensured me to just come in and it wouldn't take long. It did. Unfortunately, we wasted the Chicago leg of our family vacation on this suspiciously inexpensive Hilton. I should have known if its too good to be true it probably is. We only stayed as a ""day guest"". Meaning we arrived exhausted at 5am and planned to leave within 6 hours. We paid $50+ tax for TWELVE HOURS IN THIS HOTEL.…"
1089,"There is no parking as the hotel is under construction. The rooms are dirty and dated. In the ice machine/vending area was bags of trash, torn up floors and looked like a crack house. Someone had put 2 random pieces of tape across it which made it look worse. The non-smoking rooms smell like smoke. The bed was nice but, I honestly did not feel safe or clean. My company booked a training here so I had to stay 3 nights or I would had left immediately after checking in."
1090,"We enjoyed the concept of this hotel. It's environmentally conscious and in a great neighborhood with loads of vegan restaurants and lovely fair trade fashion boutiques. The staff is friendly and helpful. Our main complaint, although I think this may be just a common thing in Europe, is that the mattress was super firm and uncomfortable. Wi-FI is spotty but that is also the case in every hotel on the planet. "
1092,"Apart from great breakfast and good internet, this was a terrible experience: not enough hot water for the shower, bathroom flooding, not replacing water in the minibar, door not locking, badly placed pier sockets and too few of them, basin with poor water draining, slow elevators, not enoughcheck-in staff, unclean room, airco not warming the room. This used to be a good place before Wyndham took over."
1094,"I travel a lot and usually prefer staying at one of the larger brand hotels. This place had a boutique hotel vibe in SF so decided to give it a shot. After having a confirmed booking, I was told during check-in that the hotel was overbooked and my room had been given to someone else. Worst than united!  Again, important to note that they only told me this when I arrived at the hotel at 7PM to check-in and not before. They then offered me complimentary stay at another hotel but I was given a room 1/3rd the size of my original booking in a really crappy hotel next door that they have some kind of running arrangement with. Gave me the sense that the overbooking scheme is a usual thing for them.  There are so many good hotels in the city that I would never ever recommend taking a…"
1095,I stayed in a spacious room with windows facing Sorbonne. Back windows were facing a quiet street. The stuff was very helpful. On the square outside the hotel there is a nice restaurant. It’s in the heart of Latin quartal with many students. It’s quite safe there compare to other places in Paris these days. 
1096,"I stayed four nights that Mercure - Wittenbergplatz and was really happy that glowing reviews matched that of my experienced. The hotel staff was friendly and hospitable at every interaction. Even the standard room felt large; given the high ceilings and the design accents that gave the room a lofty feel. The bathroom was equipped with a rainfall style shower head, heated rack and a lot of hotel-branded toiletries.   Located just feet from a U-Bahn station and equally close to one of the largest department stores in the area ( with an amazing food hall); the location of the Mercure is fantastic for anyone touring Berlin for the first time.   Also, make sure you grab a complimentary apple from the lobby before you leave on your daily adventures!"
1098,"We stayed for 3 nights and the hotel was perfect. A small room but it had everything we needed, including  a Nespresso coffee machine which was a nice touch. The location is great, only 2/3 minutes walk from the Alesia Metro station for travelling around Paris and 10 minutes to the Denfert-Rochereau station with a connection to CDG Airport. The staff were very friendly, welcoming and helpful. The WiFi is very good and free. I would highly recommend Hotel Max."
1099,"Stayed there for two nights for my birthday to explore SF. Door sevice is terrible if you are not using VIP parking, and they don't take care of your forgotten item once you left. I lost my credit card there and no one found it. I have to cancel my card to prevent other potential loss. Never go back and would not recommend to others."
1100,"We enjoyed the stay there. It has a well-equipped kitchen with fridge, dishwasher and basic kitchenware, but cooking oil is not included. (Small packs of salt and pepper are provided.) The bathtub is really good and clean. The towels are clean, too. The bed is quite comfortable. There isn't much warm meal choices for the breakfast, only the scrabbled egg and boiled egg. "
1101,"This hotel located on the ""5th Avenue"" of Barcelona is charming and very well located.  The rooms are clean, comfortable and artfully decorated.  Some have private balconies.  My only issue with the room was the complete lack of any type of dresser - there are literally no drawers, just a few random shelves in the closet.   So a couple will have to be creative finding places to put all their clothes that don't hang. But we spent very little time in the room anyway so it was all perfectly fine.   We were given a bottle of cava upon check in (very nice) - plus they offer it every night at 6 in the lounge.   Nespresso maker in the room also - I miss that the most!!.     The staff are all extremely friendly and they speak fluent English.  I will say however that as nice as they are…"
1102,"We were in the city for the Tom Petty concert and decided to make a fun date night of the event. I found this hotel online and it pictures looked lovely and the location worked great! That was my last good impression of this property. This hotel is not at all what is represented on the website and it certainly, in no way, is what we expect in Chicago when we pay $300+ night. The experience started at check in with a rough and rushed greeting. I didn't see any bell staff, no one offered to help us or greet us, we just found a lady sitting behind a desk barely saying hello. The hotel room was dark, gloomy, outdated to the point of ridiculousness (we are talking bent shower rod, salmon tile, soap dispensers attached to the wall, old sink/ toilet and fluorescent light that blinked…"
1103,"Stayed at the Freeland during a busy July weekend.  Staff were super friendly and very warm.  The rooms were pretty bare-bones.  There was no decoration and the furniture was a mismatch.  We stayed in room #1, in the basement, which was dark and stuffy.  We opened the window, when we could, but that invited in mosquitos.  There was a fan that kept the air moving, but still it was very dark.  Shower was comfortable -- good water pressure.  The most difficult part was the toilet wasn't just down the hall -- it was up a steep flight of steps and was crazy-small.  I'm not a heavy person, and I barely fit.  I think this would be a really difficult set up for anyone who has any sort of mobility issues.  I'm in good shape and walked up the stairs sideways with both hands on the…"
1104,"The reviews absolutely reflect our recent experience . My husband had said, ""Paris? Never again."" And then I found la Villa du Square and Christophe. Now he says, ""When we go next...""  The major architectural attractions - the Villa la Roche by LeCorbusier and Frank Gehry's Vuitton Foundation building - led us to that part of Paris. And will lead us there again."
1105,-NO free WIFI at rooms. -Palace Hotel encourages people to go to indoor swimming pool to eat (even wearing jackets!) and to watch TV and films instead of swimming. -Chlorine in excess in the swimming pool. -Palace only provides one bathrobe per room; even if you are a couple. -Palace Hotel is not a 5 star hotel.
1106,"Sorry to say I agree with the last posting, had great expectations, however it didn't quite live up to it!  Staff very attentive, friendly and courteous. Lovely setting in the gardens and public rooms very nicely furnished. Restaurant very slow service, waiting up to an hour at times between courses. The water & wine were taken away from the table, which meant the staff had more toing & froing, when the food should have been served.  Room very comfortable except the bed creaked soo loudly! Many returning guests here, I think we would only return on B&B basis."
1107,"I stayed there from Feb. 28th until Mar. 01st. Rooms are ok. Breakfast is served in an improvised tent in the back of the hotel. Room service takes very, very, very long, and the dishes are bad and overcharged!   Last time I stay here, at least when it’s my option!"
1108,"Location is very good: a quite street far enough from traffic noise, but close enough to reach shopping streets and underground stations. There are few very good supermarkets rather close to the hotel, it does make sense to prepare meals on your own. The appartment was clean, no problem for children if they are not yet walking. There were few families with small children in the same corridor as our appartment, but we haven’t heard them, meaning that sound isolation in the hotel is good. We experienced small errors during our stay, but the staff reacted effectively and made sure that our impression become 100% positive at the end."
1109,"I drive up to the curb in front where the sign says valet except they don't have a valet. The ""concierge"" can see me inside but just sits there. I finally walk into the lobby to ask for the valet and the""concierge"" doesn't say anything, he just point to the front desk. I press him and he says "" I just clean the carpets"". I am not making this up.  The place is a dump and only stayed because the town was booked for Americas Cup."
1110,"Very close to train...solo room is nice but the toilet and the shower is little small Clean room, but dont have shuttle from or to airports  but they order taxi with no problem  Value for the money....."
1111,"Overall, it's still a good choice. next time we may choose the hotel again. but it is better that any one could find taxi for us. bcz the first time we stood in front the hotel and look for taxi by ourselves. this matter need to be improved. thank you."
1112,"Very good hotel, staff very hepful,great location in Berlin, clean and tidy. I would use this hotel again when i visit Berlin. Great location for the XMas markets, tourist attrections and local bars and resturants "
1114,"We stayed here for 3 nights. The hotel is beautiful and the location is fantastic. Rooms are modern and spotless. I would like to specifically mention the staff both on day duty and night duty , great and couldn’t do enough for you . I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend this hotel "
1115,"This hotel had clean, basic rooms.  It's conveniently located just minutes from the museums which is a plus. Tram stop just a few minutes away. Just a heads up for families with young kids, there is a ""red light"" building near by so if you don't want your kids to see that, FYI.  They do offer free wifi but it's very slow, when  it's working. But the staff is really helpful and welcoming, which is nice if it's your first time in Amsterdam. "
1116,"Nice looking hotel with mediocre facilities (no mini-bar, no room service menu) and services (takes long time to get attention at the bar, towel change missed). Breakfast is good (busides orange juice, which is some kind of watered down sirup as in most Swedish hotels). When engaged staff is friendly, but overall they are not attentative enough."
1117,"My wife and I stayed here and loved the hotel and the location.  You can get a great view of the city and it is within walking distance to many great restaurants and shopping.  They offer a very good breakfast buffet.  The room was clean and the bed very comfortable.  So then why do I rate it terrible?  For one reason, the valet service,   We had the unfortunate situation where our car was clearly broken into while it was parked.  The actual valet was very sorry and filled out a report and said the Manager would call us within 24 hours and we would be reimbursed for our losses.  He said it was quite evident that the car was broken into since the glove box and other storage areas in the car were wide open and stuff was thrown all over the place.  I know it states when you park to…"
1118,"Hotel looks better on the pictures! Our room was not really clean and also very old, all the dirt were damaged and the bathroom wasn’t clean.We asked for another room the manager told us that basically all the room were in the same condition as our ( old with broken furniture) but he was kind and upgrade us for the 5 days out of our trip of 8 days. But still the other wasn’t not so much better the AC broke a lot of water on the floor and DVD player wasn’t working. And also twice a day we need to go the reception and do the waiting line because our card for the room wasn’t working !!! Wasn’t fix or anything. Cleaning personal not very friendly .And yes they say breakfast included the only thing you have is a buffet for everyone with only fews stuff to eat and you need get up…"
1119,"I asked for a high floor and got 5th, the rainshower had a very nice pressure but in one stormy night the wind was blowing through the room and the door to the balcony was banging. The bar on the 17th floor has a great view."
1120,"Stayed there for 2 nights with 147 x 15 year old kids :) great place, good service and good food! Hotel is old fasioned but well keept, and clean.  A bit remote place no services around. Great bar at site and good resturant."
1121,Not many of the staff speak english so be prepared. 
1122,"I had mold in my bathroom, no thermostat to control temp.  Very small room.  Although the location was good, hotel is right on tram tracks so you hear noise outside your room throughout the night.  There are better places to stay"
1123,"We had 3 nights here and found it to be very comfortable. Well appointed. Furnishings are fairly old but generally in good condition. The staff were mostly very helpful and accommodating. The alfresco bar at one time had one waitress that wasn’t very pleasant though. Admittedly it was fairly busy but She was very abrupt and impatient, banding our beers down on the table. "
1124,"This used to be our favorite hotel in Sao Paulo. Prime location, classic decor, small and cozy rooms. Quiet and clean. BUT time passes and things change. All above is still there. But: our room wasn’t ready for check-in until 4pm, shower drain was partially blocked (disgusting and annoying), carpets stained... And we noticed reception desk staff is extremely rude - with all guests. Which is unacceptable in a 5* hotel.  Keeping it short: this is no longer a 5* hotel. "
1125,"Beautiful hotel, perfect location and amazing customer service (thanks Pablo and team!)  There is a nice terrace on the river, however it was only open in one side as the rest was being renovated, did not bother us much however we would have liked to enjoy the full thing.  Cannot recommend enough  PS- The rooms facing the river and the bridge are bigger! ;-)"
1126,"Excellent location across from Ipanema Beach.  Our room was only efficient - nothing special about it.  When another guest closed their door or spoke in the hallway, we could hear through thin walls. Staff very friendly and helpful but I would not recommend staying at this hotel.   Needs some upgrades.  I think this hotel wants to be trendy but doesn't make the cut."
1127,"Very good location, not to mention the price which is really cheap. Clean place and the best part - not crowded. Perfect atmosphere for people who are backpacking and want to go back to have a good shower and rest."
1129,"Nice rooms and lobby.  First 2 nights were perfect but when I came back from dinner the last night there were about 200 people lined up for the Disco Club on level ""C.""   For some reason the club levels are on floors 2-3 and it was impossible to sleep with the noise of the base.  After 2 calls to complain at 1:00 AM they moved me to a room on the top floor.  Great response by the staff but unacceptable for a Club to be so noisy that its impossible to sleep in the rooms at a nice (and quite expensive) Sheraton."
1130,"Do not book for 4 as suggested with 2 double beds. I had to find another hotel after visiting the room on October 27th, and they wouldn’t cancel my reservation. It costed me the full night plus service. Do not get fooled. Stay away"
1131,"Room is modern, with excellent bathroom w/tub-shower, small safe, closet, and street view. Bed very comfortable. Staff VERY helpful in meeting our needs, helping understand transportation, and helping coordinate airport shuttle."
1132,"I really wanted to like this place. Every year my husband and I get away to Honolulu just to have a few days to ourselves. Well this year we were also preparing for me to retire in the next four months. Instead of canceling or trip we decided to cut back on expenses. I knew when I booked the hotel  I wasn't reserving a 5 star posh hotel. I just wanted clean and comfortable. I started off okay everything was as promised from the fresh juice at check in to friendly customer service with front desk staff. We were assigned to room 1208 with a decent view of the ocean. Cleanliness isn't one of this hotel's strengths. The shower was large but the drain looks as though it hasn't been cleaned in years. There was hair everywhere, television (yes the t.v.) was filthy and I am not sure…"
1133,"I stayed at this hotel during the summer and it was a wonderful experience, but the during the winter the service had declined. They checked me into a room with a broken heater. Also my family and I left at 9 am and returned at 5:00 pm no one had come to clean the room or even change the sheets. I was really disappointed and unfortunately will have to find somewhere else to stay next summer."
1134,"Had a bit of a nightmare with another hotel my girlfriend and I were originally booked into, and we were thankfully rescued by this lovely Ibis hotel which was a couple of blocks down the road.   The hotel itself seemed to be in a nice and convenient area. There was a bar next door, and a few Metro stations within walking distance.   As soon as we arrived at the main reception, the staff were very friendly and greeting; thankfully for us they spoke English. We explained our situation, and that we hadn’t made a reservation, and they were very accommodating and gave us a room, which was ready straight away! The staff then explained that we were able to come and go from the hotel whenever we pleased, as there would always be someone at the reception to let us back into the…"
1135,Do not stay here!   Absolutely after 34 years of travel Worst hotel on the planet.. Ricardo the security manager was simply alwful. Do not stay here ... worst jw Marriot.  Wouldn’t comp the night we had to move. Wouldnt upgrade is as water was flooding our bathroom. Simply alwful.   Toilet flooded the bathroom.. They acted as though It was our fault.    Do not spend one penny at this Marriott.  Worst customer service.  Rating should zero.
1136,"This Sheraton is the worst Sheraton I've experienced.  The service is bad, the room is old.  The chair doesn't work and it's broken, I had to ask for a new one. There is no electrical out for me to recharge my phone and camera, they had to buy a new extension cord to solve the problem, Room 625. The concierge staff wasn't very helpful. While it has a good location, but if it's a Sheraton, this doesn't live up to par."
1137,"Well designed room, comfortable, quiet and clean. Very quiet location, near a Tube stop, a bit far from the city centre, in a quiet quarter. Staff very polite and friendly, stunning air conditioning in the middle of the last heat weather episode."
1138,"I stayed 3 nights at this beautiful hotel. On arrival the lady at the reception quickly arranged for me to be booked at the local coiffeur. All rooms come fully equipped with its own Nespresso machine. A bonus for a coffee-holic such as I. You will get free WIFI. Ask for an international plug and pocket WIFI if you need. I paired 3 devices and still enjoyed good fast connection. The rooms are generally small, but neat and cosy. The bathroom is refreshing with its own rain shower. Vanity mirror is small.Good comfy bed with great linen. If you need air take a stroll, with Champs Elysees a mere 15 mins away."
1139,"This was our first stay in Lisbon and we wanted to experience something a little smaller than a traditional hotel.  The Memmo Alfama is in an area of Lisbon that is undergoing a huge transformation.  Its one of the oldest parts of the city, with cute little restaurants within walking distance.  The hotel itself, is small and we stayed in the Terrace Room with a view of the water.  Thank god, as the rooms are very small and tend to be very claustrophobic...yes even for European standards.  The bathrooms are so small you can barely turn around in them.  We found the staff to be very professional and the breakfast buffet sufficient.  One major problem was the entrance into the Hotel.  In some cases, the taxi drivers' would not drive down the very narrow laneway to the hotel.  As I…"
1140,"We have just returned from a weekend break.  Nice enough room, clean, decent sized bathroom - although not actually a double bed, more like 2 singles pushed together. Downside was thin walls in the rooms, could hear everything in the adjoining room (we were in 223 not sure if different in other rooms)- definitely bring ear plugs for a good nights sleep! The view we had was onto other rooms so had to keep the curtains closed, didn't bother us as we were out day/night - again not sure if this is similar with the rest of the rooms.  Location is superb - 2 minute walk to Las Ramblas but quiet on a night time.  Would stay again purely for the location."
1141,"Really nice location, room is awesome and pool also (rooftop).been here for 1 week from Australia . The reason i give 5 stars because i asked front desk for quarter for washing machine, and Jessica every day is not helping . However, Armani from the bar went all the way to Walgreens to get coins for me. That was outstanding Armani!!! Thank you!!! Front desk should  be more helpful to the guests! "
1143,"service: average  lounge: forget out it.  to get a beer you need to be seated.  if there is not seat you may get a beer at the hair cut store next door. that was the atendent directions.   room: old and smelly, and they gave me na update.  I imagine what the my original room would have been.  ask for no room service and got one anyway. my partner was very embarraced as we had many of our toys around the room.   fitness room: guess what, you have to pay a fee if you want to use it.  i have been in thousands of hotel in my life and this is the first time a got a charge to use the fitness room.   when you are inside, the place is really dirty, old, swuiming pool wall very crusty.  parking: R$45/day, when the parking next door charges you only R$15.   overall cleaness: greasy…"
1144,"The bottom line - the Hotel de Londres Eiffel is excellent in terms of quality, affordability, location and service.  My wife and I stayed at the hotel for nine days (Sept 28-Oct 6) as part of the Rick Steves' Tour Group.  It is within easy walking distance of several popular sites in west Paris, including the Eiffel Tower, Champ de Mars Parc, Rue Cler and the beautiful walkway along the Seine River.  Several high quality restaurants and stores are nearby (including two just a half-block down the streeet), and a metro stop is 4-5 blocks away that provides easy access to the entire city as well as the airport, train stations, Versailles and Chartres. The rooms are clean and quite comfortable, and the continental breakfast is robust and quite ""French.""  No skimping on coffee here.…"
1146,"I stayed here when it was Hotel Palomar and am a loyal Kimpton Karma member. My stay at the hotel was great, as is usual with stays at Kimpton properties. Their customer service is top-notch. New ownership at Hotel Zelos would do well to take some pointers.  Unfortunately, I checked out a few days before the hotel changed hands. Upon my return home, I noticed mini-bar charges that were incorrectly billed. I was told by Kimpton that I have to work with Hotel Zelos directly as they have to make this credit to my account. I've been trying to get this resolved for the last 2 weeks. I've left several messages with the accounting department, including 2 with the accounting manager. I also spoke with the front desk to speak with a live person. She, at least, was helpful in confirming…"
1147,"What a wonderful room,nicely decorated and so clean. Staff so friendly in reception and in breakfast area,breakfast also very good. Location is best in Berlin,beside the famous department store KDW. Waiting to return soon!"
1148,"The location is excellent for sightseeing, restaurants, shopping and the beach is a10min walk,perfect! The hotel is quirky, rooms very comfortable and spotless. The reception staff were very welcoming and helpful showing us on a map best places to visit and eat. We had breakfast at the hotel the assortment was amazing and fantastic value."
1149,"A small hotel in compact grounds with well tended gardens. The old building and extension surround the pool which under curved twinwall polycarbonate roof. The decor and furniture are pleasant if dated. We were pleansantly surprised at the quality of the half board meals - wheat soup, pork cheeks, beef skewers and tune steak were the most popular.  However, the hotel is very understaffed (and undertrained) so service suffers. We waited 30 minutes from the serving of the first drink of a round of 6 and only got that when we chased it up. There is no bar but a cupboard in the longue which does the basics with Gin and tonic the only cocktail they can manage - definite no to a request for a Mojito. There is one lady who works hard in the evening shift but she has to cover reception…"
1150,"I stayed in Jing-an Shangrila two nights on the way to another city, and one night on the way back home in July.   The first two nights were on 14-15 July. It was overall pretty good experience. Just as I expected from Shangri-La which I use regularly. The standard room was nice and cosy, with great city views. Bathroom was clean and generous.   The second time was on my way back home due to a flight delay. I had to pay extra for a Horizon club room because they ran out of standard rooms which I booked on the official website before arriving to the hotel.   Staff at the breakfast area did not have good manners, they would not give way if they run into you, even if you got your hands full, they will still walk in front of you.   The housekeeping knocked on my door and opened my…"
1151,"The hotel is clean, situated at about 150 meters from Pernety metro station on Line 13. The neighborhood is quiet, with lots of restaurants to choose from. The staff is friendly. The rooms are small ( but quite normal for Paris), clean, modern with very comfortable beds. The shower is amazing.The walls are paper thin which doesn't reallt matter if you have civilized neighbours. Ours weren't, but the hotel staff were amazing taking care of that so Thank You for that.  We will definitely come back here in the future and we recommend this hotel ."
1153,"Very close to Berlin's hauptbahnhof and not too far away from Tegel airport, the hotel is located in the heart of a very busy happening place. Very helpful & smiling hotel staff, the room was decent without being overly done up. Hecker's is also very close to the local train station connecting different parts of Berlin and Potsdam. We had to walk for a few minutes to board a train to Potsdam. The place is well connected by a bus service to the Tegel airport too."
1154,Tv was not working and the technician did not fix the problem. In addition there were not enough coffee and milk in the room.  Apart from that the bed was really comfortable and nice. Loved the sheets and toiletries. 
1155,"Towels extremely dirty and old. Bed unconfortable. Despite that, friendly personnel. Good breakfast. You could order special coffee for extra money - that was of good quality. Located next to ""night life"" in the old town."
1156,"As a Platinum member of the Le Club I generally opt for Sofitel Hotels. I have to admit that this particular hotel does in no one live up to the standards of service you would expect and do experience from other Sofitel hotels. From the moment of walking in, there was not help with luggage, no mention of the club lounge and times and services available, no mention of internet policy, no help with getting taxi apart from being told to wait outside and in general a lack of service ability by the staff. I was very surprised and disappointed of the lack of service offered in this hotel after even recently experiencing such great service in Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh. The rooms and great, clean and have all the amenities with even a good breakfast and the hotel is in a good location but…"
1157,Our family loved the Hotel Eiffel Seine!  The hotel was within walking minutes to The Eiffel Tower.  The hotel was a cool place in a cool location!  I would recommend reserving the Hotel Eiffel Seine months in advance.
1158,We enjoyed this quint hotel and they told us where us Americans could find ice!! It is close to all walking and busing areas of the city and also to the restaurants and bars in the area. We really enjoyed our overnight stay there.
1159,"Our entire family stayed here (we used Six Rooms!) for a brief visit to the Paris area. We found it a pleasant walk to Notre Dame Cathedral (Three days after the Terrible Fire - Quelle tragédie. We also walked to the Louvre and from there took a boat ride to the Eiffel tower. Transportation was easily available for other sights and we recommend using it as driving in Paris was quite daunting - Parking was often difficult at the tourist destinations. Although the some of the rooms were tiny, We Highly recommend Best Western Plus La Demeure!"
1160,"Stayed few nights there as part of Aconcagua expedition. Hotel rooms were are backdated, cleanliness was ok, but not that great. Breakfast was cold everyday and same menu, there was no hot breakfast or egg which was surprising to me compared to the price I paid. Some staffs were friendly but most of them spoke very little English. The elevators were extremely slow and very small. Hotel has wifi but most of the time the wifi didn't work or extremely slow. I wish if the management try to fix at least the breakfast menu, wifi and improve the cleanliness of the rooms. The location of the hotel was good, most of the places were either accessible by short walk or by taxi with a very cheap price.Oh one thing forgot to mention, the room AC's power was extremely low, room AC is very…"
1161,"We enjoyed beautiful 3 days in this motel which is situated near the city centre. We arrived without reservation but this was no problem despite the fact that the motel was occupied. accommodation is very nice, sleeping quality is really perfect, the room and bathroom is very clean. people at the reception were very friendly and helpful. the only thing which should be better is that the room is not very spacious."
1162,"The hostel itself is beautiful and the vietnames working here are also lovely,but Jamie who runs the hostel is very obnoxiouse and rude.When we arrived  we were greeted by him saying 'Hey this is a party hostel,its the only place to stay in town,if your boring go away' Were two 20 year old irish girls who were up for some fun so we stayed thinking it would be great.  But your basically forced to go out every night or get kicked out.Everynight you get to go for dinner and then on to a club.However this place has deals done with certain restaurants, we went to an overpriced place where we got the worst food in vietnam.Then you go on to a club where drinks are sold at rip-off prices.This happens everynight.It would be great if people chose to go out, but there isn't a choice.On our…"
1163,"We stayed at the Sheraton for 4 nights at the Executive floor 25/F. Very nice view, comfortable bed, spacious room and nice lounge. However there were noises every morning starting at 5:30am that woke up both my husband. Reported the problems 3 times to different staff at the hotel, but nothing was done about it. Very disappointed and I don't think we'll come to this hotel again if we are to visit Lisbon again. "
1164,"Booked 3 nights here to see Phil Collins in the Accor arena.Both Phil and the hotel were equally brilliant! From the stylish modern reception to the extra wide comfortable beds - everything says chic ! The room was well equipped with a little balcony overlooking the street below.Great for people watching. The bathroom was pristine and a good shower flow.The auto hair dryer on the bathroom wall wouldn't be great for long tresses but that wasn't a problem. The complimentary drinks in the fridge were a nice touch and tea and coffee making facilities were provided. Can't speak highly enough about the breakfast though.Cold,hot,cereals,meat,fruit,fresh croissants and even cake Everyone could find something to suit their tastebuds in this buffet. There was a very small gym and English…"
1165,"This was my first time to Paris & I was unsure of the best part of the city to stay & I'm so pleased to have found this gem of a hotel. Located in a quiet residential area I felt safe walking about at all times. Easy access to Metro stations & Gare Saint-Lazare train station made all of Paris readily accessible.  The hotel itself is quite new & very clean. We had a room with a terrace, which was enclosed like a courtyard, & enjoyed the peace & quiet it provided. The room is normal European size which does mean small however the bathroom was of a generous size by comparison to many others I've seen.  All staff I encountered were wonderfully friendly willingly engaging in English conversations with us. A map & metro guide was provided upon check in which came in very handy. There…"
1166,they didn't respect the reservation. Too noisy because of the constructions inside. A lot of dust. one of the elevator doesn't work and the other one is used for the construction staff and guests. a complete not expected experience
1167,"Very warm and friendly staff on the front desk, the hotel was being refurbished but we were upgraded to one of the completed rooms which was very comfortable with much appreciated air conditioning. The hotel is in an excellent location in a busy area near to metro station and so many restaurants to choose from. "
1168,"We have a time share at the Pestana , we were advised when buying that the rooms would be reburshed yearly , not sure this happens. The rooms have started to look tired , pillows are foam bits and not at all comfortable our sheets had holes and the side of the bed is stained . The oven not so good , temperature poor , food will burn if not careful . They have started to charge for parking in their underground car park hence car park virtually empty"
1170," all where better then expected, and Berlin is typically better than average, room - perfect, breakfast , perfect+, stuff, gym, atmosphere  all where the best. even the location that seems a bit out of center is just in front of both Sbhan and  M5/6 tram "
1171,"Stayed there 5 days at the end of a month long trip in Argentina and Chile. I do this trips every year visiting family, friends and whatever fly fishing I can do. Payed $ 125 for a triple. The inside rooms avoid severe street noise, which can ruin your sleep. The rooms I saw had funky small & soft single mattresses, which moved easily away from the box spring till you found yourself tilting out towards the floor. Linen was of low quality and smallish. Towels sometimes had holes and I would have used them in my house, only to clean the floors... WIFI sometimes works. Breakfast food is of low quality.Staff is helpful, but facility sorely needs an update. The San Telmo neighborhood is, what it is. If you want better digs look towards Palermo for about the same money."
1172,"This hotel is a bare minimum place.  Stay here to save money and to be near (but not in) Pelourinho, but only if you are not planning on spending any time in the room.  My wife and I were shown to a room that smelled like smoke (they are ALL smoking rooms we soon learned) and had a view of the other rooms.  When asked to change to a room with a working phone, no cigar smell and a maybe even a view, they looked at us like we were a real pain and treated us poorly (maybe no one asks this there?).  After hearing the guy in the room next to us snore through the night, we decided to leave.  I liked the price but my wife had had enough."
1173,"Sure this a lovely property but not handy to anything and it is not worth paying extra for Club Level the reasons being, my afternoon tea had stale bread.  No service hardly at all for the evening cocktails and very minimal food then with breakfast you had to go into the main busy restaurant to get decent food but the worse of all was going down a difficult dangerous stair case to use the bathroom. The management need to take a look how the InterContinental is run in Saigon and Kuala Lumpur , both are streets ahead with their Club Level."
1174,To be clear I have not yet stayed at this hotel. I was booked for an over night to transition the flight from Australia to catching the TGV. I chose this hotel based on location and reviews. Unfortunately my flight was cancelled and this resulted in a 14 hour delay. I emailed the hotel to cancel the reservation which was now past its date for free cancel. The management kindly offered day use of the room until the train departed. Unfortunately we only had a few hours connect between CDG and GTV. With this information the management very generously cancelled without charge. Much appreciated and I will be sure to try to return.
1175,"Everything was perfect. Efficient staff. A place to recommend. excellent service. Perfect cleanliness. Nice swimming-pool. A perfect place for holiday, honeymoon and family trip. I'll be back with great pleasure.                                             "
1177,"Great airport hotel, friendly staff, quality food, well maintained, reliable punctual shuttle bus. Quiet and dark room, comfortable bed. New bathroom with heated floor. Wifi blistering fast in bar and corridor but very poor in room, in fact unusable in some rooms."
1178,Three days without our room being cleaned or receiving any fresh towels in spite of repeated requests to reception. Door indicator was broken and never fixed. Shower was leaking leaving the bathroom floor soaking wet. Reported and never fixed. I would recommend staying elsewhere.
1179,this hotel only has one thing going for it- it is on the outskirts of the recoleta area- Room was not cleaned for us-came home to room that had not been touched--very old and dated-charged for wifi-ng
1180,"We are planning to spend a full day in SF with our son who travels from overseas.  Our (online) reservation was made directly with the Hotel for 13 -14 April with prepaid and nonrefundable. He also will be staying in same hotel  Due circumstances beyond our control, we had to change the date to a day earlier. Now this hotel wants us to pay additional $295 for a new reservation. This it outrageous - just to change the date to a day earlier?  I talked with 3 customer service personnel. The first (Angela) took our request and promised someone from management will get back to us - none ever called back.  The 2nd one (Natasha) told me ""no problem, I will change it for you"". Before I could get the confirmation #, we were disconnected. The 3rd one point blank said ""I Can't change it,…"
1181,"Visited the hostel last time, this time went to the hotel- was lovely! Great staff, sweet room and a beautiful breakfast ☺️ Hated to leave but there's something to look forward to next time in Berlin.."
1182,"Henri Hotel do deliver what the promise; high quality in a sober context for a good price! Warm and friendly service, fantastic beds and the rooms; huge and very good! Breakfast stands up the the remaining level. If one thing to be critical about, it`s their internet (that`s free for guests) is not up to it at floor 4.. a bit on and off, but thats also the only negative thing with this charming and cool hotel placed centrally in Berlin."
1183,"This hotel has the basics but is not really good value for money. On the plus side it is very clean with an excellent breakfast. Some of the staff were very helpful.   On the down side - the rooms are tiny, hardly any space and certainly not enough to do any work. Also need a bit of a facelift. The most annoying this was the intermittent wifi. When we asked about it the staff were unhelpful saying it was a problem with windows 10 (this wasn't the case as it also happened on android devices.   Overall, OK but expensive for what you get."
1184,"I don't know if the Hotel Marignan was just renovated but it certainly has that feel.  Everything is fresh and clean and absolutely charming.  There's a farmer's market, a myriad of fabulous cafes and restaurants and a metro stop nearby. Being in the Latin Quarter we were able to be tourists to plenty of sites in walking distance without being immersed in tourists throughout the district. When and if I return to Paris, I will look no further than the Hotel Marignan for comfortable, convenient and friendly lodging."
1185,"We stayed at the Quinta at the end of Portugal's wettest and stormiest winters on record. It would have been good to be told in advance that the lane to the Quinta was impassible with waist deep flood water spilling across the ford at the end of the lane. We managed to find the back entrance with the help of the local cafe owner, who knew the husband of the lady who cleans the Quinta. Reaching the Quinta by way of the back entrance involves a muddy shlep across a farm track - I have my doubts that people less able than ourselves would cope with the conditions under foot. Our local ""guide"" phoned ahead and Julio came to meet us with a wheelbarrow. Having specified we wanted an evening meal on arrival, we were disappointed to discover the hosts do not provide evening meals at the…"
1186,"Very good location, very friendly staff, nice and big room. Only low point is the smoking in the other room next to us, very strong. We wanted to buy two ticket for the museums in the city, we asked the staff and they told us to buy with so we don't have to queue up, but when we got to the museum it was for the wrong one, please check the tickets after buying it. "
1187,"The location of the hotel is great. Flat area of Lisbon down by the waterfront. Steps away from Praca de Comercio and the metro/trams/buses etc.   Unfortunately, for us, this is where the greatness ends.   The hotel does look very impressive and they have done an excellent job at creating a trad/modern vibe. The reception area is gorgeous.  We had a suite facing the square. With the double glazing the room is very quiet. The room was large enough with a table, two chairs and a kitchenette we didn't use. The bathroom is very small and inconvenient. Also, there is a clear issue with mould/ventilation.  The bed is comfortable, however we asked for a couple of extra pillows as we had only been given one each and the response from reception was not what you would expect/hope for.…"
1188,"Decoration, somewhat outdated, bathroom faucettes not working properly, low and unstable water pressure, web tv unavailable, queen bed instead of king size (according to reservation), no valet parking available, error in account at checkout (then fixed), dirt and untidiness at outside pool area, lack of enough chairs at pool (we had to lean directly on the floor), limited food variety and quality at lobby and pool bar, parking lot access with large and dangerous holes on the floor. Deceiving..."
1189,"I loved this hotel. Really enjoyed our stay. Great location to Gare du nord and Moulin Rouge. Staff were brilliant and the hotel was really lovely, room was perfect. Highly recommend this hotel, will definitely stay there again."
1191,"Sometimes these big hotels can be really disappointing, but not this one. We loved it and had a perfect three night stay. Lovely rooms, excellent service, friendly staff, super breakfast and top location. "
1192,"I normally love any property in the Marriott family and have been a gold elite member for the past few years. Due to business meetings, I've stayed in 2 other Rio hotels this past week and am extremely disappointed with both the check in experience and the room :( (this comment is relative to other Marriott properties and the other Rio hotel brands). Unfortunately, I guess not every hotel within the Marriott brand can always be exemplary. "
1193,"I thought I was at a Motel 6 off the freeway.. room is in disrepair. Mold in the bathroom, ceiling texture is falling off,  furniture is damaged I love you of the parking lot. And that’s what the Hilton diamond member gets. I can’t imagine what a regular guest has to deal with. They even cut the ground connection off the microwave plug. This place has really hit rock bottom."
1194,"This hotel is situated in the heart of the red light district where everything is happening.enjoyed my 2 night stay here bed was comfy shower was good etc everything tidy.downfalls where if you can't do steps don't bother their very steep and plentiful,could be noisy in the night at times,the beer in the downstairs bar was terrible at times would return if need be.maybe?"
1195,"I had read the reviews and cannot disagree with them more - if you want 5* then book and pay for that!  For a 3* hotel and we went all inclusive I cannot fault the staff, the food in the morning/lunch was what you would expect however the evening meals were lovely."
1196,"This hotel has the perfect location and it is clean and comfortable. Noémie and Cédric are very accommodating and super welcoming. The decor is chic and modern. Everything is brand new. The bed was comfortable and Noémie gave us extra pillows. The room was small but who needs more? The bathroom was small yet it had the best shower we had on this visit. The neighborhood was adorable and neighboring shops were wonderful. The room was not expensive- frankly it was better than some 3 star hotels we stayed in! There is a breakfast room where guests can make tea, and keep food in the fridge. Will come back ASAP! Merci!"
1197,Awesome place. Such a good location being at the train station and only a 10 minute walk from the holocaus museum. Would happily stay again the staff are friendly and the rooms are clean.  Super happy with this place.
1199,"This is a very modern hotel in a great location- close enough to the Alexanderplatz but not too close to hear the noise from there. The breakfast was good and the scrambled eggs terrific. The only thing that we didn’t like were the bunk beds!! For me, my husband and my 12 year old daughter it was quite an experience..."
1200,"My daughter and I spent three nights here as part of a group tour (therefore, I can't comment on price or value, as the tour included hotel costs, of course).  The hotel is very elegant and very centrally located.  Our room was very large and comfortable, and the bathroom was really huge and luxurious.  Breakfast pancakes were excellent."
1201,"Stayed here as it was convenient for meetings. Everything was fine - prompt, polite service and a great curry wurst. Room was functional but fine and got a great night's sleep.  Free wifi worked throughout the hotel. "
1202,The hotel is located near a tramway line and close to the major beaches in Barcelona. The hotel is cosy and quiet and convenient for a business trip. The hotel restaurant is good (but don't expect to eat very local dishes) and employees obliging. Breakfast is excellent with a great variety of food (even for vegans).
1203,"We stayed here for a memorial day weekend and was severely disappointed. I have visited numerous Wyndham resorts and always excellent. This was by far the worse hotel experience I have had. Let me start with the AC problem. It was extremely hot in the bedroom, and it never cooled down through the night. My husband has MS and heat can trigger his condition. A technician looked at it, and assured us that this was fixed. No, it was not. They instead sent us box fans which was covered in dust by the way. Next the mini fridge was broken. The towels were stained, and the entire experience made for a very uncomfortable weekend. Lastly, the tub was not professionally. The handles were misaligned and you can see the holes on the tiles. The grout was discolored and patchy. I hope the…"
1204,"We stay 4 nights at My story hotel Rossio at late October. We are a family of 4 persons with two children's, 2,5 years old and 4 months. Before any trip i contact direct the hotel so i make some questions because traveling with family is always very difficult and you want to arrange all the things as better as you can. Ms Mariana Ferreira was always very helpful and willing to help as. i saw the reviews on TA that the rooms are little small but the hotel is in a very good place and that are very well soundproofed so we decide to stay at this hotel. After we arrive we have a very fast check in and according that the time was 12:30 our room was ready so we can entered. Our room was at 4th floor which was really nice. The room was really small for our 4 but we try to manage the…"
1205,"This is an apartment building that is being partially rented out as hotel rooms. On booking.com there was no indication that there is no maid service, no amenities, no one to answer the phone and no clear sign about the entrance, especially after hours. You must take out the trash at the end of your stay. It has s musty stale smell in the hallway. The rooms are large but very worn and only top surface clean. They do the dishes by hand and leave them upside down in the cupboard so they don't t really dry properly. Dirty carpet. Good wifi."
1206,"Please don't let the pictures online fool you, this place is not what is looks like online! We booked here based on the great location and the pictures online but when we arrived we were so upset. Our room was very large but filthy! The bathroom smelled VERY strongly of urine, there was mold on the walls and in the bathtub. The carpet was dirty and there was a white creamy substance (I am going to believe it was lotion) on the carpet beside the bed. It was obviously not cleaned at all before we arrived. The furniture was beat up and dirty. The window unit air conditioner was set as low as it could go and never cooled the room below about 85 degrees. My husband went to complain and we were told they could not move us that night but if we brought all of our luggage downstairs in…"
1207,"Stayed here last month and had a very unpleasant experience.  Firstly, the sales team does NOT value Marriott Platinum Members. Expect one tier higher than what you've booked. I requested for suite but they said they ran out of it. Long story short, I booked a night of suite and they finally upgraded after exchanging so many unnecessary emails. Their response is utter rubbish - depending on sales for the day? Ok, so we aren't consider ""as a sale"" then since it is confirmed. They only care about last minute sales to charge higher price that's all. That's their SOP.  Upon second check in, since I've already seen their suite, I just take whatever they have given. They upgraded to Premier and did not offer Executive even when all the rest of the suites were available. I don't really bother about the suite anymore, but it would be nice to show your value by offering the Executive.  NEVERMIND about that. Conclusion - they just don't value their Platinum members.  Check in:  I told them I'm arriving late at 4am, due to late flight arrival. It was late and the late shift staffs are not properly groomed nor anyone even cares, just laughing and being tired in their resting room. I understand it's late but if you're offering such service, be PROFESSIONAL about it. The check in took a longer time as expected but glad it was resolved.  2nd check in was slow too, just too many people. Not as bad as the first but not excellent either.  Check out: Took almost 20 minutes, because they staff just wasn't competent enough to do the job. Later on I found out they only credited 2 nights when I stayed 3 because my arrival was past 12am - so they ""forfeited"" my 1st night. After many dingdongs, they finally submitted my 3 nights stay to Marriott Bonvoy.  It's a pain to talk to any of their staffs because nothing seem to work correctly. The app did not really help either - only for restaurant bookings they were alright but anything more than that they can't do it. Any room related information = forget about it. One of the days, one of the staff was so rude, refuse to even reply after I had texted to check for updates. Jeez!  This hotel is just for you to clock in and out, don't bother to do anything else as their service level is NEGATIVE if I can give them a rating. Breakfast and lounge choices are very good. So if you're typically just going there to stay and leave it's good but if you require good concierge services FORGET about this place as it will drive you nuts.  Stayed here for 6 nights in total, but this will be the last time I'm picking this hotel, saves the pain.…"
1208,"We booked through the Family Homestay per all of the excellent recommendations on TripAdvisor. As we only had one more night in Vietnam, we wanted to make the most of our stay. Scott, the host, is a very friendly guy, however, after assuring us of transportation from the train station to his homestay (20km outside Nihn Bihn), he was nearly 45 minutes late picking us up and abruptly deposited us at the Trang Ban boat tours -lovely!- but with no way of getting from there to his homestay without dropping considerable money on an over priced taxi. Scott assured us later that he would provide free transport back to the city, when we informed him of our limited time. Yet, upon our arrival at the homestay, there was no one to check us in and we were without any information about the…"
1209,- no fridge in the room. - Only one elevator was availabe.... In august with many people we had to wait to get the room on 5th floor.+ clean bedroom+ A large shower very usual for a family !+ nice breakfast
1210,"This beautiful boutique hotel is nestled in the gothic quarter. Great location for exploring on foot.  Something interesting around every corner. We stayed 3 days in a spacious suite. Living area with couch, chairs, dresser and tv. Bedroom with sitting area, king size bed and tv. Really large bathroom with the most toiletries of any hotel I've ever stayed in- the usual shampoo etc and toothbrush, toothpaste, combs and razor. We didn't need them, but very nice to know they were provided if we had needed them.  The staff is fantastic!  Cannot say enough great things about them. So helpful and friendly! The restaurant was amazing. The food was delicious and beautifully presented. Best ceviche I've ever had! The rooftop area was delightful and the perfect place to catch a few rays…"
1211,"My prescription eye glasses were stolen from my ROOM by the housekeeping attendant; other personal items were damaged and tampered too. These stolen/damaged items cost almost $1,000. I've been in communication with Housekeeping/Room management, security, and GM, and already filed a police report. The hotel claims they're currently investigating. However, there is NO RESOLUTION until now. Clearly, the shadiness starts at the management level and is apparent in the housekeeping staff. This is my 1st experience of a theft inside a hotel room and I travel quite a lot. There are other hotels in San Francisco. STAY AWAY FROM THE CLIFT!!!"
1212,"We needed a basic room near the airport for the night. It is a quick 10 minute drive to the airport at 5:30 a.m. Uber came within 3 minutes to pick us up. The hotel has 9 floors and is popular with big groups. The room size is ok. Room is furnished with a fridge and a safe although the furnishings can use an update. Beds are comfortable and bathroom is fine although the towels are gray and worn. The walls are very thin and we can hear the neighbors arguing in Chinese next door. The hotel has an on site restaurant which offered dinner buffet some nights.  Cost us 16 eu drinks not included. The buffet offers a chicken entree, fish entree, rice, pasta, appetizers, salad bar, soup, and 5 dessert options. The food is slightly above average. Service is very good. The hotel packed us a…"
1213,"Weekend 29/7-31/7, family of 3 with 2 yo child:  + Clean and tastefully decorated in modern style (our room was 1st floor with two windows onto street with a Juliet balcony each) + Comfortable beds + Convenient location near Gare du Nord and several Metro stations/lines + Easy to get to main attractions + Pleasant cafes nearby and just minutes walk to L'Opera and Galleries LaFayette + Friendly and professional staff + suitable for young family.  Highly Recommended!"
1214,The hostel is located in a quite central position and is very cheap compared to the rest of Stockholm. Unfortunately the hostel has no windows and this means that the air in the rooms at night is quite bad. In my room there was a girl that was snoring like a tractor and there was also an extra guest (two girls were sleeping in the same bed). I know this things could happen but it is not great. Anyway I have to give 3 points to the hostel because I have stayed there one night only but I guess the review would have been much worse if I would have stayed there longer.
1215,"Hotel is located in the city center. Service is nice  but rooms are outdated and could be more cleaner. Food is average. Near hotel are many museums, nice shops and restaurants, so you can on foot visit many nice places."
1216,I’m only giving a one star because of the disgusting breakfast they offer their guests. We paid more than $500.00 dollars for the room no big deal location is great right on Ocean drive.  We were just shocked of the quality and type of breakfast they offer with the room very disappointed you get a better breakfast at a $70.00 hotel. I hope one of the managers see this review and works on offering their customer a better quality food or don’t offer a breakfast with the room. 
1217,Just returned from Vila Gale having booked it given the very good reviews. Starting with the room the balcony doors opened onto shabby houses with washing lines and rooftop dogs barking 24 hours a day. The wardrobe doors were broken and the drawers in the wardrobe had a wooden strip nailed across them so were unusable. Reception did offer to try and find another room but no joy. The beds were the hardest I have ever experienced and with the barking dogs sleep quality was poor. The reviews about the food were good to excellent so perhaps I am too fussy but the meals offered a small selection of bland repetitive food far below  4 star standard. Visited the A L Carte restaurant one evening and the food was poor Drinks were ok but just one cocktail available the other cocktails are…
1218,"I stayed here from Thursday 7/26 - 7/29 and on Friday night as a Caucasian couple male and female walked in front of me through security (Nyota) to the elevator they were not asked any questions. When I and my partner both African American women walked through Security Nyota immediately stopped talking to her co-worker and asked for our room key. I immediately pulled out our room key and asked why didn’t they ask the couple in front of us. Nyota states they showed their key, which was not the truth they had nothing in their hands except the males had a cellphone and never raised his hand. Nyota proceeded to tell lies and I asked to the the Manager when Clinton Benjamin walked over and immediately defended his staff when he was not present. I am a loyal Hilton Honors member and…"
1219,"Not the cheapest hotel you can find, but in general we had a really good stay there. Location is not in the city center, but it's near the beach and it's between 20 and 30 minutes away by bus from the different Barcelona's point of interests. The metro run all night on saturday, but if you want to stay in the city a bit late during the week, the bus/metro stop around midnight. So it's around 40-50minutes walk back to the hotel."
1220,We have been coming for 10 years and my parents longer. It's still lovely but the children's play area is very small and with 4 children to entertain it hasn't been invested in as any additional game facilities are from the closure of the classic savoy and not through any money having been spent. The concrete around the pool needs addressing as do some of the rugs which in the top foyer are ripped and a trip hazard. Feel a little like it just constantly wants your money rather than giving anything back to the client. Just take take take. Very sad.
1221,Stayed at Centro Vital during the recent ITB fair in Berlin as usual. The availability of the Gym and the swimming pool was a great bonus. Great value for money. Courteous service at front office and restaurant.
1222,"The hotel was clean, the wifi was speedy,location was excellent and staff were phenomenal. Special thanks to Franck for being so accommodating and helping us out with a number of recommendations. Will definitely be coming back"
1223,"The positives: We had a superior terrace room, room 708 and it was incredible. Having our own terrace was the best part, we had sun loungers and a table and chairs to sit in the sun and enjoy the incredible views, could even see the tops of the Sagrada. Try and get a room on the 7th floor with the view! - The sound-proofing was excellent, no noise at all from the street due to the double exterior door. - The room was cleaned to excellent standard every day and the bathroom items topped up daily. - The staff were friendly and helpful. - The buffet breakfast was really good. It wasn't included in our room price but was only 10 euro. - 15 min walk to Catalonia square - Because you're a distance from all the action, you're near the local restaurants that aren't heavily tourist…"
1224,Hotel is very nice. Pool area on the roof. Breakfast  was excelent. The street next to the hotel went quite on night time. Good thing for light sleepers. Some issues about the cleaning like we run out of toilet paper one day. All around positive expirience. 
1225,"Developed weird skin rash while in Chicago. Text several pictures to my dictor. I initially thought it was allergy, after reviewing the patterns and images, I was convinced it's bed bug bite  Hotel management: Room 2105. Please check the room to make sure the next guest will not suffer"
1227,"If you are a fellow American, you will NOT appreciate the front desk staff. They are unhelpful, downright unfriendly and speak little to no English. The location, however is good and central, which would be the only reason to pick it. The Turim Hotel is right next door and is a much better deal!."
1228,"The hotel is only 10-minutes walk from the Palais so it was very convenient. The room was nice and clean, people at the reception were all friendly and helpful.  Internet connection is pretty slow. "
1229,I stayed in one of the hotel’s new rooms. The comfort of the bed was average but ventilation/cooling in the room was bad and I had a bad night’s sleep. There was a small vertical window which doesn’t provide much ventilation - the air conditioning unit is located downstairs and is insufficient to cool the room upstairs - the air in room felt very stale and hot upstairs and I found it difficult to go to sleep. 
1230,"While this hotel looks luxurious, the common saying of its what on the inside that counts comes to play here. Not on the physical inside, the service on the inside. THE SERVICE HERE IS HORRIBLE. You will have to wait for everything, I mean everything. We had to wait 45 minutes just to have a luggage delivered to our room, and by then it was too late to change into our swimsuits and go swimming. And, as long as we are on the topic of swimming, all of the pools are in the shade anyway. The pools are on the north side of the large, 21 + floor building so the shadow of the building covers all of the pools and part of the beach. So, any chance of you getting any tan while sitting by the pool is about 0. I mean, what architect constructs a building like that! Also, the maid service is…"
1231,"The best place to stay with your family if you are planning your visit to Berlin with limited budget) thanks for such a nice service for all receptionists! guys, you are really good ☺️ My mom was excited to see all places you’ve recommend! The location is perfect. Everything is in walking distance.   Definitely will be back)"
1232,"The hotel is fantastic, and the staff is top-notch. The biggest issue with this hotel is the awful air conditioning system that doesn’t get lower than 20C/68F. The A/C in my bedroom is set at 18C/65F because I sleep very hot. If you have the same issue, you will struggle at this hotel to sleep. The hotel staff was kind enough to give me a fan, but it didn’t help much at all. They did send the technician to the room to check things, and everything was normal according to him. The hotel staff offered to move us, but we were told that all the other guest rooms could not get colder than 20C/68F since it is the lowest the thermostat will go. Mind you that the fan speed in the unit is also weak, with no difference between level 1 and 3.   The W Amsterdam must increase the capacity of…"
1233,"We frequently stay in lisbon. For over 150 euros per night, excluding breakfast, in november, this doesn't justify another try.  You decide if location is central enough. For Chiado or where you will want to eat, expect to need a taxi.  We arrived late and the check in was poor. Were required to pay immediately, as if we were going to run off in the morning.  Room was newish but devoid of any and all character. Felt like a holiday inn had been glitzed up. Industrial everything.   Doors were heavy, but provided no soundproofing.  Can't figure out why with all of the extras in the room, can't seem to justify an extra bar of soap.  "
1234,"We stayed in Kenton Palace for 7 nights as it was part of the package deal we bought with our flights to Buenos Aires. The only positive was the location, just few minutes from Plaza de Mayo and Puerto Madero. Otherwise the hotel left much to be desired. This is certainly not a 4 star hotel as they claimed to be. No tea bags in the room, big but very bare room, if you want to use gym or spa you need to pay extra. Room had very dim lights. The bed is uncomfortable with just two super firm pillows and no proper blanket - just some light bed cover. And when we asked reception for a blanket they just gave us another one of this. Everything about the hotel was like they tried to cut costs at the expense of the visitors comfort. Staff was also rather rude and have poor attitude…"
1235,"I had the luck of being apparently upgrated indeed I had such a terrible room. No plug to charge your phone near the bed. The lightning so bad, and the fact that I could not open the window because the shutters blocked the access. For the breakfast I prefer to be honest and let you know that it is very limited offer. I do not recommend this hotel. Sadly because from the website it looked nice."
1237,"Stayed at the Pullman over Christmas and was very disappointed to be treated like an inconvenience... Due to the fact the hotel had filled its Christmas events with guests not staying in the hotel, we felt like we had crashed someone else’s party. It was disappointing to see everyone loudly enjoying the Christmas brunch, and the hotel’s facilities while we had to go out and try to find something to do... Won’t be returning..."
1239,Stayed her with the wife for 5 nights. 3 on a conference and 2 sightseeing. Firstly as a conference centre this place is first class. Everything is huge and spacious and comfortable. Our meals at the conference were excellent if you consider how many they were catering for. As a normal guest apart from the crowded bar you would not know a conference was on. Positives: Large and very clean room. Not the most up to date but everything you need We had a bath which we prefer to a shower Quiet - no noisy nights Food good - we liked the Tapas Bar Great location - 15 minute walk from The Brandenburg Gate and The Reichstag S and U Bahn stop just minutes away     Excellent value Great staff and all round service  Negatives:  Pillows are very soft  The free Wifi in the room was unsecured…
1240,"Not fancy, but very functional hotel and very good location, for Born, Gothic Quarter, Barceloneta.  Friendly front desk, spacious clean rooms, breakfast is ok. Overall, very good, reasonable price, but nothing fancy."
1242,"The building is in industrial style, very modern and interesting. Rooms are spacious, newly furnished, clean and comfortable. The breakfast is perfect, hand made with fresh materials. On the other hand, the location is not ideal, as the main attractions are not very close on foot. However, there is a u-bahn station on the next corner. The receptionists should be a little bit more polite, willing to help and friendly."
1244,"The Hotel itself was immaculate, especially if you are on the 18th, 19th floor, which is club level. In the club lounge you can have breakfast as well, very calm very nice and you can use the business centre. A small conference room is also available up there.  Staff here is very helpful and competent.  Not sure though if I would consider it a 5 star hotel. I travel a lot in china and I've seen 4 star hotels that offer a similar standard for slightly less money. As rooms are in designed in shining white, the smokers room look a little worn out due to smoking. And I guess it is really difficult not to see that things you touch a lot (desk, handles, drawers) are heavily ""in use""..   A small tailor shop is located in the hotel if you need a suit/shirt/tie last minute. There is a…"
1245,"After checking in to the property, I went to my room, I lowered the AC since it was quite warm in the room and left for dinner.   When I returned two hours later, the room was still very warm.  I informed the front desk and they sent an engineer to inspect the room.   I had the room set for 18 Celsius but the temperature in the room was 23 Celsius and would not get colder (the engineer had a temp measurement gauge).  They offered me a new room which I inspected but found it to be even warmer and it also smelled damp and moldy.  I choose to stay in my original room which never really got to a comfortable temperature.  The WI-FI throughout the property and in my room was very inconsistent and prevented me from working due to limited signal strength and reliability.  I reported…"
1246,"This is our preferred hotel in Berlin. It has a private boutique feel even though it belongs to the intercontinental chain. It’s run smoothly, rooms are big, cleanliness is tops, service is too. Staff very professional and helpful."
1247,"This was my 2nd stay at this hotel for Business purpose. The hotel is good with friendly staff. Rooms are bigger than the normal rooms that one gets in Berlin. The breakfast has adequate options. The best point of this hotel is its location. At the backyard one can go to Savignyplatz which has a lot of options for dinner & drinks. On the other hand, the main street Ku damm is on the other side which makes it convenient to take the public transport.... Highly recommended one!!"
1248,"If you stayed in Paris before you know how the hotels usually are: old, very small and very expensive. At least with Ibis the PRICE was AMAZING. Still small, for sure, but not as many other hotels in this city. And so you can have an idea, what I spent for a full week there, I spent for 3 nights in Amsterdam. Bottom line is: the service and location are very good, and the price is unbelievable. I really recommend it. Only suggestion I have (but that's an issue with the Ibis brand and not this one specifically) is that there aren't mini fridges in any room."
1249,"We were in Rio for 6 nights over New Year's eve, so every hotel in town was jacking up their rates by 2-3 times their standard rates. Ipanema Inn was no different, we paid $1500USD (not including service charge) for those 6 nights. And to think that we paid $250 per night and got the room we got (I'd say in the US this room would cost $60 at the most), I can't really praise this place on its value. Don't get me wrong, everything worked, but the look and feel of the place just wasn't worth the money we paid. This is really a no-frill 2 star hotel room where the blankets were about as thin as the bedsheets and the room is not big enough to put a TV on a stand so they have to hang it from the ceiling.   The only thing it's got going for it though, is a brilliant location on Rua…"
1250,"Sunflower hostel is well-managed and super clean with a creative design and good people. they have a bar, with cheap beer and a decent breakfast to start your day (3 euros). Everything you might need is on a deposit system (3 euros each for a set of sheets, lock for your locker, towel, etc) but obviously you get it all back at the end. Our room was unfortunately quite hot at night and airflow wasn't great but the beds were comfortable and secure. The neighborhood is great, with loads to do and see. Overall we had a great time and would recommend and stay there again in the future."
1251,"The location is great, it's right off the pedestrian walkway of E. Nanjing Road and about 6 or 7 blocks from the bund. that's good. there is no club lounge here. what I hated about this hotel is the phoniness of the staff. The staff seemed to fawn over the hipster and millennial posers that strut around the lobby pretending like they are important while shooing away any other guests that they deem unacceptable. If you're middle aged or decide not to wear you best Vogue fashion outfits, most of your requests will be met with ""sorry, we can't accommodate that."" the same request by a hipster loser is ""right away, certainly."" Frankly, I found this to be disgusting. I felt I was shabbily treated here. It was my mistake booking my room here. Please, don't screw up like I did."
1253,"I booked this hotel to celebrate my husbands birthday on Sept 15th and our wedding anniversary on Sept 19th. We had stayed at this hotel in 2000 B&B and in 2012 HB. We were very keen to see the changes that had taken place with the refurbishment. Reception had been moved to the back wall facing the main doors. I was very disappointed to see that the beautiful floral arrangements has been replaced by modern ornaments on the desk top. Checked in quickly by a young lady, we went up to our room. We were very pleased to see we had been given a high floor which we had asked for. The room was very well appointed with good lighting and air con and more than enough sockets.The beds were like rocks! On request a duvet was supplied to sleep on. We had problems with the cooler/mini bar (not…"
1254,"Good located hotel close to Schipol Airport and close to the areas in Amsterdam West, especially the wood harbor. Nice recently refurbished rooms, with nice big beds, and good bathrooms. Only big problem is the noise from the hallway; everytime a guest in another room leaves or enters his room the doors slam shut with a huge bang that easily travels into your room - impossible not to wake up if some one on your site of the hotel leaves or enters his or her room when you are a sleep. Everything looks so nice, clean and new, and then you save on the doors to the rooms. Extremely customer friendly staff in the reception and restaurant. Breakfast buffet menu; good and above average buffet, very good selection of bread and cold cuts, but lacking a little in the warm buffet.…"
1255,"I stayed here for a week holiday with my partner. The plus is that it's a really good location that's only a 10-15 minute walk from the town, the fort area and many nice restaurants.  I'm not a football fan, so luckily the decor was actually subtler than it looks in the pictures. The rooms are set across one floor off a very long corridor. The room we had was comfortable and clean. The pool area is nice, and if you can get a sun lounger (not always possible) then a great place to spend the day sunbathing. Breakfast is mainly a buffet with a selection of hot food and cold continental breakfast items. It was one of the better breakfasts I have had at a hotel.  The drawbacks are the service is pretty poor. As other reviews have noted the hotel seems to employ very young people, who…"
1256,"After reading the reviews and looking at the location (famous Rua Augusta street), we were excited to stay at this hotel for three nights. Unfortunately overall it was a disappointment and the hotel did not meet our expectations. Here we go:  The on site parking is handy, but does not really require a valet service, because the car is put just some meters away in front of the hotel entrance. This means that the guys from the valet service have plenty of time to play on their smart phones, which they did all the time when we past. The check-in was okay, but slow. The best part was the room itself with a lot of glass, which means the room is bright. On the other side the balcony is a joke - it does not have even enough space to put chairs. The view is okay for one evening for…"
1258,"I would never stay at this Hilton again. Traveling once a week across the country and staying at Hilton properties it was extremely disappointing. My room rate jumped $125 the second night. When I called to inquire I was told by the manager that when booking online there is a small * at the bottom of the website that says room rates are subject to change. Because I accepted it, I owe the $125 more and he was not willing to drop the rate at all. Not to mention when I stepped out of the front door I was greeted by a weed smoker,crack smoker and lots of homeless people. Now I know why they charge so much to whom stays there- they probably don't ever stay again. Not recommended at all."
1259,"Park Hyatt,  I am pretty disappointed for one aspect of my stay at your hotel.  I did my check in on Thursday morning and I got my room around noon.   On Thursday night, I noticed 2 charges of over 819 dollars each in the card I used to do my check in. I went to the front desk to ask about it, but the person attending the front desk told me not to worry.   I explained to him that the charge was already done on my account even though I hadn’t check out yet and the amount of more than 1600 dollars was incorrect. He said that everything would be fine when I do the check out.  I went again on Friday morning to the front desk and I was told again that everything would be just fine.  I check out from the hotel on Saturday morning and was given a letter with the total charge of 612…"
1260,"The lobby is ok and always clean and the service is perfect. Unfortunately, the food is totally out of range. Soups come to the table cold (and it was a pumpkin soup, not a gaspacho), the raviolis were awful, melt down, cold and sticky. 1 big ravioli because the pasta was totally melt down or over cooked in the microwave.  I've tried rib eyes once and was also terrible, overcooked and cold. It seems that the kitchen is too busy always or very far and food can't arrive hot.  It deserves an urgent improvement. The exception is the dessert, all of them are good and delicious but who wants to go to a restaurant just for a dessert?"
1261,"Two years ago I stayed in the Gallery Home, this time in one of the dorms in the hostel. It's a very nice place, with good communal situations. The only problem for me were the mattresses (I tried two) - they definitely need replacement! Even the cheaper Ikea ones would do..."
1262,"I am a travel agent and was really looking forward to my stay at Eden Roc. I understand that Miami is very expensive and that the hotels inflate pricing on things but I was very disappointed to see that there were no prices on anything in the minibar at all. I was shocked to see all the various taxes and the worst yet- an auto-gratuity on each item. Why should I tip on a minibar item? You already charge a resort fee.   I was also unaware of the 20% auto-gratuity on the restaurant bill and was almost taken for a double gratuity. The waiter never brought the check. I was arguing to pay the check over my husband paying it so I told the waiter to charge it to the room. We waited about 10 minutes for him to come with the check and he did not. When I asked him, he said it's all good.…"
1263,"Cannot recommend this place hugely enough. My girlfriend and I were treated amazing as soon as we walked in the door and we had an unbelievable experience. The rooms were perfectly clean and the showers are awesome. I really cannot recommended this place highly enough, the location, the staff, it's amazing."
1264,"We've never visited Germany before and we chose this hotel because it was close to the Christmas markets which was the purpose of our visit. So glad we did because it exceeded our expectations. Its modern, stylish and comfortable with friendly staff on hand 24 hours a day. The room was very clean and well laid out. All the essentials like tea/coffee making facilities and a safe in the room were provided plus plenty of sockets. If we had a minus it would be the restaurant menu which was a little limited on food choices. Very easy to get to the hotel on the train from the airport. Excellent base for exploring the surrounding area."
1265,"Will be fair - Overall appearance is good, very clean, bathroom immaculate, found bed to be very comfortable and room in the inner yard building rather quiet. But then.... (I don't normally complain if service and communication is pleasant.) Me and my friend (two girls) were given a double bed and reception didn't bother to ask whether that is what we'd want (on the second day they did split it). First day went for breakfast late-ish so most food was lukewarm. Third day sausages were just as lukewarm at 8.30, no heating been put under the trays. Scrambled eggs looked greenish and had a funny not fresh smell. Never seen anywhere pickled herring for breakfast, also green peas, fresh paprika and pickled cucumbers but that's more of an oddity than a fault as the normal breakfast…"
1266,"Firstly, a taxi ride from the airport to the hotel will cost 55 EUROs so would highly suggest researching the metro system. We used the Metro to get back and it's a lot easier and only cost 10 EUROs a one-way ticket.  The hotel is neatly tucked away on a small one way street conveniently located by Paris Saint-Lazare metro/railway station which has an amenity of shops. There are a few hotels along this road and the Phileas is easily recognised by its candy cane style pinstriped lobby. Upon arrival the receptionist was pleasant, had a very good grasp of Englsih and allowed us to store our baggage as the room wasn't ready while we went exploring. We covered 55,000 steps over the 3 days and found walking to major attractions such as: Notre Dame, Sacre C'oeur, Moulin Rouge,…"
1267,"As a solo female traveller on my first hostel experience I was a little nervous, but the place is secure, the staff friendly. The beds were very comfy and linen provided. Modern bathroom and nice bar area downstairs. Plug was right next to my bed top bunk.  You can hear the s-Bahn but that's to be expected as it's right next to it, so very easy access to transport.  "
1270," A legend palace but a very disappointing welcome. The staff was cold and distant. We never feeled really good at this hôtel. The hotel would also be renovated to be more modern. To finish, if I return to Madeira, I will not return to this hotel."
1271,"Travellers should be aware that  the name Aqua Luxury Suites does not apply to all rooms. Assuming we had booked a luxury suite, we were disappointed to be shown to an extremely small and cramped room, where we struggled to move around the bed, which took up most of the space. There was very limited storage, no drawers, and a short wardrobe, unsuitable for hanging dresses. There was  no room for even a single chair and our luggage  was stored during our stay, since  keeping it in room would have added to our discomfort. The bathroom was also small  with a corroded shower head which soaked  the floor after every use. We asked to be moved but the only option offered  was to move daily, which we chose not to do, although in hindsight we should have done. Breakfast is brought to…"
1272,"While I did not expect a 5 star hotel for the price, I did expect it to be clean.  Our family stayed one night, two suites.  The carpeting was wet in one of our rooms.  Our blanket was so old the polyester in it was sticky.  Any Motel 6 is better than this hotel.  While the AC units work, they are noisy.  Paul at the front desk was rude. The breakfast offered is merely two types of cereal and toast with juice or milk.  Not kid friendly cereal.  I travel on business some 70 nights a year, I have never once written a bad review.  This place is disgusting, pay more and find another hotel.  I did send an email to the Hotel Manager and it has been a week, without a reply."
1273,"I didn't like the hotel at all, unfortunately the rooms weren't clean, the location isn't siutable for us. The breakfast room wasn't nice to start the day. I prefer to stay Paulista area for sure.I won't stay again for sure."
1274,"From the moment you step foot into the lobby of this hotel you can feel its opulence which extends to all corners of this grand hotel. Located on the Croisette you are across the road from the main strip of beaches in Cannes and very central to all that Cannes has to offer. The suites are absolutely gorgeous combining luxury and sophistication with classical French character. The staff were very helpful and eager to please, adding to the pleasure and charm the Hotel Barriere has to offer. The breakfast had so mcuh offer with a large selection of breads and cheeses to die for, amongst many other choices to please all tastes. The prices in the restaurant and bar are quite steep, but to be expected in such a venue. Overall, if you're visiting Cannes and wish to treat yourself, this hotel is a great choice.…"
1275,"We visited Barcelona for New Years,first time and I cannot fault these apartments! We booked the penthouse ideal for 4.   Fantastic location, loved exploring and beautiful restaurants and bars a stones throw. The apartment was modern and clean we did not however have the room cleaned which was requested we are unsure why?otherwise great possibly even 5 star! The reception guys were great too, very helpful with any requests we wanted to book a massage near by which they assisted with this (thank you once again) very peaceful no inside noise or inside.  Overall fantastic stay! Only comment would be to supply tea/coffee condiments :-) "
1277,"I have never written a review before, but waking up with bed bug bites all over my body is just unacceptable.  My husband and I have experienced bed bug bites in all the kimptons we stayed during our multi-city trip.  Be aware & stay away from all kimpton hotels, unless, you would like to welcome red spots on your bodys every morning!"
1278,"I visited the Royal Savoy in June 2017. Check-in was super quick and Funchal is a stunning place to visit I would definitely recommend. The hotel was decent, but for the price we paid I would have expected a little more luxury. The rooms were clean but very outdated (although I believe a whole new Royal Savoy is in creation?) The facilities were rather basic and the hotel itself seems to attract a lot more families and young children that I expected. The food however was incredible, we booked for an evening dinner, despite being expensive, the food was exquisite and we had lunch or dinner at the hotel daily without fail. Overall, staff, food and location fantastic... but needs an update!"
1279,"This is our fifth New Year at the Riu Palace Madeira but this year things seem to have deteriorated somewhat. The hotel was as good as ever, the staff excellent as always, but the restaurant has gone downhill both in terms of its selection and quality of food offered; for the first time we had to send back food selections that were not properly cooked including turkey that was raw in the middle and scrambled eggs that were uncooked under the surface of the serving dish. Hopefully the hotel will review this and offer some improvement in this regard. Otherwise we had a great time again."
1280,"Wouldn’t stay here the deluxe rooms are rough need a good clean only 1 bedside cabinet very basic and paint needs a refresh only stayed 1 night thank goodness ,staff were pretty friendly and helpful but that was it after the hotel in Hoi an this was a shocker"
1281,"We rented the basic one bedroom apartment and it was a barely adequate. It was much like the pictures advertised, except that it did not have a table for eating (ate at the bar instead); there was no window in the bedroom; and (we hadn't noticed) there were no drawers in which to put your clothes, only one wardrobe. Although we were required to wait until 2 pm to take possession of the apartment and it was clean at that time, it did not have bath linens and had only one small bar of soap. The management was convinced that these items were present so it took a couple of trips to the lobby (no phone in the apartment) to get them. The apartment had two windows in the living area, but you could not use them to see outside. The kitchen was completely furnished(including a coffee…"
1283,We were told on our arrival that we could not have our room until 2pm.  Off we went to have lunch - no problem.  When we went back at 2pm we were told that they had overbooked and we wouldn't be allocated our room until the next day.  They gave us one of their Time Share suites which was nice but the problem was that we couldn't unpack and settle in.  The next day they moved us and again the room was nice but as it was a special anniversary for us on that day it was rather spoilt.  We were not the only ones this happened to - at least 4 other couples that we know of.  NOT GOOD. The hotel and staff were very nice but we felt that the evening dinner could have been better.
1284,"Hotel is located in the Lido of all hotels in Funchal. 10 min to the center by taxi (8 eur) or the free shuttle from the hotel. Very correct service from the staff on all aspects. Well-appointed rooms, but need an upgrade. The gentlemen are asked to wear long trousers during the evening, why do men walk around with shorts? Half board = service at the table or on other days is the buffet. Breakfast is sufficient, tasty and wide choice The food at dinner is not as it should be for this type of hotel. Too limited a supply. Knowledge of cooking methods: Blue, saignant, medium, well done is completely wrong. The sauce has a bad taste and does not belong to steak at all. Exterior of the hotel also needs some refurbishment work Inside everything is well and cleanly finished. Both the…"
1285,"Hotel is very close to the train station, and its about 6 minute from the Main station (1 stop). Hotel is not so clean :/ but the rooms are clean, so that is ok. We didnt take a breakfast. Staff in hotel is very friendly people."
1286,"After spending over $500 a night, this place charges $4.81 to bring boiling water to the room so I can make baby formula. Tacky. When you order food by the pool, it’s absolutely disgusting and comes cold in plastic takeaway containers. "
1287,"During out three days stay, they totally ""forgot"" to clean our room. Not a nice surprise to get tired back from tour and find the room totally undone.   After requesting the cleanup and towels, somebody came in few minutes to make the room up.   Finally when we got ""clean"" towels, one was totally stained and disgusting .  Stupid sign in room telling ""here is your first cups of coffee, if you need more come downstairs to buy more"". I found it insulting for visitors that stay several nights."
1288,Let me start by saying that this hostel is not for everyone. It was not at all what I expected and nothing at all like the positive reviews stated. I should have read more reviews about the hostel. Many reviews touted that this was a great social hostel.  .  The check-in process is what gave me a bad first impression of the staff. The worker was very lackadaisical. I was there early having just left another hostel and waited a couple hours because they clean from 10:30 to whenever. Okay. The problem is the receptionist never made an effort to see that the room was ready. Three people that came in after me were shown there rooms first. I basically had to ask and follow behind to get my bed.When I finally got to the bed the cleanliness was questionable.From the next room I heard…
1290,"I don't have any complaints about the hotel itself, it was an average clean hotel. However, the location is awful. It is very far from Amsterdam Centraal, if you wanted to get there you have to take a shuttle bus to the other Bastion hotel, then a shuttle bus to the train station and then a train to Centraal, totalling to about an hour journey. Coming home late is a no go unless you are willing to pay for a cab, as the shuttle bus stops at 10pm (so early :/ ). On arrival we waited to check in for 3 hours only to find out we were at the wrong Bastian hotel, so double check which one you are staying it. It is in a quiet secluded area with nothing to do."
1291,"Situated near peripherique but very close to the metro station. It is a nice, clean, and  the room is spacious , have a good, fresh interior design, with 2 TV in a classic doubleroom. also have a Nespresso cafe maschine with caps.  Many thanks to Aristide, was very kind and helpful to checkin.  we will definitely come here again. "
1292,"I would Highly recommend this hotel very affordable ,we have never had breakfast as we like to have this on the shore front , staff very helpful and a great location just one street from marina where I was working , tastefully decorated rooms , en suite quite small but very good "
1293,"Where do I begin... Me and my family have stayed at Starwood Hotels all over the country. We've never had a bad thing to say about them... Until now. Let's start at the beginning: 1. The check-in - delayed. We arrived 10 minutes before official check-in. It didn't really surprise me that the room wasn't ready. We were technically early after all. I was asked for my phone number to call when it becomes available but we've decided to wait in the lobby anyway. After 40 minutes my wife, a bit aggravated by then, decided to inquire about the room. To her surprise the room was already prepared for us. Yet, nobody bothered to call me or even walk over to us. We were sitting 15 feet away from the front desk the whole time!! 2. The room - 24th floor - preferred guest floor. Lake view.…"
1294,"For a 5 star Radisson hotel I expected a lot better than this. Compare this with f.ex Shangri-La, and you have two different worlds.  Most of the staff doesnt speak or understand English, so whatever you wonder you have to figure out yourself.  The breakfast selection is targeting Chinese guests so for western preferences the breakfast is really not good.   The hotel manager spoke good English and was very helpful.   Rooms are ok. Bed very comfortable. Bathroom ok, even though the shower didnt exactly look new or clean."
1295,"Unfortunately the hotel is on a very steep slope so not recommended for those with mobility problems. The hotel was built 20 years ago and it shows -  apart from the lobby the hotel needed a total refurbishment.plenty of decay and old furniture No air conditiioning The food was limited and not the best. On a positive note the hotel is in a great location is for amenities. There is sufficient for sport minded individuals, a basic gym, indoor and outdoor swimming pool, small sauna and tennis court. What stood out the most is the staff based at the hotel who work tirelessly to ensure that guests have a good stay."
1296,"Let me start by saying I am someone who provides a services and I understand how much terrible reviews can impact a business. This is the first time I’ve ever written a terrible review. We never actually stayed at the villa Florence, but it’s been such a stressful 24 hours. We are traveling to San Francisco nov 20-23, we found this hotel and booked for nov 20-23 directly from the hotel’s website (not a third party), upon getting our booking receipt the dates on our receipt said nov 19-22, NOT dates we typed in. We immediately called upon seeing this error and the person on staff Sunday night told us we had to speak to the manager Monday morning. Fast forward to today (Monday), my boyfriend calls to get this all situated, a female representative answered the phone changed our…"
1298,"Ok, none of the people that wrote previous reviews must have stayed on the side of the hotel that is above the nightclub!  We were placed on the 8th floor with no idea there was a nightclub below us until 1030 pm when the pounding rave music started and lasted until 2 am!  We called the front desk to see if we could be moved seeing that we had our one year old daughter with us that needed sleep...we were told that they overbooked the hotel and nothing was available, however they could send some earplugs up!  Seriously?  I have never had a stay like this in a Marriott hotel before...the worst experience ever.  Did I forget to mention the air conditioning was broken and we had to have the maintenance man come up at 945 pm to fix it?  Worst stay...ever.  Did I also forget to…"
1299,We stayed in this hotel to celebrate our one year anniversary. This hotel did not disappoint at all! The staff were super friendly and room was very comfortable and clean! We loved the fact the hotel manager was always checking up on us to make sure we're comfortable! 
1300,My wife and I went there in March 14. The rooms were nice and there was a nice fruit basket. Pool water colour was a bit off following day. After we had swam found out later that  pool pump was broken and they had said nothing. Only then did they close the pool. My wife suddenly got the worse ear infection and on arrival back to HANOI had to rush her to hospital and spent a fortune on medical bills. Service at breakfast was good but service at pool bar which was never open and beach bar was poor . You had to go and order your own drinks as staff stood around chatting. For a hotel that has only been open for a year and a half it was poor to say the least. I needed check in on line for a flight when I went to the business center they told me all the computers were broken and to…
1301,"This was a beautiful hotel in a wonderful location.  I heartily recommend it with one caveat. My only problem was that the wifi went out one morning and I had to leave the hotel to find a cafe in which to work. On Christmas Eve. Most hotels would've found some way to compensate a guest for this massive inconvenience (free breakfast or mini bar or something). These guys didn't seem to think that not having wifi (they have a computer in the room but I could not use this for my work) was a huge deal. In 2016, it is. "
1302,Had a great week long stay here in May this year.   The staff were lovely and very helpful.  The location was absolutely perfect as everything was in walking location of the hotel but still peaceful and quiet! We heard no noise what so ever and slept really well every night.  There is a Netto directly over the road and a Lidl (which is better) just 1 minute walk. The hotel reception has an ice machine and  cups  so you can get a drink from the shop and enjoy it cold with ice in your room.   Breakfast was a very generous continental offering and was all good quality. Want to keen on the coffee though not sure why.   Rooms were cleaned daily and to a good standard.  My only negative was that the room was so small for a family room it was really hard to get ready and not be under…
1303,"Not really a 5-star hotel (you usually have to dock a star with Portuguese ratings).  It's smaller than the photos lead you to believe; nice views but facilities are limited; tries too hard to be a 5-star, with an overpriced restaurant and bar (the measures were stingy compared to other places in Portugal), but the location is great.   Breakfast staff were chatty and pleasant, but there seemed to be too many of them - do they really need someone to press the lift button for you ??  We weren't advised about the building work next door, so the excessive noise from 8 till late came as an unwelcome surprise."
1304,"Currently staying in one of the residences which borders an empty plot of land that turns into a local beach party at night. It’s 5am and the music has started up again. Calling down to the staff they just say they will send security to go check but it doesn’t help. It’s a shame bc the grounds (pool/beach) are nice. The food is also poor, even the Vietnamese. Room could be cleaned better, particularly the rugs look like they haven’t ever been cleaned. "
1305,"Let me first preface that I rarely (if ever) leave reviews. I checked in 4 hours ago and I'm already leaving a scathing review (I can't believe I'm being this person). My partner and I are actually from Chicago and we are here at The Rafaello for 2 days as a staycation for our 7 year anniversary and his birthday.  Upon arrival check in went fine. Although we did hear about the elevator situation from prior reviews, overall it didn't bother us. When we got to our room my first reaction was it looked NOTHING like the photo in the Hotels.com booking page. This room is legit 20'x20'. Now, if I had known that prior I wouldn't have been as upset or would have chosen another room. After all, we aren't some tourists that will be exploring the city. We wanted a nice room to crash and…"
1306,"Run down and needs a facelift. Cockroaches in room, curtains not closeable, towels 'old', linen 'old', furniture 'old' and worn out - stay away. Staff were friendly - I did not complain as most of the things that went wrong would be the same In the next room. "
1309,"Stayed in this lovely hotel for a 5 day break. Lovely friendly staff, clean rooms and super comfy beds. The location is ideal close to llacuna metro station and poblenou is a lovely area closeby with bars and restaurants. Thanks for a lovely break."
1311,This place is such a shame. The rooms are generally charming with nice grounds although looking somewhat run down in areas. The location is great. After that it is all down hill. We had three rooms across the resort with all of us emailing the hotel months out from our stay about Christmas activities and booking etc. we got no response. Once we got there we quickly realised that the limited food options on the resort were all booked out fully. Mainly to non hotel guests it seems. At one point it was 2pm pm Christmas Eve and we were unable to get lunch in the resort. We were directed by one staff member to hire a car and go to foodland. On Christmas Day with no options for food the room service was closed. Fortunately we ended up going to foodland the day before and stocked up on…
1312,"The hotel is located in Moabit, a pretty central part of Berlin. It is within a building which served as a fabric for ""Adress sign production machines"" ( in german a pretty awesome word)... even though it's located at a huge junction, the rooms are very quiet due to good isolation. The place is spotless clean, rooms and bathrooms spacious and fully equipped. Wifi is free. The hotel serves mainly- that's my guess- as a business hotel, which means it's empty at weekends. Got the double room for 65 Euro, great bargain. Wellness area around (didn't check it out). It is close to Berlin Tegel Airport, from where I had to fly out the next morning- 10 minutes by taxi and highly recommended for this purpose. Also the city center, Potsdamer Platz etc is close. Will stay there again if I…"
1313,"After traveling around for 2 weeks in Hawaii at a handful of other hotels we were not pleased to have to finish our trip at this hotel.   Our room was two double beds despite us requesting a king sized bed. The room was super outdated. When you turn the water on all the way it was way too powerful and splashed everywhere. This happened multiple times since we were used to just turning a tap on and not having to be worried about this. You had to step up into the shower with me facing the shower head (being 6' 0""). Our room was also positioned on the same floor as the conference center which means that it was very load each morning as people are waiting outside our room waiting to check into the conference. Not their fault, but just poor design on the hotel.  The valet service is…"
1314,An unfortunately bad choice of hotel. Hotel never had booking despite having received the funds. Staff completely unhelpful. I will never return to this hotel. It is a reasonable area but hotel lacks finesse. We stayed at the hotel for 2 nights previously and even then was not impressed by hotel staff and hospitality.
1315,This hotel is one of the nicest we’ve stayed in. Front desk staff were pleasant and helpful. Room was immaculate. We appreciated the complimentary water which was restocked each day. The staff really make this hotel what it is. Great location within walking distance to most major attractions in Paris. Would love to return to Paris and Le Marianne! 
1316,"The historic building was nice even the room was on the very small side. For our 2 nights stay we requested a twin bedroom at booking time and this was not provided. We could have it for the second night - after we showed our discontent - but it was not worth it the move as we left very early due to early morning flight. We were told that there are only 4 twin rooms out of about 28 in total so I wonder why we are able to choose the twin option when there is almost no chance to get it? We were told that they did not even get our twin room request from Expedia! There was no magnifying mirror in the bathroom even in all hotel commercials this is shown as a bathroom fixture. Slippers were provided but you had to ask reception for bathrobes. However, the people at the reception were…"
1317,I stayed here for a single night. The location of this hotel is good within easy walking distance of bus stop and train station. Also the night clubs like Laboratory and Barghain are within walking distance. The check in and check out was fast and the staffs were very friendly and helpful. The room was big and clean with all the essential amenities including tea maker and free wifi. The only thing that I didn't like is that the common area that is leading to the room was always filled with housekeeping carts with the brooms and garbage. It made me feel like I was stepping inside a garbage station. They should change it.
1318,"It was our first stay at Maple Hotel, the pictures on the Internet looked really great so we were looking forward to stay at this hotel. At our arrival we got a friendly welcome from the reception. The check in was fast. We know that on the internet you only see the best picture of the hotel/the best looking rooms... but there was no picture or any text describing our room. The room was ok, all was clean and modern but the view... only thing you see was a wall directly in front of the window. Cause we did not appreciate that we ask at the reception if they got better rooms with other view like the pictures we were told that we payed for that and can’t get another room. We were really disappointed about that, maybe proposing another room for a higher price would be a good option next time. But no option was proposed from the front desk team, the staff did not care if we were satisfied with the room or not. We see on the internet that they had other rooms for this period, finding an alternative (even if we have to pay more!) would have been appropriate. The pool was very nice, you got a stunning view from the pool/bar. Too bad that the bar is closing at 22pm it would be a really nice place to drink some cocktail. Breakfast buffet was ok. Also the location from the hotel wich is like 2 min from the beach.  For us it was the last time at this hotel.  Last but not least the belt boy was really nice to us and helped us carrying our luggage.  We hope that our “critics points” would be take for advice to make the stay of your next guest better than ours.…"
1319,This is a comfortable hotel in a fine building with classic architecture.  My room was a bit small but had all the requisites for a business hotel.  The breakfast buffet is excellent and generous in quality and variety.  Service at reception and in the restaurant and lobby café is very professional.
1320,"Small rooms, old decor, bathroom fittings just too dated . No flow in water . No free wifi, its just the name but didnt kept standards. Doors i rooms so thin just like any 2 star hotel .Opp to interconti thrs purple mountain much more better. Hv stayed there many times .   Better decor better rooms all better"
1321,"Just returned from Funchal & Four Views Baia. The hotel is very clean and well run, Reception staff were very friendly.   We had a room on the 3rd floor with a sea view which we did not request but was lovely, the room was equipped for disabled people but the balcony was so small I don't think a wheelchair would have got out onto it. I feel the room would have been best used for disabled people and not able bodied. As the room was above reception we managed to pick up WIFI. The BIG down side was the Zoomba class twice a week right outside our balcony NOT GOOD.  Small tip we only got 1 key card for our room and as it was a sea view we got the sun all day which made it very hot, I used my Tesco card in the slot so we could keep air con on all day.  The pool is nice but small,…"
1322,"2 nights here and opted for a budget hotel (€45 per night).  The rooms are quite small, but have all the standard facilities.  Very helpful staff.  Clean.  Free Wifi.  I did not have breakfast here, but there is a great coffee shop 2 doors away that serves excellent breakfast.  Location wise, this is great.  Airport bus and UBahn are both 2 minutes walk.  Huge variety of shops, restaurants and bars within 500 metres.  If you want a small and basic but well maintained hotel with friendly staff at very affordable prices in a great location, then you cant go wrong!"
1323,"We staied in a recently renewed villa. Comfortable and clean rooms nicely furnished and quite. We had croissant, baguette, ham and cheese for breakfast, served in a cosy room (there is learther couch in front of a fire place). The place is 10 minutes walk from the beach and from the train station, 15 minutes from the oldest part of Cannes. It offers parking for the car as well. Ah, don't want to forget to mention the owner: very kind person, always there to help."
1325,"Understaffed, pretentious and very expensive. The décor of the hotel is overly masculine with limited space in bedrooms.  There were no TV guides or channel line up list to assist guest.  Lighting of public rooms was very poor."
1326,After a long travel we checked in here at about 5 pm and they do not have their rooms ready at that time WHAT A HOTEL????? Then they tell us to wait 10 minutes and takes around an hour to give us a room and as we booked business room it was not satisfactory.Room was ok bathroom was terrible with very slow water pressures not satisfied with front desk staff. Club lounge was good but in room dining services was not. Staff don't know how to make guests satisfied.
1327,"This place is very pretty, and we loved the room on the afternoon of check-in. We usually ask for something other than a ground level floor, but didn't insist on it due to the rate we received.   That's where we were mistaken. The footfalls through our ceiling felt like our upstairs neighbors were hosting a Zumba class in combat boots.  We could feel it in the walls. I mean, how much walking around do you do in a hotel room? And voices of people out in the breezeway sounded like they were in our room, too.   The rooms are esthetically pleasing, and the view is great. It is clean and well kept.  The concept of a ground floor room with a patio is nice, but honestly it's quieter outside than in.   I can't say I recommend this place, unless you insist on a floor without upstairs…"
1328,"Love Berlin fantastic location close to the river, transport and all attractions, friendly helpful staff, clean and comfortable spacious room. Want more could you ask for this is a great place to stay "
1329,"How is this a 4 star hotel?  I stayed here for 3 nights and I would not recommend it to anyone.  Honestly - there are so many hotels available in Chicago I'm sure you can do better for the same amount of $.  First, the person who checked us in was rude when we asked if there were any rooms with 2 beds available (they are obviously at a premium).  In addition to our room being 'cozy' (very small) - it was on the 2nd floor so we heard not only the street/construction noise but also the music from the bar below.  I have bruises on my knees from banging into the corners of the bed.   Not a great experience."
1330,"We stayed 2 nights at the Mui Ne Bliss hotel. The staff at reception were amazing! Helped us book a tour and answered our questions. However, even if it’s not their fault, driver arrived 30 minutes late for the tour so not fun to get up at 4am and just wait.  1st night, our room was great with an awesome balcony which made us decide to stay for a second night. Since we booked last minute, they moved us in a room where the air conditioning was not working :(  the staff at the restaurant were not nice, food was just ok...Bar at night was terrible and it was so hard to get service as the staff looked more busy partying with the guest than taking care of us.  Hotel is up a hill though so be ready to go up and down.  However, location is great. Close to the beach but I would maybe…"
1331,"This was our first visit to Pestana Bay and our first experience of all inclusive!! I don’t think we will do it again. We found the food to be unimaginative and repetitive , as was the presentation. Many of the hot dishes being served in the evening , appeared in a salad for the following days lunch. It could be chaotic at meal times with tables uncleared and few staff to help. They were however very helpful and friendly . The pool area was lovely ,not sure what it would be like in the height of the season!, There were wonderful views,  but we didn’t expect to have to pay for umbrellas, nor were we anticipating the JCB digger to be shifting pebbles for several hours which was pretty noisy, and difficult to relax .The beach itself was not so easy to get on to if elderly.  The…"
1332,"If I return in Cannes I will return there. Thank's for Aurelliene. Very kindly and lovely the staff. We relax very much. The main restaurants, bars, shops are very close to the hotel. It is a new one hotel restore this year."
1333,"Hotel Real Palacio is in a good location in Lisbon, close to the park and easy walking distance to the water.  The rooms are dated and musty.  The front desk and housekeeping are fairly indifferent to the guests.  The breakfast is in  the basement in a loud room without windows and so-so food.  The coffee is from a machine. The restaurant, however, has a  great staff and the food is quite good. In all, we would recommend finding another hotel in the area."
1334,Three nights in this place in a corner suite for our first visit to Paris. Wonderful! Extremely comfortable. Friendly staff. Magical lift! Well worth it 5-star status. We will never forget it. Thank you to everyone who made our stay so memorable. It was a a pity we had to venture out and explore Paris and this hotel is well placed to explore all the famous sites! If you ever have the chance then please visit this hotel. We ate in the hotel once and can also recommend the restaurant.
1335,"The ""Hotel Adèle & Jules"" is a great Hotel in Paris to stay in. The hotel is a little bit far from the attractions but it is located in a safe and nice place. The breakfast is great and the rooms are too. I definitely recommend this hotel to tourists in Paris."
1336,"Booked twin bed room with my colleague, but suprised to know that room bathroom have no locking system from inside. No latch.. Very uncomfortable with colleague to stay at such...twin bed is not romantic room.  2. Bell boy services pathetic. They mishandled our blazers and left them on floor after xray.   3. Room service is very slow.  "
1339,"Thanks to the entire staff, the front desk, breakfast server, room cleaning staff!!!  Very helpful with everything we needed! And friendly!!!  Felt like we stayed with long time friends especially Samba!  When we return to Paris this is where we’ll stay again and again and again!"
1340,"I found this hotel on internet after many days of careful search.  Finally, I realized that all options came together: location and close metro station, just 5-7 min. to walk, reliable, nice and beautiful neighborhood and if you wish to go further to Marais, there are an endless shopping's,food stores, bakeries, etc. Hotel is very clean, staff is absolutely friendly, answering any questions and guiding you through the city. Special Thanks to Cyril who was the most helpful person in concierge service.  Room was little bit smaller than I expected, but quite enough for two people, bathroom nice, clean and fully equipped.  Rate is good comparing with many other facilities, considering the full breakfast buffet with really good food.  The nick name of this hotel is Gallery for the…"
1341,I had the temperature in my room up to 75 degrees. I froze all night due to drafty windows.  Bathrooms are very small with no water pressure in shower.  The staff could have cared less about you.  Way over priced.
1342,"No way this is a 4 star hotel by U.S. standards. It is old and run down (it looks like nothing but the pool has been updated since 1975). The pool is excellent. It is large with plenty of chairs and it is quiet. The buildings however need fresh paint, carpeting, update furniture, and new elevators (one made a noise that sounded like a torture chamber. It is also like a maze getting around the buildings. The beds were the most uncomfortable things I've ever slept in (and I lived in 3rd world countries for a while). We also have platinum status and despite upgrades being available this location refused to give them (we had 2 rooms). This property also didn't give free breakfast or any kind of welcome gift like all other properties do for platinum members. We were not granted a…"
1343,"I stayed here for a business meeting and it was just average.  Several things in my room required maintenance and there was a strong mold/mildew smell off and on.  No coffee/tea/kettle in the room as is generally available.  Just did not seem to be the ""5 star"" place it is purported to be.  "
1344,"I chose this hotel among recommendations from the Quadriga organisation in the same block, where I attended a professional workshop.  The hotel is certainly up to the international standard, and is priced fairly.  All the staff was friendly and helpful.  The room was very spacious and comfortable.  I loved the rocking chair.  The location is quite close to Unter Den Linden, St. Hedwig's Church, Uni Humboldt, etc."
1345,All staff we encountered were very helpful and professional so no issues there. Breakfast was excellent. However for the price of this hotel the rooms are small and basic and the bathroom more so.  There is no room in the bathroom for toiletries. We paid extra for an avenue view but our third floor room was a view of the tops of trees...no avenue could be seen.  We had escaped for a three night break for some much needed rest...impossible with the noise the cleaning staff made vacuuming the corridors very early and knocking on doors shouting housekeeping at 7-8am. No chance of catching up on any sleep and very irritating. The Sky Bar has fabulous views from the roof but 2 Gins were €30. Bit of a walk to find a decent restaurant. Lisbon is beautiful but for the money this hotel…
1346,"The Czar is a good hotel if you want an unpretentious reasonably priced clean hotel with good service and is well placed for access to the city centre. Our room, 4002, faced the back of the hotel and was wonderfully quiet. The reception, bar and dining areas are attractive and well placed. We were warmly greeted at reception when we arrived and were given all the information we needed. Our bedroom was of a good size with a large shower room where everything worked well. There was a TV, room safe and a small cooler that was useful to us. The bed was comfortable. Otherwise the room was sparsely furnished and some of the carpet and surfaces were a little worn but this was of no consequence. There were no coffee or tea making facilities in the room. Nearby are two metro stops on the…"
1347,"Good location, poor service from reception staff, room smelt of smoke despite it being a non smoking room. Foyer under reconstruction, only one lift available. No direct access to car park.  Had to go onto street, through next building, into back alley and then walk up the ramps to required level.  No lift."
1348,"I initially booked three nights at the hotel at the government rate of 267.00, but my company changed my plans several days before arriving to the hotel. I called the hotel and they wouldn’t change my reservation for the same price even though they are a Guaranteed Fed rate hotel and under contract with the government. When I arrived, I told them I would only be staying one night. The front desk said they would charge me a full nights stay for canceling at the last minute. The hotel is under contract with my company and we have a 6: pm cancellation policy and I was in the hotel standing at the front desk st 3:00 pm.  I had to make numerous phone calls back to my travel agency who in turn called the hotel. My travel agency spoke to the manager, Lori Ann who said she would…"
1349,"Mr. Satish at the front desk first sent us to a shady property just behind Travelodge, which had warning signs of cancer hazard all over the place. The place looked really filthy and did not have any Travelodge signs. The entry was through a back door garage and the place smelled real bad. I am 100% certain this was not a Travelodge property. When confronted, he immediately moved us to the Travelodge property in front. We got a room on the third floor. The room smelled of damp, but was much better than the shady property he first sent us to. The toilet flush did not work. When I reported the same, all Mr. Satish did is send a plunger. We booked the room for 4 adults and we had to use the plunger everytime someone used the toilet. This is the worst hotel experience we had ever.…"
1351,"This was my fourth stay at the hotel and it was as charming as ever! The St. Germain neighborhood is so charming and worth discovering. The hotel is very cozy, with friendly staff and clean rooms. I love the help-yourself bar all afternoon long and the complimentary breakfast. Will go back again!"
1352,"My partner and I have recently returned from a week spent at The Riu Palace in Madeira. This was a last minute deal founded on First Choice website, but flight, transfer and hotel were all operated by Tui.   LOCATION: The location of the Riu Palace is not great, the large building is located right at the bottom of the hill and from down there everything is (very) uphill. However, the journey from the airport only takes 10 minutes and the hotel provides free buses to and from the capital Funchal. A short, but not particularly well maintained promenade separate the (stony) beach from the hotel.   FOOD: The quality of food at the riu palace is very good. A large buffet is laid out for breakfast and dinner and a smaller one (mostly salads) for lunch. The food is varied and the range…"
1353,"I arrived Wednesday morning. At check in, my card declined and I had to spend a bit of time on the phone with my bank getting fraud alerts taken care of. After resolving the issue, I tried again, charge was approved, and I was issued a key.  The following morning, I left for the day with my family who was also in town for my sister's wedding and staying down the street. When I returned later that evening, my key had stopped working. The door staff told me that my card had declined again (what they were charging after having approved the initial deposit is still beyond me) and refused to let me in the room. This was in the middle of the night long after the bank had closed, leaving me in the lobby for hours while I attempted to resolve the issue. The hotel staff was extremely…"
1354,"The hotel room are big and seem renovated but is not really clean. I like the toilet as is big, but there’s a see through window which can only cover by a curtain that can still see through in between the gap. The biggest problem i face among the 5 days that i stayed there is the hot water system. I need to on for 10 min to become hot and within few min it will become cold again. I did feedback to the reception for 3 days and it didnt really help much. Mauro was one of the guy that hrlp me in the reception.He seem friendly in the front with the smile. But i approached him regarding this, he said he will check on it and get back to me at the restuarant beside or i look for him. Since after 2 hr after i finished my lunch, i didnt see him, i went to the reception. He saw me…"
1356,My wife and I stayed here last week at the beginning of December. On arrival we found our room to be a bit dirty not cleaned properly by the staff and also the shower leaked spraying water all over the basin and mirror. However both these small details were dealt with very quickly by the staff on the desk who spoke excellent English. The Hotel is in a great position right by the Christmas market and also almost next door to the Hofbrau House Berlin a great night out in there. There is also a tube station right on your door step to take you into the heart of Berlin. We chose the Bus from the airport the TXL takes you to the TV tower get off here and walk approx 100 yds at a cost of €6 for the both of us was great value.  There are lots of restaurants close by we used Don Angelo’s…
1357,"Mediterranean Beach is a nice hotel, but for sure is not a 4 stars hotel (in my opinion). and i can explain why : the rooms are ok, but not that big as we saw in our initial offer, you need to bring your own beach towels (otherwise you need to make a deposit so they will give you from the hotel  - for a 4 stars hotel is unusual), wifi is terible, even the signal is very bad (maybe because of the area), the location of the hotel is far away from the beautiful areas of the island but you can (must) rent a car from the hotel so you can see all the amazing places overthere, We were lucky because the romanian boy from the reception helped us very much with a lot of informations and detailes,maps,car,etc. He also helped us with changing the room because we paid for double room and…"
1358,"I had a lovely stay in the ultra stylish Max Brown Hotel Ku'damm over my weekend in Berlin. I didn't have the best vibes coming in, as I had originally wanted to cancel the room (due to changes in personal circumstances) but the hotel wasn't having it and was gonna charge me for the room regardless. So that's why I'm here.   The check-in and general service was great, you get a neat little surprise welcome pack through nothing in it is of particular value lol. Next door is the mega popular Benedict brunch bar, which might feel expensive but the meals come with mimoas included. The food's alright but not worth if there's a wait and the service was very average. But if you're staying here, you'll probably be in early enough (or late enough, its 24 hours). The crowd is local but…"
1359,"Lovely hotel Good power shower,nearly blew me away it was so good.good location and 10minute from tegel airport  I would definitely stay here again Free hot coffee and tea the lobby The beds were cosy and was nice that the window opened too"
1360,"Fantastic stay. A couple issues to which one could be easily resolved. The other was structural with the plumbing. Could hear every time upstairs flushed the toilet or had a shower. Luckily it was never before 8am!   Highly recommend. Fantastic room. Distance to attractions is easily reachable by foot, and train station near by connects to all. Excellent bakeries and restraunts nearby. Take your food choices away from Las Rumbas for a fantastic meal!"
1361,"We stayed in these apartments at the start of August and were on the 5th floor overlooking the street. For a family of four the aprtments are perfect with two seperate bedrooms and two bathrooms meaning the kids can hve their own. The aprtments are well equiped, although if you are in Barcelona you are unlikley to be spending much time in them.  The best thing about the apartments is their location, just off Las Ramblas and about two minutes walk to La Place de la Catalunya in one direction and about five minutes to Port Veil, The Marina and another five to the beach.  The staff are very friendly and helpful and nothing is too much trouble for them. There is no 24 hour reception but a call out number is available if you have any problems outside office hours. We used it once at…"
1363,"This hotel is very close to the Museum complex and the Vondelpark.  The air conditioned penthouse suite was large with a king size bed, sofa, arm chair and a balcony.  Great bed and good sleeping!  It is unfortunate that the balcony was not very private with only a metal fence separating the adjoining balcony.  A bit more privacy would have been welcomed.  The room was comfortable but could have been cleaner.  It looked like the cleaning staff forgot to vacuum when the previous occupant vacated the room.  And there was a small very visible hole in the sofa.  Not what I expect in a four star hotel.  At least patch the hole!  I would stay here again.  "
1364,"If you want a bar, a pool, anodyne music in the lift and other paraphernalia of luxury then Hotel Diana is not for you! But if you just want a clean and pleasant place to sleep, five minutes walk from the Metro, in an ancient part of the city, then here is the ideal hotel. The desk is manned 24/7, by English speaking staff, all of whom have time to talk to you. "
1365,"Selected for proximity to meeting venue, but was a decent place to stay - clean, pleasant staff and reasonably priced (for the area, accommodation quality and time). Good central location - and transport links. Welcomed with a glass of cava too!"
1366,"We had a meeting at the building across the street, so the location for us was perfect. The exterior of the building is very nice, and the inside is modern. Room was good, clean. The free internet was pretty slow, I still think it is a bit old-fashioned when hotels try to charge you for decent internet. It's 2018, people. Breakfast was fairly basic, especially for the price."
1367,"We booked the hotel for our last night in SF...What a mistake!!!Upon booking found same room on Priceline for less money...Spoke with a hotel employee who said don't worry room will be free...because we booked it for more ..he verified all info....had us take screenshot for proof...took his customer number etc.....Just got the free bill......Actually charged us more!!!!,Also room they gave us special room in adjoining wing....Bathroom was FILTHY. , and looked circa 1977.....VERY LOUD room overlooking whatf parking lot.....RUN from this place...."
1369,"I and my girl stayed there for two nights, which ended up, I have to say, being an unsatisfied experience.  Firstly, the location is bad. Standing on a high slope, the hostel is 200meters deep into a lane that taxi cannot reach, which means you have to haul your luggage and walk along this distance after a long tired bus trip. Secondly, no room service. I just don’t get it why there was no slipper , toiletries and water heater in the room since they are very basic items that an accommodation should provide with. The staff told me I could get slippers fit my size upstairs in another building, but I declined. Please, I just want a pair of slippers to wear so as not to leave black footprints  on the floor, who on earth cares what size it is? Just bring me a pair! As for the water…"
1371,This hotel was amazing! Stayed in Room no 728 (suite). A great surprise having two separate toilets. The rooms furniture was perfect for what we needed. The bed was mega comfortable as were the pillows. Breakfast was perfect with great choices and service. Check in and out was seemless and the hotel were happy to mind our bags until our flight at 9pm. Super location to get around the whole of Berlin. Everything in the hotel was so clean and I could not find any fault with it. Would defo go again. 
1372,"The hotel is located in a residential area, quiet and convenient. There are lots of restaurants, grocery stores, pharmacies, and a laundry mat around. It is also closed to metro station, bus stops and places for sightseeing such as the Tower, Invalides... Staff in super friendly. Room is clean and comfy. Garden is inviting. Breakfast buffet provides lots of varieties and it is worthy and convenient. Coffee is great. Will stay again if we return to Paris."
1373,The location is good in center. The hotel is nice with a great lobby. I got upgreaded to suite and was a little old. But i was surprised by amazing shower. More You can start stop water and set temeprature by pressing buttons:) really nice. The bed was as always ok. They have amazing view from executive club from 10th floors with nice breakfast:) the only problem small towels and a little old room:)
1374,"The Hotel Indigo is very well located on the Alexanderplatz. Parking can be doen for €12 in the parking of Alexa, which is about 4 minutes walk from the hotel. The room was very small but clean and had everything you need. The hotel had a nice bar and the breakfast was good. Friendly staff"
1375,"I would never stay at this hotel again because the service I received from the front desk was extremely poor.  We had a three night reservation to stay at this hotel.  Our incoming flight from the East Coast was delayed, and we didn't get to the hotel until 2AM. As soon as we found this out, we called the hotel (eight hours in advance) to alert them.  The woman who answered the phone said it was no problem because they had a 24 hour front desk, and she make a note of this in the system. However, when we got to the hotel, the guy at the desk said they had cancelled our reservation as a ""no show.""  It was only after I explained how I called and was reassured everything was fine that he was able to locate our original reservation and said, ""oh, I see there's a note here.""  However,…"
1376,"We booked to stay here a few days before we got to Nha trang.... But when we arrived they told us they had no room and recommended we use Galaxy hotel a few doors down. Which would have been fine if the circumstances were different.   When we showed up I had just had a motorcycle accident... I was bleeding from my hands, shoulder and my knee and wearing shredded clothing. I managed to make the drive to the hotel to then be told there was no room. Again this would have been fine... If we had not been very quickly shooed out of the hotel and with all of our stuff and reminded repeatedly we needed to move our bikes as soon as possible. Obviously we had more important things to think about... I needed to clean my wounds and my boyfriend wanted to go to the nearest chemist to get…"
1377,"We stayed in the hostel for three nights. The two receptionists were really awesome. They booked us buses, tours, Taxis. They showed us good Restaurants and helped every day and nighttime. Really good. The breakfast was good. The rooms and the bathroom were not really clean. A lot of doors didn't even close. In the last night we had to change to the dorm because we forgot to make a reservation. We had some bedbugs. We got a New bed in another dorm and they washed all Clothes, shoes and backpacks which we really appreciated. They also clean the beds, which is not everywhere like that.  "
1379,As always a nice stay. Flawless and efficient service. We had an issue with our room and were changed without a problem. Nice breakfast. The location is very good near the zoo. We parked in the basement at about 25 euro pr night.  Nice room with the needed amenities. I could come back. 
1380,"Not worth the long trip from the airport.  Very little to do on the island, a difficult walk to top, but you can't walk round it, you can't kayak very far, beach tiny, huts were clean, showers were cold, geckos and cockroaches in the room.  Geckos I could deal with, cockroaches not so much.  Food was poor - set menu, no choice.  Could not imagine spending more than 24 hours on the island.   Really not worth the money or the transfer time from the airport which was 2/3 hours.  Staff we helpful but I would not return to Whale Island"
1382,"We went to this hotel on 20th August for 2 weeks. We booked a mountain view room but unfortunately the tiny  balcony meant there was only room for one to sit,  if my hubbie had sat opposite me we would have  been knee to knee. We were in room 317 and we had no mountain view. The worst was yet to come - men were continually shouting on the building site next door.The noise of drilling, cranes carrying concrete, lorries reversing onto the site was awful when you had the doors open and it was much worse when we sat by the pool. It was rediculous. I  did complain. On particular days the drilling, hammering shouting and reversing vehicles bleeping almost drove me made.In 2 weeks stay we had 2 Sundays with no noise and a Madeiran bank holiday day. Most guests tried not to be on the…"
1383,"The hotel changed price after I arrived. Also, I only could use wifi at the front. I expected that I can use wifi from room. I didn't get any bad experiences besides those two. I'm not sure that I'm going to use this hotel next time though."
1384,"We really liked this hotel - it was clean, with very comfortable beds and attractive décor.  We had breakfast and ate one evening meal in the restaurant and all the meals were excellent.  The staff were friendly and very helpful and the transport links were much better than we had expected.  We didn't mind the fact that it was a bit out of the centre of Berlin - it was easy to visit Potsdam and to explore the locality (Brohan Museum recommended).  We liked the fact that there was a safe in our room and a TV, which had a reasonable choice of channels. The bathroom was definitely on the cramped side but that was the only fault.  We would definitely visit again. Warning - do not eat in the Ratskeller   -  its very expensive, they don't take cards which can make life difficult, and…"
1385,"The hotel is renovated rooms feel clean and they have huge windowswhich can actually open to air it :) Location is great neighbourhood is residential and cool. Great plaza and quiet. The staff is incredible, nice and attentive - 5 stars! The night security guard is very nice and so are the lady and young man day staff.  Breakfast is cool, with fresh pineapple, orange juice machine and excellent coffee which mafe it made EXTRAORDINARY 2 points that made it go down from 5 to 4  1. Water goes out the shower and wet the whole area. They only need to put a small  piece of plastic to prevent this not sure why they don't. We asked and they know about it  2. Bed is small (granted we had the lowest room category) "
1386,We stayed in room 830s and we are right next to the dumpster where they dump lots of glass bottles and trash all day.  We are right above a major air conditioner unit for 2nd floor and did not enjoy the balcony because of the very loud noises.  It’s so loud you cannot hear the airplanes let alone the ocean.  We had hoped to hear the sound of ocean waves.  I would not stay here again.  Room seems outdated.  The bell hop area was full of people’s luggage and a lot of unhappy guests waiting for their rooms to be cleaned.
1387,"We booked a private room online on their website thinking we'd be staying at the Adelaide. How wrong we were, they shift people to their sister hotel Dakota Hotel. Look it up it's very shabby and completely different. The room smelt like stinky feet.  This isn't like a one off thing either, they had print outs prepared that told you where to go. They purposely over book to send people to the other shabby hotel. The staff at the Adelaide desk gave me serious attitude when I said that it was really bad that their website didn't mention they'll send people to another hotel. I felt that they were dishonest, shifty and the whole situation was very upsetting. If you get to stay at Adelaide then lucky you but I cannot state how disappointed I was with the experience."
1388,Hidden fees for nonexistent benefits and guest ammenities...dated rooms that lack function and design...rude staff and mistakes that don't even line up with a 2 star review...Save your money and drive here to see the beach but stay elsewhere.
1389,"Nice hotel centrally located and with good services and walking distance to everything. Nothing extravagant/special. My only complaint is the washroom is not so convenient- there is no conditioner for hair, no plug for curling iron."
1390,Booked a lake view room but what you aren't told is the lake is across the freeway which is 4 lanes. Yes it is a lake view but the balcony is tiny and to sit and view the lake you have to listen to the traffic and see the lake between the cars passing in both directions. The recommended breakfast cafe Bear Grill wasnt brilliant as the pancakes with fruit arrived with tinned strawberries and blueberries and far too much. The Mcduffs pub was appalling food. Freshies was excellent.  Would not stay at Azure again
1391,Had an amazing experience with my wife ... place is absolutely adorable and the staff speaks English ... they were all so helpful and nice .. the room was a great size and the metro was very close and the atmosphere in the area is what we came for.. FRENCHY...  we plan on coming back.. heads up you will need a power converter coming from the US... luckily the wife had one ...
1392,"First time staying with this brand of hotel. We was greeted with a smile at the very modern front desk. The lady on reception spoken good English and was very helpful.   Our room was clean and the bed was really comfy. The large window opens all the way and the wifi in the room was good too. Another bonus was the excellent shower. The pressure was surprisingly good, although the temperature did seem to drop higher and lower but this is minor.   Location was great. A short walk to the nearest sights. My only issue is that there isn't a local shops nearby that sells bits like water / snacks etc... There's just higher end restaurants.   Pros:   Good wifi  Good quality shower & bed  Modern hotel design  Helpful staff  Cons:  Location although is close to most of the main sights, not…"
1393,Be careful ! Booked this hotel via booking.com for 3 nights in August 2019. Price was confirmed verbally on check in. when checked out I was told all is OK that I will receive an email with my receipt. I never got a receipt but got charged an additional 100 USD to the credit card. The hotel is not answering to my emails and questions. I read now may are having the same íssue which means that this intentional by the hotel. .   
1394,"+ : nice and comfortable room, great and delicious breakfast, good price, nice employee at the reception (Mr. Omar), room service was fine, helpfullness in many situation, free luggage room. - : not allowed to take road bikes to the room"
1395,"If you have Platinum status with SPG/Marriott, don't bother staying here as they ignore it.  They put you in the smallest room in the hotel, and their service sucks!  My room had no cups to go along with the coffee maker and when I requested a hair dryer, it didn't show up for hours!  Chicago is a town full of great hotels and this clearly isn't one of them.  Marriott has done a poor job at recognizing Starwood's best customers, and this hotel is a classic example.  Avoid it!!!!  There are plenty of great options nearby."
1396,"Tried to check-in at 3PM and was informed the room wasn't ready.  Desk clerk said he would call us. At 5PM, no call.  We called the hotel & was told that we had checked in.  Of course we informed them we hadn't.  Finally got our room and I couldn't believe how small the bathroom was and how outdated the decor is.  Bed was terribly uncomfortable. We had a huge mirror embellished in wood freestanding in front of the closet. Couldn't figure why it was there.  The room was so small and it certainly didn't need this huge mirror. Called the front desk to complain about the room, but he said no other room available. Hard to believe as it was a Thursday.  We believe the room we booked was given to someone else since they thought we had already been check in.  Do yourself a favor and…"
1397,We arrived ahead of schedule so checked in whilst reception was still open. We had a lovely friendly welcome from the staff. We had a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom apartment on the 4th floor and the place was immaculate. Very clean and spacious with great amenities included within the apartment. We really enjoyed our stay here and would recommend this apartment to others. There are small supermarkets nearby for essential supplies and the metro is literally 1 minute away accross the road. The nearest metro stop is Sant Pau on the blue line. Sagrada Familiar is a short 10 minute walk away or the next stop on the metro. Be careful for pick pockets in the stations - i had my phone stolen as we boarded the train!  We visited Camp Nou via the train and had a great day there. We also spent a…
1398,staff are great the hotal is passable service at start of week was good but only 2 days later was if you get it not there tables not set pots not removed out door areas not sweeped glass left on floor for 2 days after being told and put on table only to have it brushed of back onto floor not as good as could be for a pestana a little of a let down
1399,"Slim staffed and long wait for both check-in and check-out, possible explaination for the poor customer service attitude, but not for the unfortunate English skills expected with this price level in Shanghai. Very small, dark, dull,  extremely overpriced rooms with terrible views from three directions of old tower, the lobby/halls are even grim. Newer tower lobby/halls are slightly lighter/more recent decor, a little larger, better view, but the bathroom was just as outdated as in older tower. Hotel is a complete people mill, cleaning staff begins to knock at 10am to move you out for the next round of unwitting travelers."
1401,"Maybe that I was particularly bad lucky during my days at the Royal Meridien, but these are my comments. First of all entering the room the airconditioning was posed at more that 26 degrees so with sun shining in fron of the window this was not the best welcome. Room: I did not like to have the washing basin directly into the room (not in the bathroom) and the shower area again directly on  the bathroom floor without any separation; bad soundproofing, a neighbour arrived in the room during the night and it was like as in my own room. Breakfast: first of all the refresh of table following a customer was rather slow so difficult to find a place at peak hour, furthermore croassants were not so fresh. Gim: warm, too warm. Finally although I understand building refurbishment work, it…"
1402,"We stayed at HUB In Lisboa..at first I felt like it was too rustic, and there was like a bed, chair and long bench, nothing else.. not AC or fan or mirror in the bedroom.. but then I thought that it was like an adventurous trip and forgot about it. The sheets were very clean and soft, the bed was better than other places I've been.. floors and everything clean until you get to the shared bathrooms... not too dirty but not very comfy and there is no great maintenance or things to manage to clean or dry the floors..on the other hand the people working there is very nice and helpful and you can sleep good because of the good weather. I'm not coming back but it felt like something I had to do in my life.. been there, done that..✔️"
1403,"Special mention: Marta Sofia Bausani of The Level was a big help when my passport was stolen. It was most distressing! But she made things much better by: 1) giving me directions to the police station 2) calling the train station to arrange a change in our booking to madrid and 3) and by attending to our needs. This was on top of her regular work of booking a tour for us, etc. She reduced our stress."
1405,"The entrance to the hotel is designed to impress. However for me the service is what counts. We had a number of unusual experiences. One was trying to book seats on a flight. The hotel has a travel centre. The booking clerk said that we had to pay 300R for him to book our seats, the flight was prepaid, however he could not guarantee he would be successful? You cannot drink around the pool, only in a small smokers covered area outside the bar. We were told that we could add food and beverages to our room bill, but the coffee area insisted we paid them directly. It took forever to get the waiters to deliver drinks but they insisted on us not using bar directly. I had to insist on paying my bills in rupees as they default to dollars."
1407,"I decided to this hotel and Dockland for the first time because the booking write up offered ""sensational harbour views from this apartment"". I have come across misleading advertising before but this takes first prize. Our view was directly onto the half completed construction site next door. If I hung over the balcony I could see a bit of the harbour. After complaining bitterly we were moved on the second day to an apartment that had a slighly better view,the direct view was a strip of concrete but you could see a bit of the harbour off to the right. No recompence was offered for the inconvenience. Being a Accor Gold Card member I complained  directly to their customer service staff who promised to investigate and come back to me, it is now more than a week later and I have had…"
1408,I just returned home from my vacation in Hawaii. I stayed at Hilton Waikiki n thought everything would be great. My first lousy encounter was trying to have breakfast in the hotel I was staying in. I was told I needed a reservation to have breakfast. That same morning i waited over ten minutes for hot water in the shower at 530am. The last insult was when I asked could I check out at one o'clock instead of noon. I was told that was for sliver or platinum members n my Hilton honors card would not help. So much for Hilton and their honors program. I truly was dissapointed with my whole experience. 
1409,"Just left the hotel with my parents after staying 3 days and I strongly feel that I have to write and thank for the amazing service. The location is so well, so convenient and so close to everywhere for a short visit in Paris. Our room was perfect; clean and cozy. We were only minutes away from the beautiful centre of Paris.  Above all is the people working in this beautiful hotel! Every one of them were utterly helpful, sincerely friendly and all smiles. A very special thanks to Yasen who welcomed us at the check in and eased and arranged everything for us at the check out as well; you are an amazing person and hope you to be very successful in your life! We are so lucky to run into such beautiful people in a short time; a very big thank to all of you guys!  "
1410,"My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at Le Rayz.  The front desk gentlemen was super helpful and made sure everything was taken care of.  The location is very good and fortunately it is off the street which provides a nice sound buffer.  Great value, highly recommend."
1411,"If I were you - i'd stay somewhere else...  Whilst is has great views and is well placed everything else is mega expensive and a 15% service change no matter what you get or ask for.  However, the  room cleaning staff need praise as I left something and within 24 hours they had emailed to tell me and would have sent it back.  The one area to avoid is the SPA - after a 15 day business trip I wanted a hot stone massage. What I got was a poor massage and then they tried to rip me off for two hours rather than the one hour I booked.  The hotel manager was very apologetic and I got the impression I was not the first !"
1412,"We stayed in this lovely, clean and quite hotel from June 10-15. It was so pretty,! The owner Anne was so very helpful with anything that we needed! She suggested restaurants, gave us directions for the bus and made us feel right at home! It’s a great location in a residential quite neighbourhood with shops, restaurants, park across the street, grocery store and bus station all within walking distance. If you stay there , grab some cheese and baguettes and wine and enjoy! It is exactly what you would picture of a quaint and pretty hotel in Paris. I give this hotel a 10 and would highly recommend it! And if you want a fantastic meal, try Kenze M restaurant down the street! Mouthwatering food and a lovely owner! "
1413,"Staff were great and breakfast was also good (we had them make us an omlette).  The room.....where do I start......we stayed for 2 night's was suppossed to be 3 but we cancelled the third night to stay elsewhere.  Overall the room was tiny maybe ok for one person but for two people we were tripping over each other , the bed was uncomfortable and the bathroom again was on the small side nice shower but the water goes everywhere so yr floormat is soaking.  The rooms don't appear to be sound proof either so be prepared to get woken up at odd hours of the night.  Would I stay here again.....answer no and for a mecure hotel a little disappointing."
1414,"Room was nice and bed of high quality. Dinner at restaurant chaotic. We spent there 3 hours and the person who served, despite being a young and very kind waiter, did not know the basic things.  Irregular service at breakfast. We stayed 2 nights and the first day it was good but the second one, it was not."
1415,We stayed at the Times Hotel mid week in November  The staff were most welcoming and helpful and the hotel very well positioned in the canal district and for exploring Amsterdam  Our room was a small additional premium on the price as 'canal view' but was very 'bijoux' and quite dark. Also the canal view was through a low set window with limited view Breakfast was expensive so we went out to local cafes Would recommend for  location and comparative pricing
1416,"This is a new hotel in an ideal location with access SDU airport and a new mall.  Unfortunately, even by Brazilain standards, the service is poor.   Bar service at snails pace, room was hot and items in Mini-bar were also hot.   Asked for replacements for the mini bar twice, arrived 25 minutes later ... but the good news is the room was getting cool by then.  I have been traveling to Brazil since 1986 and have stayed in 100s of hotel, I guess I expected the service to match the excellent facilities.  Thanks,  Howard"
1417,"I booked my wedding block at the Westin River North and had an awful experience; I definitely wouldn't recommend it.    First off, they use an online booking system for their wedding blocks and it kept telling our guests that the block was full when it wasn't.  The Westin expected ME to reach out to guest that tried to book to explain the error; however they did not even know who tried to book.  I am not contacting 200 people to see which ones got error messages.  Our contact with the hotel kept changing and we were finally (somewhat) consistent with Latanya Grandberry but she honestly wasn't much help as she doesn't work weekends and basically just said, ""oh oops sorry"" for any issue we had.  Next, my parents' room was all screwed up.  They were unable to check in when promised…"
1418,"One of the worst hotels I’ve stayed at...not even 3 star. The deluxe room was awful...the supposed deluxe king size bed was merely a cheap Ikea bed frame and curtains full of holes...very dated and shabby - yet we were charged a small fortune for this supposed luxury! The maids are a joke...every day we had to call to get towels delivered as they forgot to leave those, body wash and toilet roll...the basics that you’d expect! Utterly rude and incompetent front desk staff with limited customer service skills. The breakfast is best avoided...takes forever to get a table and served and the food is poor and extortionate...we only suffered breakfast once and thank goodness we discovered Orange Blossom across the road. The pool is disgusting...water is dirty and full of litter with…"
1419,Very convenient location for connecting your travel with both Berlin airports and city center. The buffet breakfast was good. Nice public areas where you can sit and relax. Wi-Fi connection was strong and stavle
1420,"Located close to the expo98 area it is a little bit far from the major sightseeing spots but luckily the hop on, hop off busses are stopping very close to the hotel. Easy to reach from the airport, less than 10 Euro fare. The rooms are OK, the bed is good, a little more maintenance would be good. There is no lobby which deserves that name. The breakfast area is small and crowded, the breakfast is standard. All things are there but nothing special. The staff is very friendly and supportive. All in all - with this hotel you can make nothing wrong, but don’t expect anything special."
1421,"Very convenient for my office, breakfast is good, rooms are clean and confortableOverall sensation it needs restying and some new facilities. Restaurant in the evening is to avoid (high prices and medium quality) better go out"
1422,Be wary of this hotel. Other than excellent location there is no value or incentive to stay. There is no adequate room service. Basic items such as towels require f up calls that remain unanswered. Staff at desk apologizes but does not remediate any ongoing issues. Promised rooms and even room preferences are wholly disregarded. World of Hyatt didn't intervene whatsoever. Upon departure manager does not return calls. Calls themselves offered and promised by staff. If location for business critical that's all there is. And bring towels ! This is not s 4 star property. 
1424,"I will recommend this hotel to all my friends who in future will go visit Paris. Small cosy ,very tidy calming and quite place for relaxing.Lovely design of wall beside bed. Easy to find from airport just pick the bus Airport- Eiffel Tour and go to Trocadero stop.Very good location...Eiffel tower only few min walk..a lot restaurants around,Metro as well..you can go where you wish. Hotel staff very friendly and helpful ."
1425,"The hotel is in very good location, there are 3 metro stations and tram all within 7min. from the hotel. You can also walk to La Cuitadella park and Sagrada familia in 15 minutes. The room was reasonable size with summer terrace (only rooms on the top floor). Good size bathroom and nice shower. Hotel provides shower gel and soap but no body lotion. Good selection on breakfast: 3 types of bread, ham cheese, pastry, yogurts, fruit and vegetable, cereals. Coffee could be better. Not many Spanish/tapas bars around the hotel but the Las ramblas and old town is only 3 stops away by metro."
1426,"A really bad resort, that looks better at the first look. After 2 weeks here we really had enough! We were 10 persons staying here and we all had bad experiences.   * My parents had a lot of black mold in their shower! Disgusting! Not healthy! * They have cockroaches! * My oncle and his wife had dirty water comming from their shower.  * The staff is very hard to communicate with, they hardly understands any english at all but they pretend that they do.  * The restaurant at the hotel is the worst in the whole Ong Lang-area. DON'T eat here! There are plenty of good restaurants in the area. They can't cook, you will get something complete different from what you order or they forget half of the order.  * They dubbelbooking rooms even when you have paid for the rooms. They give away…"
1427,"We stayed in an M room which had plenty of space for two people, lots of storage and a lovely bright bathroom. Everything was clean and comfortable, the staff was helpful and friendly. We didn't try the breakfast, only the coffee and tea which becomes available to everyone in the afternoon. Overall the hotel made me feel safe and comfortable, if I went back to Berlin by myself I'd choose this place again.  What I didn't like: our stay would've been MUCH better if our room didn't face the street. There's no AC and the air got stuffy during the very humid week, so we had to keep our windows open. There is a fan provided though. The street can be really noisy, so even though I enjoyed my stay, I didn't actually sleep very well at all, but I'm a light sleeper. Next time I'd request…"
1428,"Okay good bits first - rooms are a good size, great location & staff are friendly & efficient. The view from the rooftop pool is lovely.  Not so good bits ...... we liked to come to rooftop pool everyday for a chill after being out - the hotel only has 1 CD - jamiroquai - played on a loop. Someone even asked for it to be changed one day & they ignored that request. It’s literally like torture hearing it over & over again - if anyone from the hotel is reading this please turn it off - no music would be better than jamiroquai on a loop!  Our room overlooked the road - no issues with noise but the room was always dark - the rooms overlooking the harbour are the same size but nice & bright  Breakfast wasn’t great - opted for an omelette most days but not that much choice"
1429,"Pro: -Central position -Short walking distance from the tube and    train station -Delicious breakfast -Welcoming Staff -Clean room  Cons: -Room temperature (extremely hot) -During weekend it tends to be a little noisy because of the club in front of the hotel -Dodgy people around the area, especially in the evening/night  "
1430,If in paying $300+ per night I expect a certain min level of standard amenities. This hotel is no longer a part of SPG - it accepts your loyalty number but that's it! Worst and completely unacceptable was their TV package. Only in room for a while since I'm here for work but no movie channel - HBO Etc. You have to request basic amenities that most hotels have in your room - shower cap and vanity set Etc. Many better options for this price point 
1431,This hotel is an ideal location but thats where the compliment ends. Tiny rooms very overpriced. 24 hr pool but they would rather you not use it at your leisure. 30 dollars a day for resort fee but nothing extra is offered to you Their dont give a care attitude is very frustrating especially Anthony who claims to be the manager. Also keep an eye on your credit card multiple charges added. My husband and i travel quite often and this is one of the worst. Dont stay here...
1432,"Stayed recently at this hotel !  Good value for money and extremely good location. The hotel room was clean, quiet ( which I requested ) and very good breakfast.  Maybe they could be a bit more generous with the towels in size and quantity."
1434,"No..... Iron Coffee machine Wireless (claim to be included  but charge you) No hair dryer  Crummy bathroom and tub Substantial fee increase for twin queen bed room (free through orbitz)  This is an extremely basic hotel... My room essentially had a bed, tv and bathroom... Nothing more. Definitively not luxurious."
1435,"Is this a first world problem, am I just a spoiled traveler, or is this a real problem?  3 times within the past 18 hours I've had no hot water in my bathroom.  I've never seen anything like this.  I've had hotels where the hot water is intermittent, but never where the hot water is non existent."
1436,"The hotel don’t worth 4 star. In Europe this would be a 3 star hotel.  What I did like: - location. It’s close to Copacabana beach and to Rio Sul mall  What I didn’t like:  - cleaning was poor. And it wasn’t due only to the cleaning lady but also to poor maintenance  - the internet via WiFi works very slow or not at all - in 9 says the breakfast was the same, no variety at all - the AC has the filters dirty, it’s very very noisy and lacks of maintenance, it was almost broken and it was that old that it didn’t matter how you turned the buttons, it worked the same (the same temperature and fan speed) - the room was very noisy overall, due to the fact that is located on a very transited boulevard and due to the fact that the windows are not properly isolated. Furthermore a lot of…"
1437,This is a gem of a hotel in a fantastic location. A lift might have been nice as we stayed on the 6th floor. But a little exercise didn’t do my friend and I any harm. All in all we had a great time and would definitely stay at the Hotel Marignan again on my next visit to Paris
1438,"Horrible internet service, barely English speakers on desk, very old hotel not being improve, definitely I wont go back.  Top of all didnt want me to upgrade being platinum member and having available rooms, "
1439,"Got this trip from a sale - Miami is great, this hotel not so much. The TV service is sketchy at best - poor reception meant it kept cutting out.  The service of the restaurant is rude - twice my partner and I were greeted by a gentleman who was both rude and aggresssive. They change the prices and happy hour at will - I’d advise you to walk 10 steps and go to the Tavern for food/drink/atmosphere. There was flooding in the main reception while we were there and damp on the walls. The air con is temperamental at best - dont expect it to work all the time. The positives are that you get fresh towels daily. Best advise - avoid and go somewhere. It’s a cheap hotel for the area but I’d not stay here again - there are cheaper and nicer hotels about the area."
1440,"The position is not that close to the attractions but in the other hand is not far. If you travel with children the zoo is close (10’ walking) could be useful   The hotel is ok , is clean , personal is kind and helpful The negative note was the room too small , hard to move with 2 baggage. The bed was confortabile and WiFi worked perfectly. Positive breakfast , was huge with a lot of things to eat ... there was even a corner for gluten free. "
1441,The staff were friendly and really did try their best to accommodate us. I was reluctant to post this review but just had to warn people against this hotel. It's dirty and very tired. It's nothing like a five star. We had to change room 3 times for a 3 night stay. The first because they had basically downgraded us. The second because the bed sheets were dirty with pubic hairs. You have to wait 10 minutes every time you want the lift and the porters were clueless as to which rooms to bring our suitcases too. All the rooms were not cleaned fully with piles of dust left in the corners. As I said the staff tried their best but this hotel is in serious need of renovation and a deep clean. Understandably it was carnival weekend but the amount we paid did not warrant half of what this…
1442,"Having stayed and seen several other hotels in this town, Club Maintenon is definitely my favorite. Rooms are clean and spacious. Toiletries are supplied. The bed was big and comfortable. If you feel the low floors are not secure enough to your liking you can roll down the metal curtain and it gives a lot more security. The breakfast could be better but it was already sufficient with juices, coffee, pastry, cold cuts, yoghurt, eggs, sausages, fruit etc. English speaking staff are very helpful and nice. It was conveniently located at 7 minutes from the Palais. if you are attending convention it takes 7-10 minutes walk. Close to train station. Supermarkets are nearby. "
1443,"I stayed in this hotel only for one day in May, 2017 but I had a really bad experience.    First, there are two buildings connecting as one.  If there is nobody leading to you to the room, it is going to be a hard time for you to find your way.  This is exactly happened to me on that day.  After checking in, me & my family walked up and down for 10minutes to look for the elevator and nobody offers us a tour to the room.  However, we finally found the elevator, but we ran into a white lady talking to the worker, 'I can never find my way without you. thank you very much.'  Does this mean they treat guests differently? Why did they not lead me and let me on my own?  I paid the same price.  Because I am an Asian?    Second, I had terrible experience at the health club. they have the…"
1444,"This is a modern hotel with large, comfortable rooms. The front desk staff are very helpful. The location is close to the airport, about 15 minutes, but you need to take the subway to get to the old town. The hotel restaurant is not great, like eating in a school cafeteria, with an average buffet. The parking garage is a nightmare with tiny parking spaces and many obstructions. Our housekeeper really did a basic job. She cleaned the bathroom, replaced towels, and made the beds. Dirty glasses were not replaced and any crumbs or glass rings on the counter were not taken care of."
1445,"Just a short walk down the river Spree to Unter den Linden and the Museuminsel - what a great location!  We had a wonderful, spacious room with a big bathroom - plenty of room to dry off a few clothes!  On a VERY hot few days in Berlin (around 36C) having an airconditioned hotel was a big bonus!  There is an excellent restaurant about 100metres across the bridge from the hotel (Weinhaus) and the Gendarmenplatz is within easy walking distance.  The marvellous Liebeskind designed Jewish Museum and Checkpoint Charlie are within walking distance as well.  Modern, sleek hotel with good amenities."
1446,"When you walk into this property you feel like its a very well kept property. They even have a pleasant fragrance wafting through the lobby (to cover something up, perhaps?) However, my experience left me believing this hotel was anything but clean.  First of all, the doors to the rooms are rather light in weight, so you can hear every sound in the hallway. Since it is a popular area for tourists, there were tons of kids running up and down the hallways late at night and early AM.   But the bigger problem was with the cleanliness of my room. On my first night, I pulled the covers back to discover the sheets were not pulled taut (imagine the comforter tucked in as if the bed is made, but the sheets are rumpled in the middle). I also found 3 stains on the sheets, one a grease…"
1447,"Until this week I've never stayed in a hostel before. I have to say, it wasn't as bad as I thought.  At £59 for 3 nights. Can't really complain that much. The bed was comfortable enough, if you like a firm mattress. The staff are helpful when there is actually staff in the building.  This hostel is right next to a metro stop. Which goes to nearly every single tourist attraction.  I'd recommend here if you're literally just looking for a bed to sleep in. "
1448,"Im a gold a member and i have never experienced such a bad treat like in this hilton. Dirty, overrated and rude working people. Price is ridiculous for what you get. Never back here for sure. Despite i am a gold member i did not get any of the benefits!"
1449,"I am not a fan of this property - at all.  The staff is very friendly, and the hotel is conveniently located, but, the rooms are terrible.  They are cold an uninviting.  First of all, they're black.  Everything's black.  The entire hallway, the granite floor in the bathroom, the closets, the shower, etc.  Speaking of the shower it's a big step down, and the shower head doesn't spray correctly.  Plus, it's hard to get on & off, as well as to get the correct temperature. The other issue I had was that there is absolutely no power in the bathroom - nothing.  Zip.  Nada.  It made it very hard to dry my hair in the morning. Same issue with the coffee.  It is in the [stark black] closet, but there's no plug to operate it.  So, you have to carry it on to the tiny desk, which by the…"
1450,"This is a good hotel with an excellent service and lobby area. Location is great with lots of good close restaurants. The only reason I don’t give it 5 stars is because I expected better pillows and a better mattress, also, the toilets show the age of the hotel and would be better at a 3 star hotel. The rest of the room is good as you would expect at the Hilton. Have to say that value was quite good and will probably return."
1451,This hotel was a fantastic find! Very clean and well run with an outstanding location near all the sites in Paris.  My room was very quiet. Highly recommend this hotel and will stay here again on my next trip!
1452,"We stayed at the Chi for a week during the record heat in June. The hotel was very comfortable, effective air conditioning, large bed, good shower with great hot water and water pressure. The room was very modern with a place to hang clothes but no drawers. I also felt very secure with the elevator being key card activated (as well as the key card activated safe in the room). There is someone at the front desk 24 hours as well. We had a room facing the street. There was a small balcony--not wide enough for a chair. The street noise when the balcony door is open is pretty loud though. When closed, we didn't notice it. The location is very convenient to the red line on the metro, and we used the metro a lot! We had the breakfast every morning and it was quite good, European style…"
1454,I will start with the good cause it's shorter. Juan the bartender is great. Front desk staff is great. Now the bad. 75$ a night for incidentals is too much. And they charge it for every night stayed! So if you stay 10 nights that is 750$ in incidental charges! Give me a break. Nothing in the room is even worth 75$ not even the bed. Elevator is like something out of a horror movie. Rooftop closes at 10 pm? The view does not even get good until then. Mold in the bathroom and ceiling falling apart. Musty smell coming from a/c unit. This place needs a total renovation. Especially if you are charging 250$ a night during convention season. You are better off staying near o'hare airport at a motel for 100$ a night and taking a cab into the city. Will cost you less.
1455,"Spent a night at the hotel and check in on the afternoon of Saturday to go to the Opera, obviously came back late and ones I was in bed realized that the bathroom was licking and made an awful noise the all night long, was just too tired to call the front desk to move to another room. Next day, woke up early to go to the park and enjoy the morning, did not take a shower until I came back close to midday for my check out, my surprise when I realized that the room had not hot water for some reason. Made my complain and the checkout but the person at the front desk was not very receptive and when I asked her for the complains book she gave me a piece of paper, obviously I did not wanted to waste my time leaving a complain on a filthy piece of paper so I am leaving my complain and…"
1456,Stayed here for two nights and hotel was not what it looks like on the internet and on Trip Advisor. Hallways and stairs bloody hot and dirty carpet. Surprise was the sauna which was placed in the elevator.  Breakfast was not suited for westerners and mediocre at best. Rooms were quite big and were sufficient for the price we paid.  Worst thing was the swimmingpool which was not cleaned overnight or during the day (no filtering?) and had the same amount of hair as the regular Vietnamese hairsaloon on the floor after a busy day.  At departure we found out why their rating on Trip Advisor is higher  than it should be; staff was pushing to write a good review on Trip Advisor.  Not the way you should run a hotel!
1458,"Nice hotel located in a very good position, very close to metro station, bakery and supermarket. Rooms are clean and with all the necessary although are very small. Also the staff is kind and prepared, so if I'll be back in Berlin I'll probably choose this structure again.."
1459,Neat and clean but a very small hotel. Not too many choices for breakfast. Expensive compared to the services it offers. But the location makes up for it. Walking distance from the supermarket and tram station.
1460,"We had a pleasant enough stay at this hotel. We had communicated with the owner on a number of occasions prior to arriving to arrange 2 rooms for the six of us, especially to ensure it was suitable for my husband who uses a wheelchair and we were assured it was all accessible.  Unfortunately we were never told he'd be unable to get to the pool area, one of the key reasons for staying there. It was a good base to explore the island from and the staff were certainly helpful and friendly."
1461,"this hotel was not at all what I expected, the location is great but the bedrooms are oldish and a bit dirty. the bed cover had a stain which made me doubt of the quality. the bed are not really comfortable and shower has a weak flow. Staff is very friendly and helpful and the price is great. so Ok for one night"
1462,"Great location, but construction next door caused us to request a room on the opposite side of the hotel, which took a few attempts to get right (Grr!). Disappointed that there is no restaurant/Cafe in the hotel, had to go out into wet/windy weather for brekkie."
1463,"TThe woirds that we would use to better describe this Hotel are: Secure, quiet, clean, comfortable, hotel, delicious breakfast, Fast, kind, helpful staff. All of that is worthy. Thanks Hotel San Regis."
1464,"Hotel Sylter Hof in Berlin is a typical hotel for business visitors. It has all the facilities needed for a nice stay. Nice rooms, ordinary breakfast and a modern interior.  The best thing about this hotel is the location, ten minutes walk from Europa Platz and Kurfurstendamm."
1465,"Overall we did enjoy our visit to the hotel after reading other reviews we lowered our expectations. Pool gardens, views and breakfast all very good. Staff friendly sort out any issues quickly . In its day it had been a 5 star hotel but not anymore the rooms are clean we had a huge bed and a great harbour view watching the cruise ships come and go. Rooms really need bringing into the 21st  century really don’t like a shower curtain touching me in the shower and space very narrow in the shower and I’m quite small. Rooms need to be brighter and fresher looking. Funchal is amazing can’t wait to go back. For an excellent meal please try the Earnest Hemingway it’s about 5 minuets left from hotel you won’t be disappointed   I think like us you would enjoy your stay here knowing what…"
1466,"My friend and I spent a weekend at this hotels. The property and rooms were very cozy with modern and clean furnishing. It was only a few minutes walk from Champs Elysees and very reasonably priced for that. Staff were very helpful, friendly, attentive and available 24/7. Highly recommend for solo travelers or couples. "
1467,"Good location but this property has a major issue with bad odour in the rooms. Not sure if this comes from the carpets or the furniture, both are very dated. We were initially offered a room on the 3rd floor which had a disgusting smell. Then moved to the first floor which was slightly better but still bad.  Need to constantly keep the window open, even at night. Noisy street right outside.  Hotel staff well aware if the issue but don’t seem able or willing to do anything about it.   At $600/night this is a compete joke. The place needs a total refurbishment  "
1468,"Clean, modern friendly hotel in a great location whether you are gay or straight. Wonderful front desk people, cheerful cleaners, friendly bar staff. Clean and modern room with a comfy bed; sleek design, open concept. A ten minute walk to gay area, and right on a major subway line. I'd go back again in an instant."
1469,Have stayed at this hotel many times and have seen it’s decline on guest room cleanliness along with slow and sometimes minimal elevator service.  It’s such a beautiful and great location but definitely not worth the money considering it’s current issues with guest rooms.
1470,"If you are in your 20's and like groovy nightclubs, this may be the hotel for you. Otherwise, look elsewhere. It is definitely not family friendly. Also, the room was not very clean. I would not recommend this hotel. "
1471,"The ships use this hotel as their destination hotel and it  was very crowded and busy,  The lobby is full of people in lines  and luggage was stacked all over the lobby - there is not enough room to sit.  We did not get into our room until 6 p.m. after a long flight from Miami - The air conditioning was broken in the room and we kept calling for someone to fix it - it was 95 degrees outside.  They never fixed it and didn't change our room because the hotel was so full."
1472,"First of all I have to say I really wobbled between 3 and 4 rating points. I would have liked to give 3.5 if possible.  The building was modern, nice and spacious with a beautiful terrace. The apartment features two rooms, so you have to share the apartment (kitchen, living room and terrace) with maximum two other persons. We really had a great time and enjoyed our stay. All of the rooms were very clean, Pedro and especially his father put a lot of effort into cleaning. They also were very friendly and hospitable.  The price was also very reasonable and a bargain.  Despite the hype and high ratings on other platforms we found some negative points.  The kitchen has just basic equipment. We were quite curious about the reviews on booking.com saying that the kitchen is well…"
1473,"Conveniently located near the airport, excellent gym / spa and breakfast/ meals at the hotel restaurant is superb. Bar staff also very attentive. Check in / out needs to be improved. I got charged for 1 night prior to the stay (when I should not have been as booked through a travel agency with card guarantee), this cause some hassle at check out apparently due to wrong rates in the booking. Also received a wake up call @ 6.30am which I have not requested. "
1474,A fantastic hotel. Staff were very helpful and I had a great experience. Only issue was that shower had a drain smell coming from it and the TV wasn't working properly. However I would recommend this hotel as it was a hidden gem!
1475,"Patricia made our visit so enjoyable and smooth. We had a nice jr suite, very comfortable with new bathroom. Fantastic location in the St Germain area near great restaurants and shops. Breakfast was delicious and with many hot/cold options.  Would highly recommended St Germain Academies Hotel."
1477,"We pricelined for a 4 Star hotel and ended up at the Hotel Felix.  We lived in Chicago for 6 years and the one up side is the hotel is located in a great neighborhood.  Close to public transportation, shopping, restaurants and nightlife; River North is by far the best neighborhood for visiting the city.  The lobby is pleasant smells good.  That's about it for the positives.  The negatives: - The rooms are small.  I mean, walk in closet size.  Think of what you might get in Paris and then halve it.  You get the point.  The first room was so small and looked at a brick wall so we requested a move which they granted.  Second room was still tiny but at least I could stand, touch the bed and not touch the wall at the end of the room. - The rooms are not in good shape.  Straches on…"
1478,As one of the only visibly couples of color at this hotel I am very disappointed in the treatment we received during our weekend visit. We were harassed and basically stalked by management bc a poolboy accused us of smoking in our room when he saw us on our balcony. After confirming we were not smoking staff continued to monitor us. They came to our room to remind us of the policy and tried to trick us into saying we were smoking when we were not. The following day a housemaid informed us that management rushed into our room the second we stepped out to take pictures of our valuables and belongings so that they could charge us for smoking. When we checked out management radioed staff to inspect our room before checking us out to ensure once again that we weren’t smoking. She…
1479,We stayed in this hotel for 5 nights during spring break.  The room has pretty decent size.  Front Desk folks are very friendly and helpful.  There is a business Apple computer and printer we can use.  They can buy tickets for you too.  Buy tickets earlier to save time waiting on line.  The breakfast is very nice.  Fresh bake delicious bakeries.   Orange juice and not so burn beacons.  would stay again.
1480,"In summary, I was expecting rather better from this hotel given its cost and reputation. Things got off to a bad start when instead of the panoramic view room on a high floor with double bed that I had booked, I was given a room on a low floor with no view and twin beds! No proper explanation or apology was provided by the hotel and I was left to sort out a partial refund from the booking agent. Location is OK, around a 10 minute walk to the river and main tourist restaurant area.  Room was of a decent size, but quality of the fixtures and furnishings was not good (e.g. a scratched plastic bath - ugh) and were already showing signs of ware despite the hotel being relatively new. Sound insulation was poor with significant outside and corridor noise. Plugs and light switches were…"
1481,"I booked two rooms and was asked if I'd like to upgrade to a marina view for €12.50 extra per night when I arrived. I accepted this then my friends checked in and they upgraded their  room for free.  The room was exactly the same apart from they had single beds, they had the view I'd paid for. I mentioned this on checkout after 3 nights but they said it was different because it had single beds, which doesn't make sense. The room was exactly the same as mine. They wouldn't refund my upgrade costs which I thought was very unfair. It spoiled an otherwise enjoyable stay."
1482,"Stayed for a conference 2 nights.  First night was great.  Second night the room next door was full of people having a party, slamming doors, screaming.  Also, the bathtub was disgusting and clogged.  I felt like I was in a dorm room back in college. Lots of drunk people in the elevators after 9pm.  Will never stay here again."
1483,"Had a fabulous time staying in Zoe with my girlfriend. The staff were generally friendly and willing to help, the entire place was spotless with amazing modern furnishings and stylings.   We booked a double room and word of warning this consisted of two single beds pushed together. I know this happens a lot so no massive shock, just annoyingly the thickness of the bed frames meant the mattresses didn't meet in the middle so pretty much a twin room. Would of been nice with a few basic facilities in the room such as a kettle for tea/coffee. The wash room was flawless with a huge shower area. The room was warm, clean, spacious, and fantastic blackout blinds for nap in the afternoon suffering with some jetlag.   Breakfast had a fantastic amount of food options on offer, simply help…"
1485,Hotel ambience is ok.. Rooms are small compared to other novotel properties... Food ok ok.. But too costly.. Better option is JW MARRIOT.. Marriot is far better than novotel.. Rooms of Marriott far better than novotel.. Comparatively cheaper also.. So go for Marriott than novotel when u need hotel near airport area
1486,"Confortable and Cosy room, I really like the decoration. Supernice breakfast (Do your own pancakes and eggs ;) ) and great people taking care of you all stay long ! Will come back for sure the day I go back to Paris"
1488,Stayed here for 3 nights as part of an easyjet city break package. Room was pleasant. But as it waa very warm outside 32 degrees the room was boiling even with all the windows open. We did ask for a fan at reception but this never arrived.  We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel it was €17 each. Place across the road was lovely. Room was spacious and clean. Pillows and bed was comfortable. We asked for a kettle and cups which came up from reception. Would stay again but needs  air-con in some rooms or at least enough fans to the rooms who don't. Our room 201 was fine nice and quiet when the windows are closed. Plenty of plug sockets and a stocked up mini bar. Which we used to keep bottled water cool. Hair dryer in the bathroom was good. 
1489,"During a quick visit at a good American friend visiting Berlin, the Garden Boutique Hôtel was reserved for me. I was not expecting much on this trip.  It was a happy surprise to be staying in an old  building, that is not as common in Berlin. There is also as bonus, a nicely planted and set up garden. The room was very comfortable and the wake up in a concert of singing birds, charmingly. There is nothing fancy there, except the friendliness of the Staff and a very good morning buffet breakfast. Price is reasonable to be at 2 tram stops from the heart of Berlin.  "
1490,"We read about how wonderful the Cliff Bay was but we were a little disappointed. Yes the staff are can't do enough to help you but the hotel is a little outdated. Our air conditioning unit chilled no colder than 18 degrees and this a set setting no matter what the dial on the wall reads. We had to ask for an extra fan . Our beds were very hard too and our fridge in our room didn't really keep the drinks cold which didn't encourage us to have a drink from it. Though these are negatives the buffet breakfast was excellent, though we didn't try the evening meal. It is in a very good location and our room had a beautiful view. The top pool is fresh water and the lower pool is sea water but doesn't get very cold so not many people tend to use it"
1491,stayed in the equatorial hotel on business. The room was ok but the business centre service was poor. Also this hotel is not in the best area of Shanghai - expect to be approached by people around the hotel offering extra services
1492,"I travel frequently for business. This hotel was the singular worst experience I have had when traveling. The reason - street noise. It is incessant and at a very high level. The windows have no soundproofing (verified by hotel staff). You not only hear every siren and honking car, but also car radios voices, etc. The reason is that the hotel fronts to a very busy street that is lined w bars that are open through the middle of the night. People congregate on the street below.  When I checked in, I requested a quiet room away from the ice maker and elevator. The person checking me in never mentioned street noise. The problem was apparent immediately upon arriving in my room. At that point the person at the desk said they are hoping to get soundproof windows some day. Had I been…"
1493,"Hotel G in San Francisco is a nice hotel where the king rooms are well appointed. However by contrast, the double queen rooms' bathrooms are unbelievably small.  The staff are kind and attentive.  BUT beware. There is absolutely NO security in this hotel.  The lifts are not secure and anyone can enter any floor and need not even pass reception to gain entry. There is no CCTV at all in the hotel.  The Union Square area may sound attractive to newcomers, as it did to us, but is actually 'dodgy'. No security leaves residents extremely exposed.  I will not explain the repulsive crime we witnessed on the 6th floor in the corridor. Only to say I will never forget it.  Please, single women, if you must stay in this area of San Fran, please choose a hotel with decent security. …"
1494,"The small room was in very poor condition- multiple stains on desk, discoloration of tub and toilet handle, a lot of chipped paint. Every time hot water was run in the sink there was a loud and never-ending shrieking sound. The window AC unit was extremely loud. We've never experienced a room that was so badly taken care of.   Continental breakfast was good. Providing yogurt would have been helpful.  The staff were very accommodating. Beach towels, mats and chairs are provided."
1495,"I prepaid for a suite for the night of May 27 with late check in request. We showed up at 4:30 and was told there was no reservation under my name. I pulled up my confirmation on my cell phone and showed the manager and was told they were booked and there was nothing they could do as I wasn't in their system, even though she could see my prepaid confirmation. Sat in the lobby the next hour on the phone trying to find an alternative place to stay on such short notice. Lobby was a mad house and probably worked out best we didn't stay here."
1496,Okay here we go staff perfect probably one of the best so far ... location just of the main drag ideal for the attractions possible an extra 10 minute walk over and above .. room good minus has to be the walls very thin ... art work dotted all over the hotel lovely ... roof top bar and pool fantastic .. Barcelona New Years a must 
1497,"The villa is super, 15 min walk to the centre of Cannes. Rooms are beautiful and perfect the same for the breakfast.  The owners are a very nice couple who do everything to make your stay comfortable. We will return."
1500,"This hotel may have been a 5* when first built in the 1970's but it has failed to update itself particularly the bedrooms which are 3* at best .  Given that we did not pay 5* levels of money for our holiday we are willing to forgive the dated accommodation . As other reviewers have said the shower fluctuated between scalding and cold , limited plug points near mirrors , dark furniture and totally unsuitable uncomfortable low balcony chairs which when sat on the view was totally blocked by the wide concrete rail support at eye level. No tea / coffee making facility in the room unless requested then 5 euro charge per refill of sachets. No iron . Maid service was poor , dusty shelves and balcony door continually left wide open after cleaning of room . Hotel staff unsmiling and…"
1502,"Our friends came a day before us and pre warned us that the building was undergoing work so was very noisy on one side. They said to ask for the other side to the works. So when we went to check in, we asked for the side that did not have works. The man at check in immediately replied, don't worry these rooms I have for you are on the complete other side to the works and noise. So we get to the room and it is bang smack in the middle of the scaffolding- had zero view! (see pic) was quote shocking that he lied so outrightly to our faces. When went down to the lobby, we saw him so asked why he didn't tell us about the scaffolding- especially as we had asked for the other side which he confirmed. His response was "" Well when you booked this room in the small print it says that…"
1503,Had a great stay at Pension Galerie. Angelika the host was really welcoming and very helpful. Good location to the south of the city but most places walkable; if you do take the U-bahn it  is so cheap compared to places like London. The room was large and very  comfortable and spotlessly clean. Very good breakfast was included in the price. Highly recommend.
1504,"We went there as a party of six to celebrate our anniversary. Room rates are high and we expected quality. But we did not get it. When we ordered lunch at pool restaurant, we were told it would be a 40 minute delay. ""We're understaffed.""  Dinner was great but the next morning, breakfast was a disaster! Took an hour to get coffee and food. Told waitstaff was on break; assistant filling in. Food took forever; no spoons on table and no one to get them for us. One pepper mill in restaurant. Not table-side. Had to wait until we could find staff to find it! Inn was fully booked that weekend... how do you not have staff to service? A class resort would have had extra shifts to accommodate.  We had made tennis reservations beforehand but no one put them on the schedule. Couldn't get…"
1505,Spent 3 nights there.Breakfast was not included. Would have costed 17€/person. Very large room with a walk in closet. Bathroom was tidy and large. No disturbing traffic noise. Personnel was polite. Very nice connection to city with u and s bahn. Both stations nearby.
1506,Maybe a great hostel but a very poorly run hotel. Booked it for the location but staff weren't present upon arrival and although they changed their tune were very rude when they finally showed up. Bedsheets were unchanged from the last guest. I wanted to leave but my wife entreated me to stay since it was so late. Terrible experience overall.
1507,"We are here right now and this hotel has a lot of issues. The only thing good about the hotel is the location. Even if you have status with IGH, do not expect much. Our room is maybe 150 square feet, there is nowhere except you bed to open up your suitcase. There is no dresser or fridge.our room is dirty and very dated. The vending and pop machine don't work. When it was brought up to the front desk, they just said they knew they were broken. If you stay here bring water with you. There is one pleasant person working at the front desk, the other person is very rude. I realize this hotel is moderately priced for  the area, but this is by far the worst Holiday Inn we have stayed in."
1508,"If you only book hotel by looking at its address thinking that it is in Gurgaon it is far from the city centre and worst part is that you won't also get the cabs from Ola/Uber and then you would have to be dependent on Hotel Cab for which prices are way high compare to market price, and staff strength is also very less so if you order for something in room service you need to have really good patience till the time they full fill your request, strong suggestion, please think before booking this place."
1509,"If you don't have a bike or a car and want to get around with transportation, this hotel is exactly next to the U station. You only need 2 stops to get to Alexander Platz main station and from there you get anywhere. Very friendly staff, clean room and satisfying mattress. All the basics for a comfy and economic stay. "
1510,"Loved it! The decor, the friendly and English-speaking staff, the Codage products in the bathrooms. The lovely details, the make-up mirror in the bathrooms. Wonderful beds and pillows, wonderful location and neighbourhood: it is a nice area, there is a really good bakery just across aswell as fruit and vegetable shop and supermarkets nearby. The Les Gobelins metro station nearby takes you to Galerie Lafayette in 20 min. and we walked to Montparnasse and everywhere. We are definitely coming back."
1511,A 30 minute wait to check in? Avoid unless you like standing in a queue after a long journey. You can avoid some of the wait by being a gold member. But utter contempt for the rest of us to keep us waiting so long.
1512,"Stayed at this location from Feb 7th-12. Place was horrible! Carpet was worn and dirty.  Towels were coarse, well used and dingy.  The exterior of the small refrigerator looked as if it hadn't been cleaned for some time. There was no coffee pot or means to make a hot cup of tea. Hot water via room service was R5.50.  We went with a group and felt obligated to stay at this hotel.  The location without a doubt was perfect, hotel faced the beach with easy access to shops and restaurant.  However the breakfast which was included in the cost was a big disappointment. There were long lines for coffee, with only 1 machine working most of the time we were there.  So you had  a small cup of coffee the first time around, but couldn't get another if you didn't have the time to wait on…"
1513,"I wasn't impressed by the rooms to begin with -- they smelled musty, the mattress was uncomfortable, there really aren't any amenities to speak of. I stayed here for a work trip with a group, so I wasn't responsible for the booking (I would've chosen to stay elsewhere). But the worst of the experience so far has been trying to get my coat back, which I realized I had forgotten as soon as I landed in my hometown and promptly alerted the staff to. I have sent TWO Fedex pickups, per their request, for the coat and both times they've failed to hand over the packaged coat -- it's like pulling teeth to get basic customer service out of the staff. Do yourself a favor, stay somewhere else."
1514,"The hotel 'reception' is nothing but a small office which smells very musty, however the reception staff is helpful. The pool area looks great by night.....by day its grotty and the pool unclean. Its best to use this place only for sleeping whilst visiting the falls. You MUST eat in the lodge restaurant as it's totally deserted. However the food is of a high standard. If you have an early check out - don't expect coffee or tea pre departure!"
1515,In spite of good place but the workers are not so good as they tried to get more money by any means. They added the breakfast in spite of the reservation included in and with arguments they removed it .then they added local calls to USA as long distant while the receptionist at the chick in told as it's free and refused any agreement. Thus I refuse any transactions on my credit card for this action 
1516,"30min walk outside Lagos town center is a new modern very well maintained Vile Gale Hotel. 5 min walk from a beautiful beach which is very safe to swim at. Good points: Pool is fantastic.. divided into 3 sections it's spotless..and no smell of chlorine...loads of sunloungers.. towels available if necessary... entertainment in the morning for an hour at kids club.. a d a pool bar. Rooms are very nice clean and modern..but make sure you request a second or third level room facing the pool. Food is also of a high standard in restaurant...if not as good as other 4*hotels. Bad points: staff look..tired, under motivated and at reception, a little overwhelmed and inexperienced."
1517,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Moa. Truly, there was nothing that  disappointed us. The level of service of all the staff was excellent and so was the food, but a very special mention goes to Farina, the person who took care of us in the restaurant, as she really knows how to make her customer's experience an enjoyable one. How to be back soon "
1518,"The Ibis Potsdamerplatz is well located for tourists with easy access to 3 subway lines (1 S-bahn and 2 U-bahns), a few blocks from Checkpoint Charlie and the Philarmonie.  Moderate walk to Museum Island and Brandenburg Gate, though both also easily reached by subway.  However, for those seeking local color this is NOT you best choice.  The neighborhood is devoted mostly to business.  The rooms are small, but adequate, very clean and tidy, maid service excellent.  Breakfast (included in some packages, not in others) is OK.  I've had much better, but this was OK--the usual cold cuts, yoghurt, cold cereal, eggs, good bread and rolls, and very good coffee.  If you're looking for simply a roll and coffee, don't buy the breakfast package at the hotel.  You'll pay less outside. …"
1519,"I really really wanted to like this hotel! It was beautiful! It has a lovely pool and outside area and if you don't mind traveling, it was ten minutes from Fira. We rented an ATV so it was easy to get around and we also made use of the buses, once we figured them out. My only issue with the physical aspect of the hotel was that our room definitely needed a little TLC and GOD did it need a new mattress- I had such a backache- the pool chairs would have been more comfortable. I considered it one night when I woke up at 3!  My first real problem with the hotel was that I spoke to the manager several times via email about an airport pickup because I was unsure of public transportation upon arrival. They never showed!!! We were stranded at the airport because I stupidly believed they…"
1520,Hotel is more like a cheap motel or holiday camp chalets off a centre courtyard with most rooms having large windows fronting the walkways where smokers gathered causing the smell of cigarettes to come into rooms and cig butts left on walkways. The cafe / public area downstairs resembled a drop in centre for young offenders. The rooms were however clean and tidy.
1521,"We really don't understand how this motel is 35 of 242 hotels in San Francisco in popularity index. The room was small, stinky and fetid. The window in the bathroom was broken. As we arrived we found that the linens and pillows were full of hairs. We informed the Front Desk but he simply replied that they wash the linens everyday... nothing else... VERY BAD EXPERIENCE. We stayed there only 1 night. The day after we changed Motel."
1522,"First room we got was stinking chlorine and had very loud AC (we had to turn it off to be able to sleep), as loud mini fridge. Changed room next day and got a room with black mold on lampshades by the bed (took pictures, couldn't believe it was possible) even I told them when changing rooms my husband is allergic to many things, thats why we had to change first time. Elevators were not working 3 times during our 6 nights stay. I wanted to use toilet behind the reception once and it was clogged!! stinking and dirty... Last day when we checked out and wanted to store our things for few hours I asked receptionist if they can put our passports, an envelope with money and some CC in their safe he told me, lied to me - without blinking - ""we don't have a safe"". My answer was; ""I know…"
1523,"This is a very nice hotel and I highly recommend.  First, it is very close to Museum Island and many of the other sites of interest in Berlin.  Second, the staff is friendly and helpful.  Third, the rooms are comfortable.  All are equipped with a full kitchen as well as washer/dryers.  There are nearby grocery stores.  Fourth, it has A/C which was needed this past summer even in northern parts of Europe.  One suggestion:  Some rooms have walk-in showers while others have  a shower tub.  The tub in my room was on a small platform and this made the height of the tub a challenge when getting into it.  So, if you are elderly (or not in training to be an Olympic gymnast) ask for the walk-in shower.  One of the ladies on the front desk speaks five languages - give her a linguistic…"
1524,"I stayed for a week, the rooms were comfortable and clean, my only moan is there were no tea and coffee facilities in the room.   Location was fab, right next door to a restuarant Peter Pane which served good quality food. The main Station was opposite the hotel. An easy bus service outside hotel by the station to Tegel Airport TXL which costs 2.30 euros each way and runs every few mins and stop right outside the airport, which takes 20 mins ride depending on traffic. If you walk through the station and follow the signs you can get to the  Brandenburg Gate and The Reichstag, which are 20 min walk ish. The tour bus hop on hop off buses can be caught at the station aswell."
1525,"I chose this hotel for my daughter and I because of it's ideal location so close to the airport with free unlimited shuttle service to the airport.  We used this as our home base for our two and a half days in Amsterdam.    The hotel was clean, with a secure elevator that only allowed you to go between your room's floor and the lobby. Traveling without my husband and with my teenage daughter, I appreciated this extra measure of security.   The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was very clean and modern. There was no luxury to the rooms, but they were very comfortable and the right price, so close to the airport.    We were traveling back from India to the US and I only had an electrical adaptor that worked in India.  My iphone battery had died and I asked at the front desk…"
1526,"So I book this room because it was close to my job and I had to be right back this next morning. The lobby was put together and nice and made you feel at ease... UNTIL You get to the room.... This room was so small we barley fit thru the front door with our bags .. get all the way in and it looks like a bad motel 6.  There power cords everywhere, chipped paint , water damage in the ceiling , rusted mirrors , and we tried to get in the shower and to our surprise it didn’t work. Call to the front desk and maintenance comes up and says he has to replace the entire faucet which gonna take 30 minutes  ... call bk to the front desk and they give us 801 .. we get down to a bigger room (king size bed) more space ... but this hotel needs rehab .. The food tray in the closet had rust on…"
1527,"No wonder why they have such good reviews. They are well deserve it!  The hotel is very well maintained and has the feeling of luxurious. Service is top level from all the staff. They are taking care of the guest with very high standards and professionalism. Clean and Spacious very nice rooms. Very good location.  Overall, highly recommended! Thank you for a great stay. "
1528,"Father /daughter trip to Paris for a few days. Couldn't have been more pleased with this hotel, location, the staff and the room itself! Comfortable, relatively quiet for such a busy street. AC worked very well on hot days. Hotel staff were eager to accommodate and make our stay as enjoyable and comfortable as possible. Rooms seem recently renovated and well appointed. Neighborhood is excellent. Many places to eat. Near the Eiffel Tower and the subway train station. Tasty enjoyable breakfast in a great courtyard setting. Informative and very nice hotel staff!  As someone who stays in hotels a few times a month this was a breath of fresh air and wonderful!"
1529,"The staff is very helpful and gives some good advice if needed, but the room is far below expectations. We received only 1 towel, had no hot water after 5 minutes, loads of things were broken or falling apart in the  room. The breakfast was nice on the other hand and the pool very clean! I would recommend it if youre travelling on a small budget even though there should be better options in Hue for the same amount."
1530,"My wife and I recently reserved a room for 3 nights.  When making the reservation, we were informed that parking was $39/night (it had been ""free"" when we came to this hotel for the same purpose in past years) BUT that breakfast was included in our room rate.  We figured the ""free"" breakfast offset some of the parking fee so we proceeded to make the reservation.  Later the first evening, when I asked about how the ""free breakfast"" was handled (coupons?), I was told I should have received coupons when I checked in and that they would look into it.  A bit later that night, we were told that our breakfast would NOT be complimentary and that I'd been ""misinformed"".  This, despite the fact that I was able to give them precise details of my conversations with their reps - names, dates…"
1531,"It is not exactly in walking range of all the biggest attractions, but as I would recommend using the subway a lot as it is a great and relativly cheap way of transportation, the hotel is very conveniently placed between two central subway lines which, with some line transits, can get you anywhere you want. The hotel is placed in a quiet street, so even if you get a room facing the street you will not be bothered by noise. The hotel and rooms are very clean and neat. For Paris the rooms are also relativly large and the shower is definetly a highlight as it is a rainfall shower. The air condition is not noisy either, but it is not an instant change to the temprature either, however it will gradually change. The breakfast is really great. The food is good, and the staff serving…"
1532,"We loved this hotel.  The workers were nice, the rooms were updated, and the location was great.  The free mini bar was really awesome, too!  The nearest metro station was just a few minute walk from the hotel.  There are neat cafes near by, too. "
1533,"What a friendly staff...I felt like home. I stayed 4 night and i enjoyed every second this hotel. Great Location, Great Staff and Great Breakfast. The only problem was the noise at night, sometimes people get too excited when they leave the night club, but i understand!"
1535,"Stayed in Come inn for a weekend in Berlin and we were very happy with our choice. The rooms are super clean, the beakfast buffet has excellent variety with a very nice view. The hotel is very close to both buss and trainstation. I rate Come inn with 4 stars instead of five only because the decor needs updating. Ps. There is an extra tax in Berlin which costs 5% of your hotels total cost so be prepared f or that no matter which hotel you book. "
1536,Apartment had all the amenities we needed. Shower is nice and strong. Balcony is a great facility. Bed not very comfy. Neighbourhood slightly noises but surely quieter than other areas of Lisbon. The only major downside was the loud university students congregating in the alley outside - however this is outside of the control of the apartment owner so this is not reflected in the 3 Stars review
1537,"Staff are polite and helpful. The breakfast was good with both a Continental and cooked breakfast available. Hotel in a quite area, and about 5 - 8 minutes walk from the station.  The bedroom was acceptable in size, but nothing special seeing as the hotel had a 4 star rating.   However, I have serious issues with the bedroom regarding cleanliness:-  Firstly, the carpet looked like it had NOT seen a vacuum cleaner in a long time. There were lots of bits of fluff all over it, and also many dubious stains which looked like no attempt had been made to get rid of them. Upon arrival we found that every time the bathroom door was opened it would hit the bed, and not open fully. So we ended up having to move the bed over slightly ourselves to be able to open the door correctly. However,…"
1538,"Great central location, a small walk from the hollow tooth and Ku'damm. Warm welcome at the hotel reception, staff with good local knowledge and always willing to help. Room clean and tidy with all the right facilities. Great selection at breakfast, please note it can by busy so be when you head down. Also a good atmosphere in the bar with a good selection of drinks. Hotel helpful when our flight was cancelled. Keep up the good work."
1539,"I'll start with the good news. The dorm beds are comfy and a really good size. Some of the bathrooms are nice.   Now for the bad news - there is a 30 day cancellation policy, which is totally ridiculous for backpackers (it's a ""backpackers"" hostel) if you're delayed from transport issues or you want to shorten your stay, you'll be charged, even if you let them know in advance.   The 'manager' is rude and somehow able to be lazy and a complete control freak at the same time. Air con is supposed to go on from 5pm-9am (the manager keeps the control), however, when we stayed, she went out drinking and didn't turn ours on. We went down to try and find her but she had just left a sign on the desk informing new guests to simply leave their passports at the desk. Absolutely ridiculous,…"
1540,"Came for 5 days got a great deal on hotels.com. Paid at check-in no problems. Code for wi-fi which worked perfectly for as many devices as we needed.  Handy location next to underground one stop from frederichstarsse that connects to whole network and airport express. Very clean and tidy, could do with more pillows but that's my only improvement.  All round great hotel!"
1541,"When I made this reservation I asked if it was walking distance to Fishermans Wharf, well it is if you like walking 3 miles to get there, we had to take a cab. otherwise we would have been too tired to walk around.  This location is right on the street, so at 5;30 a.m. we started hearing cars driving up the hill, at 5;45 the trash truck came and replaced all the dumpsters.  This room was like staying at a Motel 6, super plain and now where to set anything down in the bathroom, no shelf, only a free standing sink. I will never stay here again especially for 359.00 a night. What a joke!!!"
1542,"This is a resort hotel with huge public area but completely without any atmosphere. This is obviously a local 5 Star rating based on it's location directly overlooking the sea. Other than the swimming pool, spa and gym, there is really not much for children to do, not really a child friendly hotel. It has two restaurants, a large area for buffet (which was closed at lunchtime), an Italian restaurant Massimo which is very small and rather drab. There is also a pool snack bar which is open at lunch time. There are two bar but were mostly empty for the two weeks we were staying and with absolutely no atmosphere. Buffet meals were average and we only ate once in the  Massimo restaurant which was very poor. The restaurants outside the hotel are very good and thus there were not many…"
1543,"I can't say anything negative about the Clift's amenities. The hotel has a great location and it is quite chick. HOWEVER, the service is horrendous, at best. We were there for my friend's wedding. Melissa (one of their employees) ensured that we didn't feel welcomed. While taking photographs, she interrupted our session and asked us to leave- in a VERY unprofessional manner. I would expect her behavior from a Motel 6 Clerk, but NOT from a Clift member. We will NOT visit this hotel ever again.  "
1544,"We really enjoyed many aspects about this hotel. First, the location. It is very close to Savigny Platz, Uhlandstrasse and a short walk to the Zoologsiche Garten bus station. If you come into Tegel, you can get transport directly to these locations. The location is quiet and lovely with many local amenities, ranging from restaurants and high end shops to Netto and coffee shops. Second, the facilities. The room was lovely and clean. It was quite large and the air con etc were good. There are no facilities to make coffee and when we went to the bar we couldn't get a coffee. This is our only negative. There is a small CV room and sauna which we saw but did not use. Just outside, there is a small play area for children.  Breakfast was lovely, many choices and an open buffet so we…"
1546,"I rarely go to this extent unless I've had a bad experience, but I had an awful experience staying at Hotel Felix for one night. My father and I had two rooms, requested a late checkout which was granted until 1pm. My father got confused and called down himself and was told there was no late checkout, which created a huge amount of confusion. I tried to get in my room at 1215p and the key had been locked out. At this point, I went down to the front desk and there were 8 people in line waiting to check in. After waiting for 15 minutes -- Meanwhile, I'm dripping in sweat and extremely uncomfortable. I asked the bellboy, Cristian, if there was a way to get a renewed key quickly... I've never experienced such a rude, unprofessional, unkind response... he was patronizing, told me…"
1547,I had stayed here for a work trip. I was very stressed and the hotel stay went out of there was to be friendly and helpful.  During a time of stress I really appreciated there help.  I will definitely stay here again. Thank you.
1548,"We had a long weekend break, (the ladies and i) we stayed here at this hotel, which had friendly staff, however we was smoking outside of the hotel and was accused by the 're eptuonist of smoking in our rooms. Which we knew was phorbiden. We was upset by this greatly and almost made a complaint, but he redeemed himself by having a joke with us later.  The hotel had a nasty draft coming from the window which one person had to sleep next to.  I felt bad, but was not giving up my bed. We complained but only got e tea sheets, as it was FREEEEEZING. The heater in the room was broken as well as the blinds. So people from across the road could see easily into our very large window whilst getting ready. We opted to get ready one by one in the bathroom. Painstaking for three very girly…"
1549,"Overall our stay at Room Mate Emma was great. The air-con was fantastic, the room was big enough and comfortable, and the staff were very friendly and helpful, especially Carmen and I can't remember the guy's name, I think it started with G...   We were a bit put off when we first arrived though as we were told there were only rooms with two single beds left at the level we paid for as we were checking in later in the day but we could pay an extra 15 euros for an upgrade. Our booking clearly stated a queen bed and there was no mention of conditions of availability. We argued the point and after a few minutes were upgraded at no additional charge. This was unfortunate as otherwise we had a great stay."
1550,"Arrived before midnight on a Wednesday and the front door was locked, rung on the doorbell for 10 minutes before a member of staff let us in. Guy on the desk gave us our door key with no explanation of breakfast, check out times, or the hotel facilities. No information at all, and had to go back to request the safe key. Rooms were clean but were missing a few things such as a kettle or iron. Breakfast was good and had a nice variety, although again was given no information about how to order hot food. Had to wait at the bar for a member of staff to come out of the back room to ask how we order. The hotel was in a really good area and would otherwise have been a 4* but the poor service really let it down. Wouldn't go again. "
1551,"This resort is very isolated, with a gorgeous beach that you cannot swim off unless you are a surfer or made of very tough stuff (big waves, cold water).  This isn't the fault of the hotel however, and you are only ten mins drive away from a range of great beaches - just make sure you rent a car.  You would be miserable here without one. The hotel itself looks new but feels old - everything from the 80s carpets to the dated lobby remind you that this is far from a fashionable or boutique hotel.  Little things annoyed like only getting one beach towel in the room, not being left a 'do not disturb' sign on multiple occasions, and the resort shop having absolutely NO signposts to help you find it.  Feels pathetic to mention such small things but they eventually add up to the…"
1552,Lovely hotel throughout. Was not disappointed at all. Across from both train and tram stations so easy to get to the main tourist areas. In the lobby is a cafe with a comfy seating area which was great. Breakfast was included and was excellent with enough choice to set you up. There was nothing shabby about this hotel from the service down to the decor. Would recommend and would definitely stay here again
1553,"I recently stayed at Hotel Palace Berlin for three days for a conference at the same venue.  As it was very cold, I could not go out on a walking tour of the city but due to the central location of the hotel, it was easy to just drive around in a car to get an overview of Berlin in a day.  My room was very spacious and comfortable too. The conference hall is also large and with nice interiors.  Overall, I had a good experience and would certainly recommend this hotel."
1554,"As always when we go to Berlin we stay at Waldorf Astoria, our last time we saw some small changes which usually make the difference, fresh cut flowers was missing from room ( junior suite) nor any welcome back note, the flowers in lobby tables used to be more quality.. we had spa treatment booked for me and my husband ( deep tissue massage) and we both was surprised that was really to light the  pressure of the massage... Food was excellent! We love the library and Lang Bar serve divine cocktails "
1555,"Staff need an attitude adjustment and a lesson in professional service.   I've had better service at a Holiday Inn Express, and explains the cheap rates.   The location is the only good thing going for it. But you can't make up for incompetent service. "
1556,"Asked for housekeeping sometime in the morning. (Gabe a 7 hour window). Got back, room not cleaned. Tried to call front desk and no answer. Went to lobby and they told me the housekeeping manager would be with me soon - waited an hour in the lobby and he/she never came. Asked again. Same thing. Staff really couldn’t care less about me as a guest. "
1557,We booked this for a 3 day relaxation after a manic 10 day tour of North & South Vietnam. The Hotel is clean food ok but we had no end of problems with our room as soon as checked in went to room no fan working called maintenance they sent someone up to fix. 2nd day the electric stopped working at 3am no air con in 40degree heat they came and fixed at 8am . Ordered room service one night took ages to arrive and was cold food . The staff quite rude went to complain to see if we could have a couple hours added onto check out time as our flight changed re all our issues in the room so only wanted to check at 3pm instead 12 but they wanted to charge us a full night. We stayed in lots different hotels which were only 3 star much better Vinh Hung hotels much smaller and better this is…
1558,"I was immediately very concerned about the morality of those running the President hotel when I was charged almost $100 extra right after making my reservation. I booked the hotel on booking.com, where the grand total INCLUDING resort fees and taxes was $850, but I was charged $939 to my card minutes after booking the room. I called both Booking.com and was told their hands were tied and I had to call the hotel. The hotel said that this was a resort fee and the room wasn't refundable. My credit card company was willing to fight on my behalf but was sure whether it would effect my reservation. I ended up filing a chargeback for the difference after I checked out of the hotel and speaking to Chase. As someone who rarely scrutinizes my credit card charges or statements I really…"
1559,"A friend booked this hotel as all others in the area were booked.   Based from the photos from the website the rooms seems to be clean with no frills, acceptable for one night.  Upon arrival to the hotel, was a bit afraid to even go to the room.    The sheet rock was missing from the walls in the corridors, the carpet was covered in plastic.  The electrical seems to be substandard as well.   The renovations they stated were being done appeared to be completed by an untrained craftsman.   The entire building smelt like an ashtray."
1561,"The Weinmeister is a modern 'quirky' value for money hotel in the centre of the Mitte district of Berlin and it is deserving of a 4* rating. It's location is great and it's right next to a UBahn underground station 50 meters away so you can get anywhere in Berlin in minutes. The busy Hackescher Market area is only 5 minutes walk away.  The staff were very courteous, welcoming and helpful with very good English, the rooms were absolutely spotless....as is the entire hotel. They were quiet, secure, a good size and layout with great beds and linen. Every room has an iMac which also doubles as your TV (No English Channels though) and good free wifi. We didn't have breakfast at the Weinmeister because we loved the omelettes in the great cafe on the corner.  We could not fault the…"
1562,"What a disappointment. I usually stay at the Radisson hotel, but unfortunately they didn't have any opening at the time I booked my hotel.   I came in to the Windsor and immediately was disappointed with the service at the front desk. Very impersonal. I have stayed in $35 dollar motels that had a more friendly frond desk team. At some point I asked to talk to the manager and his treatment wasn't any better.   At the front desk, I found out that the hotel charges 35 reais/day for their internet. Which is almost what I pay for a full month of internet service at home. When I asked the speed of the service, I was told that they didn't know exactly.   I went up to my room and came into a extremely stinky room. I immediately requested another room as I was going to stay at the hotel…"
1563,"Our room was pretty average, located in a two storey block at the end of a laneway. Subsequently, we endured the noise of returning guests on foot cutting through the gardens by our door and the noise of cabs over the cobbled driveway. The thin walls and ceiling also detracted from the resort's tranquility as the guests upstairs dragged furniture around. We also had no hot water for showers despite reporting the problem twice.  The attempt to relocate us was too little too late as we had rescheduled our flights in order to return home early. Although the room was not the primary reason to cut out holiday short, it certainly helped us to make our decision. The main buildings and gardens were beautiful but the room we were given was not worthy of a 4 star rating."
1566,Good hotel in a good location. Nor far from the zoo and good transport links locally. Also nearby tourist attractions are accessible on foot. Berlin is huge and the choice of accommodation is endless. I selected this one having read reviews and I am glad I did. We went as a group of 4 for the Christmas markets and this location did not disappoint with one only a 5 minute walk away.The rooms are also a great size and the beds were really comfortable.   All in all a good hotel!!
1567,"We love to eat at the Hyatt for their thanksgiving buffet.  They had different stations with different foods and you could spend 2 hours grazing.  My husband and I went to the Thanksgiving luau this year and we’re very disappointed.  Not only did we have to pay more but there was a lot less choices of food.  We all had to wait in the hall to be seated after the 12:30 reservation time.   They pushed the mai tais while the host told us to visit vendors out front to buy the hula doll, Hawaii art and jewelry. We had to wait till our table was invited to the buffet line.  As I said previously the selection was disappointing.  Next we got to see the show. It was a nice show but many of the people started to leave halfway through.  We did learn how to tie a sarong into beachwear and…"
1569,"Hotel staff were friendly. I didn't face any problem there. However the hotel room service was normal compare to other hotels. They didn't provide free mineral water, coffee, or tea bags at room for each day."
1570,"Stayed at this hotel first time round about 12/13 years ago. We were a group of 5 on a city break. At that time, the hotel was fantastic, decor was lovely, staff were great, beds were comfy & location was/is superb!! However, this time round, what a bitter disappointment, I'd say the hotel hasn't been decorated since my last visit, decor very drab & tired. Wifi, totally unreliable, bedroom lighting decor etc almost dingy!!! One lady on reception was extemely rude & should not be employed in the service industry in any capacity in my opinion!! She hadn't got a clue about how to deal with guests queries. Overall a very disappointing stay, the only redeeming quality was its location, v central & convenient to everything. However, I cannot recommend this hotel based on our visit."
1571,"Four companions staying at this hotel for a week at the end of September. Rooms 106 and 110.  The rooms are large and contain two double beds, ensuite bathroom, tv, fridge, sofa bed, table and chairs with plenty of space to walk around. Room 110 had the sofa bed already made up which gave them less space and a request to reception was made for it to be put down.  This request wasn't actioned because we believe the bed was broken and couldn't be taken down. Room 110's ensuite was in a corner with many edges which aren't suitable to elderly visitors. The beds were very comfortable and sheets clean.   Towels in bathroom were clean but old. The bathrooms are in need of refurbishment, grout a bit mouldy in places and an attempt in room 106 to paint has resulted in paint splashes on…"
1572,"Really nice room, perfect for sleep and go. Even if small, arranged nice and smart. Furniture vintage imitation, excellent space optimization. Nice personal, very good services at restaurant also (served dinner and breakfast). Close to Noord, East Railway Station and also metro."
1573,"Mansilla 3935 is in an old 2 storey house in Palermo. The positives of the place are; clean airy rooms with some rooms having an 'old Argentina' feel; The owner is helpful with directions and advise around town and can speak several languages. The location is quiet but handy to public transport and to the sites of Palermo. The negatives were; the owner at times, was a little gruff (to ourselves and other guests) and the B&B did not really have that warm, welcoming feel. At times it felt like a money making concern with the guests as necessary inconveniences. During our stay guests complained to us (and we too experienced some of this) that the owner was not particularly friendly. There are several rooms so, at times, the place felt more like a mini hotel than a B&B. Breakfast is…"
1574,"This hotel has many strengths but also some weaknesses. The views, housekeeping staff & rooms & general facilities are good. The weaknesses we found were as follows: some staff seemed indifferent to us as guests; for example, some (but not all) breakfast staff didn't make any attempt to communicate with us during the entire week we stayed. I had dinner on one night and the chicken curry I was served was dreadful (I eat a lot of curry and this was one of the worst I have ever seen)...certainly not up to the standard of a 5 star hotel. The response of the restaurant manager was also inadequate, too. We didn't eat any further meals at the hotel for dinner but we did have some bar snacks and these were generally pretty good, even though they could be a bit expensive for what they…"
1576,"It was nice but, first the breakfast was a joke, you can choose only ""3"" items , and there were no healthy options, and was kind of expensive. The lockers are ouside of the room, they should specify that, as it's not a normal feature."
1577,"The rooms are small and the WiFi is terrible, Great location good for a week or 2 in a business trip.The food is great but the roomservice is bad, they seems to be always in a baad mood, like if they are doing yourself a favor. Great pool!!!"
1578,"Popular rooftop bar on the 4th floor played club music with heavy bass until 3am. Front desk said sorry and offered ear plugs. The audacity of a business to sell me a (not cheap) room to sleep in and then pump bass into it themselves all night is unbelievable. I could sympathize if it was another place next door, but this is the hotel's own bar. "
1579,"I stayed at Palace between June 28-July 1, 2019. The hotel, particularly the lobby, is stunning. You can feel the weight of history - it is opulent without being overboard - and the location is almost perfect as you are close to everything. I booked the hotel a few months in advance and was assigned to one of the corner rooms on the second floor - far away from the elevator. Having lived in Manhattan, I am used to street noise so did not really see noise as a concern. However, you hear a machine like noise every evening from midnight that is not too loud, but loud enough to annoy you and prevent you from having a restful sleep at one of the most comfortable bed. Little did I know that the staff already knew of the noise when i checked out, when they remarked that they are…"
1580,"The hotel was very well situated for local shops/restaurants, the zoo and the U-Bahn. The bar and accommodation were comfortable and air-conditioned. The breakfasts were excellent. On the down-side, we were supposed to be able to check-in from 3pm but didn't get our rooms till 6:30pm. The pool and sauna were small but pleasant, however they didn't open till after 6pm in the evening and the sauna was not always turned-on. The hotel restaurant (for dinner) was so empty that we're not sure it was open (not a problem, there are so many options to eat out). We were told they have no twin rooms, so the children had to share a double."
1583,"Thankfully I booked a room only for a day use as I would not felt comfortable sleeping in my room overnight. I arrived in Rio from another city early in the morning while departing late that night back to the US so the room was meant to be used as day-use to hold my stuff, shower and get ready to head back home. During the reservation process requested early check in (at 10am since official check in is at Noon). When I arrived they were able to check me in early simply because the room they gave me is probably one they wouldn't give anyone else. It was odd since it had 3 beds in it but that wasn't the worst. It was on the first floor across from the Housekeeping office and a view of the roof. The odor in the room was unbearable but given I was only going to be there to shower…"
1584,"As an Elite Gold Member, I am always looking forward to my next stay at any of their many hotels. Ritz, JW etc... I am on day 2 of my 4 night stay here, and not happy at all.  It's Labor Day weekend, and Their club level is open but no breakfast is being served to their members??? There is loud construction noise over our room since we have been here. The room is out of date, and in desperate need of an upgrade. If they knew all of this was going on, they should of upgraded elite members to more better accommodations for their other short comings.  Just too many issues for a JW to have happen on a holiday weekend.  Not happy with JW...... "
1585,The hotel is conveniently located a few blocks away from L'Arc de Triomphe. Very pretty and small. Clean and friendly right at check-in!  I had left a few belongings in my room upon departure and they were quick to get a hold of me. Quickly they facilitated its return via mail. I travel for business often and more often than not I will leave something behind. Never have I been notified and offered to be assisted. They certainly have gone over and beyond!   I give the hotel a near perfect rating as it was a lot more than I had expected. I was booked here by my colleague who warned me that Paris hotels in this price range often are small and crammed but this place was perfect. 
1586,Great place. Very good location. Wonderful services. The breakfast is outstanding. They have a huge variety or food and also for vegetarians and vegans.  The gym is also really good and has everything one needs for a quick workout.
1589,"The reviewer that stated imagine being in a hurricane shelter said it best but I would like to add a hurricane shelter in a third world country.  Took over 11 hours to get a room.  Only taking cash.  Had to go to ATM 4 times and I imagine at some point they would run out of money.  How is this happening at a property that is charging over $500 a night????  Absolutely horrendous.  No water, comps or anything.  Had to change my clothes twice in a locker room with 20 other women.  I was so excited for this long weekend and I dread leaving my room."
1590,"We stayed here at the end of our Viking river cruise.  The room was large and clean and the bed was very comfortable.  The breakfast buffet was outstanding with a huge selection.  It was close to restaurants and shopping as well.  My only complaint would be that they locked the mini bar on our last day and we had some personal items in there.  Unfortunately, our flight left early in the morning, so we didn’t have time to ask about getting it unlocked."
1591,"Visited Paris and stayed at this hotel. Came from Geneva and got down at Gare de Lyon. This hotel is just outside the station. Lot of eateries just on the hotel street with lit of options. But pricey around 225 euros per night however it is just location location and location. The Metro is 3 minutes walk and it connects all the tour places, Louvre, Arche de triumph etc without changes. You can get down at Arche de triumph and walk to Effiel Tower. Gare de Austerlitz is exactly 10 minutes walk where you get direct train to Versailles. This is the best place to stay in Paris. Rooms are quite small but tidy and has a coffee maker and the elevator is a tiny one though."
1592,"When you walk up to the Whitcomb you see a worn down facade, old carpet, defeated employees and strung out crackheads. You could literally smell disappointment in the air.  After waiting in line and then spending twenty minutes explaining to the front desk person how to spell ""Mark,"" I was given my golden ticket, a key to a room on the 5th floor.  I finally got to meet my room. I walked in, looked around, and immediately googled ""how many people have died at the Hotel Whitcomb?""  The carpet was old, musty and stained. The shower curtain had impressive microbial growth that I told myself was penicillin. Half the lights didn't work. The furniture was worn out in 1987 but remains in the room full of chips and dents.   The air conditioner sounded like a 747 on takeoff and put out…"
1593,Stayed here for 4 nights and only got back yesterday...from the minute we checked in the staff were amazing. Offered a drink whilst we checked in and our bags were taking straight to our room. The receptionist then took us to our room via the 1920 lift which was in perfect working order. The room was lovely very old style but in keeping with the whole style and ambience. The room was quite small but all we needed whilst in Cannes bathroom was very modern. Complimentary water left every day and rooms cleaned to a high standard. Our room overlooked a busy road but was very quiet when patio doors were shut also had a lovely little balcony. Great air con and free wifi. Breakfast was plentiful and the free bar between 6-9 with nibbles  was amazing got to speak to fellow guests and…
1594,"We were recommended this hotel by a travel company in London who booked it and was told this is an excellent place to relax.  The hotel is a lovely place with a nice pool and large bedrooms.  Though I am not criticising the hotel, for the price it is compared to other beach accommodation in SE Asia I think there are a few problems with it.  The restaurant service was terrible. We were waiting 25 minutes to get our drinks on the 1st day. Overall the service is slow and some of the staff seem confused about orders and even delivered to wrong tables. The food itself is was ok though the final night meal we had was nothing special.  I suppose the main issue is the cost. Drinks are almost 4 or 5 times more than other places on the the beach close by and the food at the resort would…"
1595,"Myself and my mum and brother had booked to stay in a suite here from 31st may -3rd June after the end of a 10 day road trip up the west coast of California.  The hotel was booked in January and they took the money straight from my credit card.   On Thursday 30th may at approx 5 pm and 5 hours into our drive there through the big sur I had a phone call from booking.com to say that due to issues with the Wyndhams system they had over booked and cancelled our booking!!  Luckily we were able to stop at Monterey for the night and had time to frantically look for alternative accommodation at such a short notice. Booking.com we’re helpful and as we had particular requirements for what type of Room we needed as I had my 16 year old brother with us,they were able to find an alternative…"
1596,"The location is very good (really close to Hauptbahnhof).   The room was really nice indeed. The outer walls are made of glass and the furnishings are all new. Also, the bathroom is quite large and new on the inside.  The price is not the lowest but it's well worth the average price. Conditions are very good."
1597,Really enjoyed stay.  Hotel really well furnished very clean and staff very friendly and helpful.  We stayed in a double cosy which was small but the bed was queen size and extremely comfy it had everything you needed and unless you have a desire to practice yoga you will have plenty of space!!  A few reviewers said breakfast was not good value.  We did not have breakfast until our last morning because of this but found it to be good value in comparison to the cafe's around.  
1598,"We booked a king patio room for three nights two months before our stay for the sole purpose of having easy access outdoors to take our two small pups outside. I saw more not-great reviews than I would normally like for this hotel on TripAdvisor, but we've stayed in many Kimptons over the years for both work and personal trips and decided to give it a shot out of loyalty. Per usual, I should have listened to the TripAdvisor reviewers. When we first arrived, the front desk could not find our reservation and appeared as though he was going to turn us away until I showed I had the email confirmation. After clearing up that confusion, we were given our key and told to go to the elevator. I thought that was odd given that we were supposed to have a ground-floor patio, but the lobby…"
1600,"This was my first time at a hotel from this group and I got a big deception... The rooms have old furniture and non-cleaned carpets around. I was really impressed when was informed that the WiFi at the rooms, the swimming pool and gym access is payed, not to refer also about the parking (this last one is supposed to be normal...). The hotel was crowded, which means that the reception staff were not enough: phone calls without answer, cues for validation of the parking ticket (every single time I had to go out) and also their attention was compromised, with fast and simple answers... Some bottles in the room's mini-bar were already half consumed and were not replaced before my arrival. Regarding positive aspects, I can only refer to the breakfast (with variety and good quality)…"
1601,"Stayed here 5 nights in a Comfort apartment, i.e. with separate bedroom and a balcony. All is very new, well functioning and spotless clean.  We found it very strange, however, that there was no sink or water taps in the kitchen. So one has to get water from the bathroom. There is a dishwasher though. Apart from that 'drawback' everything was fine. The staff were very friendly and helpful."
1603,"Housekeeping needs training on how to clean and maintain the rooms, specially the bathrooms. Even or one night stay, its important to have an nice clean shower. Finding mold its not pleasant, this is not acceptable in this industry, specially for a well know name as the RADISSON."
1604,"Our flight was at 11pm and we were offered use of a shower for 5 euro.  Horrific, had to hold the shower and the rest of the room flooded soaking our clothes. The hairdryer didn't work then my husband sat on the bench to put his shoes on it collapsed whereby he hit the floor and hurt his back.  Use of shower room should be free as it is extremely basic."
1605,"I stayed with my girlfriend for 4 nights. We were a little bit too early at check-in, but they priories our room. The room was awesome and we even got a little personalized greeting written on the mirror. The hotel is located direct at the Spree river and 2 minutes away from the next metro station and the Warschauer Street, what is totally perfect. The breakfast is awesome and the hotel in general is an absolute beauty. We had an awesome stay. Thanks for this great experience and the great cocktails at the bar."
1606,I was once again very pleased with the attentive service and comfortable and quiet rooms at the Hotel America this past June.The bathrooms are recently remodeled and very chic and contemporary as well as functional. Breakfast is plentiful and served in a comfortable well decorated room. The hotel is very centrally located and we got some very good restaurant recommendations from the front desk. We'll be back on our next visit to the Riviera.
1607,After searching for the perfect apartment/hotel for a 4 day break I found it in this place absolutely stunning apartment very spacious tastefully decorated and very friendly helpful staff made this trip a very enjoyable one 
1608,Old building with areas with carpet. Extremelly small area for breakfast that can not accomodate thirty people confortably.  Few options for breakfast. Not valiable for the price. But very close to subway.
1609,"is clean the bed is super comfy and the mattress amazing, the pillow has to improve a bit, quite small, and some cleanup will be amazing, breakfast is good, toilets clean, is very very good, for 5 years in a row when I go to Paris always stay in this hostel."
1610,"LOCATION You can't beat the location - opposite Praia De Ana beach accessible by wooden steps, a lovely view and handy for sunrise photos!  A 20 min walk to Lagos town centre. AMENITIES A lovely rooftop pool with sun beds and a snack bar for beers and ice- creams with a spectacular view from the top.  It was lovely to spend the afternoons here after a morning on the beach or walking into Lagos. RECEPTION Very friendly reception staff who were happy to help. HOTEL/B&B The rooms were reasonable and accommodated 3 of us comfortably.  Not many other amenities in the room but we didn't really need anything else.  We managed with the drawer and wardrobe space and the room had a safety deposit box operated by a key with a cost at reception. The bathroom was compact but fulfilled our…"
1611,"This hotel in Porto is just placed in the middle of everything: restaurants, shops, cafés, monuments, museums, churches, squares, markets. It is also near the river, so you can go for nice walks and have fun. Its location is the most important feature, the hotel itself is a little bit simple and dated. It was a nice stay though!"
1613,"This hotel is vast.  Even the walk to my room in the North wing seemed endless!  The room was adequate but the real issue was the noise from outside.  Even from the 5th floor there was loud music coming from a nearby bar which went on until 2am.  Therefore I got little sleep.  Apart from that the staff were friendly, the breakfast choice huge but the room was packed with tour groups so was very busy and noisy.  The hotel has a good central location."
1614,"I'll start out by saying we tried to save $$ here, as we splurged on our hotel for the Maui portion of our trip, so I can't hold that on Kauai Shores. It was a standard room. The balcony is nice and large, but we faced the path where all supplies & employees, get brought in/enter. From Food, to Personal Conversations, to Housekeeping supplies, bar supplies. A good 25 rooms faced the same. Additionally, the first two days we arrived, they were doing construction, pounding on the roof and painting our area, so an additional 10 workers literally outside our window. They claim they built the sliding glass door hatch for additional security, but our actual lock didn't work. So really the hatch we had was all and it was built with electrical tape, I repeat, electrical tape. They have…"
1615,"On Dec 8 to the 13th 2016 we stayed at this hotel.  I used 160,000 Marriott points and then also paid $150 per day to upgrade to an Ocean view room.  This was a special trip for a Birthday and I wanted to spend the extra to ensure we had a great room.  We got in late the first night and once the desk clerk had me all signed in she reluctantly gave me a letter from the Dir of Engineering, that there would be re-roofing repairs (noise) every day except Sunday.  We were so tired from traveling from Ft Lauderdale, FL to here that we just took the letter and I told the clerk I had no idea this was going on when I booked this hotel.  Needless to say the noise was awful and sounded like pounding on the pipes right above us...noise started at 9AM till 5PM week days and 10AM till 4 PM on…"
1616,"I used to love coming to the Sea Crest.  My family has been coming since the 70's.  The last few times I stayed were not great, but this was the worse.  I understand the construction, but you should warn guests that a scaffolding will be blocking the partial ocean view - that is not cheap."
1617,"Firstly OK yes the price was great and the location brilliant, just a short walk from Michigan Ave. We booked a room and through booking website received a free upgrade to Deluxe King Suite with sofa bed. Checkin was friendly and efficient, the room on a plus side was roomy, good storage but in desperate need of renovation ( I see the Hotel has started a renovation programme hoping to be completed by the summer) the artex (stippled ) walls were a 1970's retro throwback. There was a kitchenette - fridge, work surface wall cupboard etc but No sink, the cupboards/draw empty, no cutlery, no bowls no plates etc - nothing. No tea/coffee facilities. Luckily we travel with a kettle (and a Nespresso machine - I love my coffee) which was a life saver. There is a Wallgreens a few minutes…"
1618,Stayed for a night only. Single room though clean but very small. No toiletries except for a soap dispenser. The kettle lid in the room was broken. View of the Central mall from the window was fine as well as chance to shop/eat next door.   Restaurant was a disappointment and they really need to do something about it. The guy taking the order did not know anything. Fish Amritsari was just about ok but sabz veg was full of big capsicum pieces and too much of masala. Horrible Gulab jamun took 25 minutes to be served with reminder to all staff there.Had a stomach upset ! Breakfast dosa was overcooked and no taste in chole. Cutlery is always missing on the table. Decor gives a hostel feel and too noisy.Does not have a bar. Check in and out was smooth and Arpit  at front desk gave me…
1619,Very nice hotel and the location excellent. I enjoyed the quiet place; no traffic around. The room was very nice and clean. The negative point was the start hour of breakfast; 8:00 is late if you are there for buisiness
1620,"I stayed at Ruc Hotel for 5 days for a short holiday, the location is fantastic and at most only a 10 minute walk from the beach and town centre. All of the staff were so kind and attentive, and were extremely helpful in organising transfers and providing information about Cannes. Breakfast was lovely, and the room was spacious, clean, and all you could want.  I’ll definitely be visit again next year!"
1621,+++: - standard Ibis hotel you find in every big city - great beds - clean - good breakfast (fresh with local specialties) - location: 10 min. walk to metro - 10 min. to city center with metro - lots of nice restaurants in the area - bar prices are cheap - friendly staff  ---: - for me personal too soft pillows - that's it :-)
1623,"There are many very nice places to stay in downtown Chicago. This is not one of them. The hotel is in a good location, but the place leaves a great deal to be desired. It is old, tired, worn, shabby and needs far more than mere ""upkeep."" It needs a complete remodeling and refurbishing. The two elevators are so slow, there is a 10-15 minute wait. The carpet in the room is ragged and frayed at the edges, as well as stained in several places. The ceiling had significant water stains and chipped plaster. The tub ceramic was not just worn, but chipped and in need of repair. The wallpaper was peeling away from the wall. The woodwork (doors and moldings) was dirty and damaged. The front door lock was in need of repair.  Housekeeping dos not arrive until 5:00 pm (as I was getting ready…"
1624,"Praia D'El Rey is a beautiful resort hotel set on a stunning location near a great beach although the sea is great for surfers it is less so for swimming - so for those with a family of small children it is unsuitable- but still delivers a wonderful location for an early morning walk or late evening stroll. The golf course is one of the best I have played on - thoroughly enjoyed it but what we are not enjoying are the ridiculous prices that the Marriott are charging for coffees, beers and food - if you are not on a breakfast package forget it and as for dinner the cost per head is just so over the top it will ruin your holiday. Nice hotel but not exceptional - if you love golf, play the course but stay somewhere else and enjoy spending your money where it will be well received -…"
1625,"If you arrive in Cannes by bus and you have luggage, consider taking a taxi because the hills are steep.  But once you arrive, you will be captivated by welcoming hosts, a charming boutique hotel, and a warm and friendly atmosphere.  Thank you for your kind hospitality and a lovely stay."
1626,"Decent room. Decent location. Relative to staff at other places we have stayed in Vietnam,  the staff were unimpressive and several times downright rude. Treatment seemed formulaic and procedural.   Trying to leave for the airport,  we were rudely told we could not get in the taxi until room service ""checked our room"" (honestly?) and then they insisted we pay for items we never consumed. Unimpressed."
1627,"Hotel is walking distance from the airport, (although there is a slanting slope). Check in was slow. The room was comfortable, although the separation for the bathroom and bed was a curtain and if you are sharing a room with kids, it is not convenient as there is no privacy. Free Wifi available in the room. Our room had a view of the airport.  Breakfast was really good and plenty of choices.  Eating options are limited to the airport and the hotel restaurant. The food is overpriced at the hotel. Staffs are a mix of cold and friendly. Some reception staff are willing to assist with information you may have and also go the extra mile, but others are happy to tell you they do not know. The nearest train station is next to the airport. Travelling from the hotel to the city center by…"
1628,It was a total anticlimax to all our good experiences at various best Western hotels in Chicago; St Louis.  The leaky flush; rickety bath doors; lack of Internet makes this a horrible choice of stay in Chicago 
1629,"Close to the metro and to the best stores and markets in the city, the reception was very friendly and helpful, I would come back to the same hotel, it was a pleasant experience and rooms were clean and bigger than most hotel rooms in europe."
1630,"Had a chance to stay at Hyatt Gurgaon During the Harley Davidson NH Rally. I will not comment on other aspects of Hyatt as it is a well renowned Brand , but one thing that irked me was the Food Served for the event . it was absolutely rubbish and sub standard . The Rice served were burnt and unchewable. Almost every dish served had not any flavor in it , only the desserts saved the day for them .  I expect world class service in each department if I talk of Hyatt. Get your things right Guys  "
1631,"My first visit to Berlin. Quite a sprawling city. Difficult to pinpoint any specific place as the real centre. This hotel seemed a good bet and did indeed turn out to be a very good choice.  The price was very reasonable for a single room with breakfast. Room was small clean with limited hanging space but adequate for a short stay. Very good breakfast. Breakfast could be taken in the downstairs main restaurant or upstairs with a view over the roof tops. Go downstairs. it's nearer the kitchen and the choice is better.   A nice touch was a free mini bar with a couple of bottles of beer, small botttles of wine & soft drinks that was restocked daily. Also a coffee making machine & kettle.  Free sauna and steam room  It's only a short walk from Zoo station and the Kaiser Whilhelm…"
1632,"The location of this hotel was perfect..right on Las Ramblas. The room was clean and comfortable and the window kept the street noise to a minimum.  Breakfast was excellent every  morning. There was no coffee in the rooms..only tea. The 2 elevators were small and slow. Overall really enjoyed our stay here. Biggest complaint would be the nauseating ""air freshener"" that they use in the lobby!  "
1633,"I don’t normally write negative reviews, but this time I feel like I have to.  The hotel is nice and well located, no doubt.  The shame is the guest service. Diogo, at the front desk has been extremely rude and unhelpful  when I asked for a late checkout. Unable to give another option (booking another room, or paying for a shower room).  Costumer service is the Most important thing in a hotel. I don’t mind a small room, but I think that AT LEAST, one should be prepared to deal with a costumer, when working at a front office. I can’t accept that the guy at the front desk laugh of me at my back ( at least, wait for me to be far enough not to hear it!).  I was only asking some options, as my flight was at 23:40. I wanted to talk to a manger, but it didn’t seem to be an option. Very disappointing.…"
1634,"First, I had booked a.room with 2 beds and we got a room w 1 bed and a sofabed, and they called that 2 beds, and refused to do anything for me.  Then the bellhop said he would bring up our luggage, we waited over a half hour. I found our luggage just sitting downstairs in hall unattended.  I took it and no one even noticed.  The bed was SO hard!!  Room very small but good location.   No blanket on bed either.   "
1635,"We stayed in a studio apartment, it had everything we needed and was just as pictured on booking.com, the bathroom was lovely, really big.   The location was great, there is a courtyard on the street the apartment is on with bars and outside seating, and there are lots of shops (clothes shops) and pastry shops 2 minutes walk from the apartment.   The apartment is very close to the train station, only 5-8 minutes walk, which was extremely convenient for getting to and back to BCN airport. It's also close to a number of well linked metro stations which was really handy for getting to different destinations across the city.   Communication with the company that own the apartment was great, and we were able to leave our bags in the apartment before the check in time, You can't leave…"
1636,"My husband and I stayed at Gorki Apartments in the Fraeulein Ilse room for four nights in July. We loved it! The gorgeous building and the surrounding neighborhood made this hotel 5 stars for us. It is an old apartment building converted into a hotel - clearly a lot of thought and time went into the design elements.. it is beautiful and stylish, yet comfortable.  Pros: -Jonas greeted us with a complimentary craft beer and glass of champagne and then took the time to answer all of our questions about the local dining scene  -Kitchen complete with dishwasher, stove top, Nespresso, electric tea kettle, all the basic necessities to make a simple meal or enjoy your left overs  -Room was very clean on arrival and kept clean by daily maid service  -Tons of storage space to unpack …"
1637,"Rude staff, wifi out of order, very loud music: couldn't sleep until 1:30am. The bunk beds in my room were very close (less than 1 meter), I nearly felt like I was sleeping with the person next to me. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. "
1639,"I don’t recommend the hotel.  Staff are not friendly, rooms are a cubicle, minibar is tremendously expensive. Not worthy at all the rate they charge...  I’m sure it had its glorious days decades ago, but it feels old and outdated now.  Definitely I will not go back!  I’ve stayed in many Hilton Garden Inn that I had a much more pleasant stay. "
1640,"Hotel V Frederiksplein is perfectly okay for a short & reasonable priced stay in Amsterdam, ideally placed for the Van Gogh & Rijksmuseum, a 5 to 10 minute walk away. The room is on the petite side with one side of the bed up against a wall, meaning having to enter the bed from the bottom & climbing over your partner if you wanted to use the bathroom at night, saying that the room was perfectly adequate as a base to explore Amsterdam. The breakfast was a continental breakfast with ham, cheeses, breads, salads & breakfast cereal available, quantity was plentiful & of what you would expect from this type of hotel. Staff were helpful & friendly, always ready with a smile, all spoke excellent English."
1641,"This was by far the worst experience I have had at any Hilton property.  First, I booked a two-room suite online, and did a pre-check in to a 2-room suite on the app.  When I arrived at the hotel at 9pm, I was told at first that they could not locate my reservation.  It turned out, the front desk attendant was misspelling my last name even with my ID in his hand.  Then when I asked if I would be checked into the room I preckecked into, he said yes.  To my surprise, I was handed keys to room 214, and when I went upstairs, it was a regular king room,  not a 2-room suite, and was not the room I prechecked into.  I went to the front desk and ask what happened, and frantically, the front desk attendant said they were having some serious room issues, the room I booked was not…"
1642,"Stay elsewhere.  For the room rate, this hotel is a glorified Days Inn.  Staff is inattentive,  the walls in the rooms are paper thin (you can hear EVERYTHING in adjacent rooms... I'll leave that to your imagination), the rooms are tiny, and the towels and bedding are very poor quality.  Props to the housekeeping staff for a very clean room -- the only positive about my stay.  "
1643,"Worst check-in experience imaginable...and I'm even a Hilton Honors Gold Member!  Ridiculous. 35 minutes to check-in even though there was no one in front of me. Ask to talk to the manager, and a sloppy guy eventually comes round, and truly didn't care. The best part was the lady who finally checked me in, was indeed very nice, BUT SHE SAID SHE HEARS ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE ALL THE TIME!  They just don't put enough staff on she said, especially for the Hilton Honors members. Not sure how they can justify their rates and provide this type of service! Then when I tried to book a car with the bellman for the next morning, I was rudely told to go to the front desk...only to see a huge line when I turned around. (I simply took an Uber...and next time, I'll Uber to a Marriott!)"
1644,"I loved the leitmotiv of this hotel, artworks everywhere which make it a cosy place. The buffet staff is very nice and the food, even though is practically the same every day, is good. Location is excellent, public transportation is really close and walking distance from the main venues is manageable. The WiFi signal is lousy, so don't expect to surf the internet at light speed light. Overall is an excellent choice when visiting Berlin."
1645,"Everything was impeccable (service, interior, quality of food and drinks), though it was very hot in the bedroom. I would recommend keeping an eye on the temperature in the rooms to improve the sleeping conditions. "
1646,"Stayed for two nights in this hotel, which we considered good value for money. Comfortable, if a little dated decor, but very clean generally. We loved the free beers and water provided daily, a great touch. Also fantastic was the smartphone provided - we used this to find our way around with google maps, saving our own data and phone battery life. A really thoughtful addition that we had not seen before in other hotels.  Location is great, a nice walk along the canal, and close to the museum quarter/ Alexanderplatz. The underground (U-Bahn) is literally at the rear of the hotel, very handy to get to the other side of Berlin and the Tiergarten/ Kurfurstendam in about 20 mins.  Staff were professional and helpful when we had a query.  We ate in the Middle Eastern restaurant…"
1647,"I stayed here from Sunday 6th October to 10th.  Firstly, no proper greeting upon arrival. I was unaware of the 35 dollar per day resort fee and was upset to understand that it was for things like free wifi which by the way does not work out by the pool. Upon check in I was given 100 dollar Resort credit and talking to other quests I learned that they received 150 dollars to which the blunt reception staff inform me this is because of who they booked through - which seemed like a cop out as its you giving the credit not the travel company.   I was also billed 88 dollars for breakfast in NOBU which you can’t use the resort credit for but you don’t have another restaurant for you guests to use?? I read a sign saying breakfast was being served in Nobu that day to which I assumed was…"
1648,"We were staying for 3 nights on a city break. We arrived at about 11am expecting to just be able to drop our bags as check in time was 3pm but both our rooms were ready. We came back into the lobby and went to talk to the concierge about booking ho ho bus and other trips etc. He was excellent and within half an hour everything we wanted to do was booked with other things and restaurants suggested. Fabulous service. The hotel is just a 5 minute walk from Alexanderplatz where buses stop and there is a teain station. There are trams which run from outside the hotel (didn't try these). Breakfast every morning was substantial with lots of choice and everything was very fresh.  The rooms were beautifully kept, clean and comfortable. Very comfortable bed and the bathroom was modern and…"
1649,Have always been a loyal Marriott guest but after our experience at this property am definitely no longer feeling that way. Don't seem like to care much about service or cleanliness here. Lobby is nice but one does not sleep in the lobby 
1650,"Our group of 8 stayed there.  The apartments are named after famous composers.  Very spacious, with stove, fridge, microwave and large bath/shower.  There is not lift, but that did not present a problem for us.  It was easy walking distance to Rewe (~1 block), and a parking garage was just down the street.  We easily walked to the river and all over that part of Berlin.  We would stay there again."
1651,"The location on the Ribeira is excellent. Easy to walk across the bridge to all the port houses. Steep hill behind the hotel to reach the rest of the town.  Unfortunately the Ribeira itself is a tourist trap full of low quality restaurants and bars. We had two disappointing meals here.  ** The front desk staff are very professional, helpful and friendly. **  The views from our room across the river were wonderful.   Unfortunately the room itself (river view studio) was more basic than we'd expected.  It has a row of cabinets which contains a dishwasher, sink, microwave, fridge and hob. We didn't use the kitchen.   There was a fold out table attached to the wall and one chair.  The large feature lamp had no power outlet nearby and must just be for show.  The AC worked well and…"
1652,I stayed here twice in June. First for three nights and again for one night. Rooms were comfortable 760 and 330. Both only had showers. Breakfast was excellent with a wide variety and they will cook you an omelette. There is also a terrace outside where you can eat breakfast in warm weather.   Bar is ok but staff need more training in making cocktails. Lobby restaurant is good for a quick snack or light meal. Wilson’s the hotel restaurant did not wow me but perfectly acceptable and I enjoyed the seasonal white asparagus.   My wife enjoyed the pool and the staff were patient and professional. There is parking overnight for 25 euros. I would definitely stay here again. 
1653,"Had been staying in Hoi An and decided to book this resort for last 3 nights of our trip to relax and paid extra to stay in a beachfront bungalow. The bungalow was right on the beach which was great but that’s it. We felt that the bungalow needed to be refurbished only to be told that they were 12 months ago. To have a shower was difficult trying to climb over the bath and water just spills all over the floor and leaves a big puddle and is very slippery. You need all the towels to mop it up. My husband made muddy footprints in the bathroom and after the room finally got cleaned the footprints were still there.  As for the breakfast, what can I say but does not really cater at all for westerners. Spaghetti bolognaise, potato bake, creamy broccoli is not what I call westerner…"
1654,"I was really disappointed with the way they handled our booking. We were booked to stay for 3 nights in the $25 a night rooms when my partner fell ill and we were not able to travel, I contacted the hotel straight away to let them know we will have to delay our booking by a few days until he got better. They informed me I would have to pay again for the room under their cancellation policy with agoda,  which I complained about so they told me they would try and sell my room for the nights then I wouldn't have to pay? They said they managed to sell two nights but we would have to pay $25 for the other night, we accepted unsatisfied but couldn't be bothered to argue with them more. We confirmed with them the day before that it was OK for us to come the next day which they…"
1656,"My husband and I chose Lotza Studios for a long awaited month off. We had been in e-mail communication with Gianna (who we assumed to be the manager) prior to arriving and she had been very helpful with her responses.  On arrival, we had arranged to be dropped off by taxi in the nearby carpark, as one has to travel by foot (or donkey!)  through most of Finikia where Lotza Studios is located. We were met by a young local girl who walked us to Lotza, showed us our studio and  pointed out how the hot water worked. We asked would we be seeing Gianna the next day, however we were not sure she understood as she didn't really respond. However, we were not too worried, as we assumed we'd see Gianna at some stage during the next day.  We didn't see Gianna once during the entirety of our…"
1657,"Hotel was really good, but the best things that we remeber was the bed, very very confortable.Bathroom was also very confortable, with a great shower. Those things repaid the distance from the centre."
1658,my wife & me syayed in hotel neya for two nights during last april. the staff wasn't very impresive nor too friendly. room is normal for a 4 star hotel yet very dark water preasure in the shower was very low. the hotel's parking is a nightmare for whoever own a larger car then a smart...
1659,"Firstly make sure you have the right hotel as our Travel Agent made the same mistake as us when looking at reviews. The other Enotel is 10 minutes walk away. Hotel very clean and well kept, very boutique. This hotel let us down on food in general. Breakfasts were OK and no real issues. However, dinners take you back 25 years. We are not fussy eaters and have never complained about food wherever we have been. Choice was very limited, not especially appetising unless you like everything thrown together for you in a salad. There was usually one prepared meat dish and one fish and two others cooked by the chef - none were up to 4 star standard. People around us had eaten out as we did on one occasion due to the poor choice.The staff were surly and the restaurant was run on a strict…"
1660,"Excellent location minutes walk from public trunsportation 10 minutes walk from europe center Large comfortable room with bathroom & shower room (not too big) Breakfast varied and satisfying Excellent WIFI signal input even in rooms Staff speak English and willing to help There is no kettle and there is no coffee area in the room City taxes are very high 5%, some hotels are reducing some of the taxes"
1661,"Disappointed that they did not indicated that the pool was out of commission prior to booking. I needed pool for some rehabilitation exercises. They also did not assist me in finding another comparable hotel at the same price, even though I am a Hilton Honors member. Very disappointing. "
1662,"My husband and I visited this hotel over the Easter period and had a brilliant time. The hotel room, though small, was adequate for our needs. It had a fridge, a TV which had BBC and CNBC in English. It also had many other foreign languages on the TV so would satisfy a lot of people. The fridge was excellent as we kept lots of bits there. I've stayed in many other higher class hotels and they don't provide fridges so it was good to have one - very handy. The Wi-Fi was the only thing we had problems with but I solved it by using my own data.   The hotel is brilliantly situated right in the centre of Cannes, across the road from the station and round the corner from the beaches, and other sightseeing places. The hotel is extremely clean (believe me - I'm fussy!) and the staff are…"
1663,"Recently stayed for four days in total at the Holiday Inn Alexanderplatz. Booking and reservation process handled professionally and efficiently by Messrs.Sebastian and Frank. Warm welcome, room upgrade, all most satisfactory. Room was amply sized, clean, bed comfortable and pillows exchanged speedily to our comfort preference. The hotel is located very close to the famous Alexanderplatz, restaurants, shops, trains, buses, trams, all within easy walking distance. In short a very good choice for a lovely holiday in Berlin. Thank you again Sebastian and Frank !"
1664,"Hotel de Flore is absolutely wonderful: clean, quiet, perfectly located.  The rooms are recently renovated, with the best shower I ever used. Hotel provides breakfast (12 euro per person), which is very satisfying.    Hotel de Flore is very close to Sacre Coeur - La Basilique du Sacré Cœur de Montmartre, Mulen Rouge, Place Pigalle, and other great attraction that may be on your list; however, it is located outside the main tourist path, and it makes you feel very Parisien while you are there experiencing small cafes and shops like them, French, do.    The closest (2 min walk) metro is Lamarck — Caulaincourt (line 12).  Paris metro is very accessible and easy to master - it takes you everywhere!  The Hotel stuff (thank you Syrine, Anne and all!) is very friendly and helpful; they…"
1665,"Quite disappointed with this hotel mainly due to their customer service. I felt customer service was not up to Sofitel hospitality standards. Didn't feel most staff were too accommodating or friendly. I'll list a few examples. When I approached the bell man counter to drop off my luggage he did not seem too interested to assist me. Also as I was talking to him, his cell phone rang and he went ahead and answered a call. Wasn't sure if it was work related but still found it rude to just interrupt our conversation to answer a call. Some of the staff at the Sofitel club lounge seemed annoyed when you would ask them for something.  Was also a bit concerning that I was given a new room key card (for different rooms too) by front desk without being asked for identification. I didn't…"
1666,"Rooms in poor state and in need of updating. Most rooms face central court which had noisy extractor fans going on all day and night. Bathrooms grimy and not cleaned properly. Buffet breakfast was chaos and far too busy to be enjoyable. Would have given one star but staff has been friendly and polite hence gave another star. Also the location of the hotel helped. Very centrally located and close to beaches, shops and restaurants."
1667,"Maybe there just aren’t enough hotels in Salvador so there’s not enough competition, but Wish Hotel is an absolute disaster from the moment we arrived.   Service at reception was abysmally slow (it took 30 minutes from arrival to checkin and get to our room), spa was locked up during open hours and front desk had no idea who to call, and rooms were dated and worn down.   Would advise against staying here. "
1669,"Hilton Grand Vacations promised me a Hawaiian village and gave me what seemed like the equivalent of Venice beach.  Not “resort-close” to beach e.g. beach access on hotel property, but you must walk blocks through crowds and retail areas to get to the beach.   Rooms are small. Beds are full size and you can only double up small children.  Does not comfortably fit 4 adults as Hilton grand vacations promised.  Hotel said they’d provide blankets and pillows for sleeping on the floor. Really????  Not a great view unless you upgrade for around $70 per night.  Parking is rough getting out. Extremely High slope on exit so risky to lower sitting cars.  No vending machines for water on floors.  You must go to lobby restaurant to get water. No spa services.  The luau and boat ride offered…"
1670,"Hotel is 20 minute walk (alongside a polluted and smelly tributary) from The Bund. There are metro stations 10 minutes walk away but the hotel staff less than helpful with directions. Breakfast choices not great and first time I had the misfortune to discover the temperature at which the Chinese serve a cooked breakfast. Traffic noise from the main road 20m from hotel is incessant 24 hours a day so you have to close the window but the air con is so ineffective you start to melt in the room so you have to open the window ... In a city as vast as Shanghai, there must be much better places than this to stay."
1671,We asked for a proper double bed by email a week before as I had read trip advisor and had seen that they usually use two beds pushed together which I really dont like.  I was very pleased when they put us on the fourth floor with a proper bed.  The rooms are very small and it is a weird set up with the shower being inside the bedroom.  The hotel only provides shower gel and no complimentary other bits and bobs.   Bath towels are very small and no robe is provided or extra large towels.    The room was clean but very cramped.  The breakfast was excellent and so were the staff.  Great location too.  For a 4 star rating the room let the side down.
1672,I can't believe this can happen to a paying customer in America. They were literally banging the wall of my room with hammers etc from the room next door until 11pm and then again at 6AM.  The room and breakfast was paid by my company - so I did not accept their apologies and offer for discounts etc. Was very angry about lack of sleep.  Front desk said the hotel was over booked so they had to offer me such a room next to construction. Well they set me up - and should be thankful that I did not call 911 for such burglary like noise.
1673,"If you'd like to pay quite a lot of money to be disrespected and get an awful service then, this hotel is what you're looking for. Just to give a glimpse of what was my experience at this place.  My problems started already during check-in. I arrived at night after a long journey, hoping to get a room as soon as possible, make some basic preparations for my next day and take some rest, I'd need to be sharp, the next day would be an important one at work for me.   Due to my credit card limit, ""I like to keep them relatively low"", I've asked do split the bill and charge into two different cards, business as usual right? No, not at this place. I was told that it was not possible. I was forced to call the bank also card company trying to sort it out, but of course, there was not to…"
1674,The hotel is really nice. Is close to Alexander plaz and Potsdamer platz.  You can find a lot of cafes and restaurants the area . The subway is close. The rooms are big and clean. The personal was so nice. 
1675,"We paid 350$ w/ tax for just one single night.  The carpet was worn out in the room. The view was over a wall.  We arrived Saturday at 9 am. The room wasn’t ready, which is obviously fine and we stored our luggage. We only found out from the evening shift person when we came back to the hotel at 9 pm that they offered free bike to tour the city. We were alone that morning at check in and I believe I could have been told that. When you have people pay such expensive prices, the stay must be perfect. I explained all this at check out and I was told a manager would reach out to me. I am still waiting. Disappointing. This hotel is not worth the money. For 180$ a night that would have been fine but not for 350$!"
1676,"Nice hotel with shuttle bus into Funchal.  Rooms comfortable and very clean. Staff very friendly. Food seems to be the problem.  Jelly and mousse was on menu every day along with cake but if cake ran out, which was usually the case, it was replaced with more mouse. Not really up to standard of 4 *. Some of the cooked food not of good quality but breakfast was exceptionally good. Cleanliness was very good. "
1677,"Stayed here with very high expectations, and was disappointed.  The rooms are very nice, and the hotel lobby is beautiful, but there were many small details where I felt that the service fell short of my expectations.  For example, we ate at their courtyard bbq when we first arrived.  This is a fixed price, all you can eat meal.  We left hungry, simply because it was impossible to get served.  All the other tables seemed to be getting the items they requested, while we made requests repeatedly both to our server and to the chef at the grill.  Another issue was that the AC in the room we stayed in was unreliable.  At some times in the day it was quite cool, and at other times it was unable to cool the room adequately.  This was a problem because repeatedly we would wake up in the…"
1678,"Look at the view of the room we got despite having stayed previously and booking 3 months in advance. There was no view, and room was dank and claustrophobic even though my file says I'm claustrophobic.  Tv was not working.  Switched rooms for night two but I had to beg.  They lost my spa reservation (the my told me it was for next week). They rarely picked up the phone. There is no more Nobu (it moved to Eden Roc). There is a Mexican knockoff restaurant there now.  The pool party had no energy.  It's like they have given up now that it will be condos.  Avoid.  "
1679,"""luxurious comfort and unparalleled service"" is the description they use.  NOT EVEN CLOSE.  Lost power- so no A/C, no wifi, no hot shower, no TV ... and no compensation.  ""its not their fault"".     This is not a 4 start hotel - don't kid yourself and don't stay there.  Absolutely awful."
1680,"Stayed at Ibis Styles Alexanderplatz for a weekend in Berlin. This is a nice clean hotel at a strategic location, just across the street from Alexanderplatz - one of Berlin's main tourist areas.   Pros are more meaningful: Nice and clean, great location (quiet spot just in front of the main excitement), inexpensive, free WiFi.  Cons are less meaningful: Somewhat small and crowded bathroom, weird entrance to the hotel with small reception desk located in the breakfast room, cold (only) breakfast, only a single elevator (lift) which is sometimes occupied,  Altogether seemed like a very good choice. Would certainly recommend."
1681,"Compared to other HIE I stayed, this one is below expectation: 1. Front desk: During check-in, I was given a room that the previous guest hadn't checked out yet. Fa-piao not provided promptly. 2. Cleanliness: Room smell with a mix of toilet stench, cigarette smoke and moisture."
1682,"This hotel was everything you need for a city break in Paris.  It was clean and modern having been recently refurbished. The rooms are small but functional. Comfy beds, hot power shower, plenty of plugs for charging cameras/phones after a day exploring.  The reception staff were really friendly and spoke good English.   The hotel was round the corner from a supermarket which had all the basics including fresh bread which we had for breakfast. We didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on the food.  The hotel is around the corner from the Rebulique metro station which connects you to all the main tourist attractions.  All in all a great stay and would definitely use this hotel again if I came back to Paris. "
1683,"I stayed this hotel two weeks ago.  The staffs were v nice and helpful.  In my original planning,  I have booked a room for two nights.  However, since my trip have been changed,  I have to cancel one night booking.  They didn't charge me any cost even I decided to cancel the second night booking.  It is very considerate.   As for the room:   Downside the flush system was not working and wifi signal is too weak.  Upside:  Room condition is acceptable in such price level.  Location is good and just nearby metro station (around 2 mins by walking)."
1684,"This hotel is in a really good location in Berlin-Mitte, right on a U8 stop. There are plenty of good cafe's and restaurants nearby. The hotel is both cool and functional, the staff was very nice and accommodating, the check-in check-out was super fast and smooth. The lobby area has a bar and sitting on these cool high couches. The idea of the place is that you will not be disturbed, so if you want your room to be cleaned you have to put up a sign, which we liked. you get a key not only to your room but to the floor and entire room area which we loved, because it gives an additional sense of security. The room itself is cool, the bed is in this massive structure and everything is in good size, no redundant mini bar or any other stuff hotels put to up the price. But they were…"
1685,DONT!!  My room is directly parallel to the El.  The room is SO noisy.  And the front desk was most unhelpful.  I begged for a different room.  I was told there wasn’t one.  But curiously i would be able to book another online. The lobby is crazy noisy too.  Find another hotel
1686,"I wish I didnt stay here. If I didnt have my 1 year old with me I would've just leave and look for a different place after seeing the second room. It's winter and I want to make sure there is a roof over our heads. I requested only for a tub and a crib and maybe room with a view. I understand how 'requests' works, that they may or may not fulfill it. The crib is essential and asks in advance just to make sure if the 'requests' can be accomodated, they said yes. I was under the impression that all rooms is a shower/tub combination as they have it on their site.   Our first room in the 14th floor looks at a parking lot and a street corner. It was ok but it didnt have a tub, I needed one for our little one. So I went downstairs, to talk to the front desk for a room with a tub. It…"
1687,"Dated decor in bedrooms and lack of information in the rooms.  It is a brisk uphill 10 minute walk from Marques de Pombal metro (and I walk quickly!).  I felt the €7.50 charge for guests to use the pool and spa was mean spirited.  Staff were variable, mostly friendly and helpful but a few in the breakfast area less so. Breakfast was OK but not outstanding. On the plus side it is near to the shopping centre which has a wide range of restaurants, and we found the room comfortable and quiet."
1689,"We had a good time in this amazing and cozy hotel! The breakfast was incredible!  Delicious crepes and croissants every single day! The staff was very helpful, speaking in English and French. The hotel is just 4 minute walk from Pigalle metro station.  "
1690,"The rooms and beds are very comfortable, the breakfast is extensive and the lobby has a trendy feel.  Service is good enough.  Best of this boutique is the location, in the middle of the Mitte district.  You find many charming little restaurants, bars, cafe's galleries all within walking distance and it makes you have a proper Berlin experience.  If you want Starbucks and McDonalds this is not for you!"
1693,"Great hotel , excellent price for business travel less than a 100 a night including decent breakfast. Very clean , good service, nice location. It was a little warm in the room but opening s window was not an option- some traffic. Other than that- good value. "
1694,This is a hotel that should be rated excellent but lacks a few things that would get that rating. We had two connecting deluxe boulevard rooms. The rooms were a bit cramped and not designed very well as hotel rooms despite the fact that they are lovely. (I'd hate to see the smaller rooms.) The air conditioning controls are almost hidden along a black wall; good luck finding them in the dark. There is no nightlight in the bathroom except to turn on a whole set of nightlights that runs throughout the room. There are hardly any drawers to allow you to unpack. There are no clocks in the room unless you ask for one. The shower is excellent and easy to operate. The television could have used something like YouTube internal to the TV system -- my kids were bored with the TV because…
1695,"Enjoyed the location and vibe of the hotel during my 2 week stay.  The free coffee and the co-working area made it a 'social' and lively place to be when working alone and being in a new city.  The studio was well enough equipped with kitchenette and supplies, and spacious and comfortable.  It was a blessing to have 'free' laundry due to maintenance but do feel that this is not stipulated clearly enough at check-in for pricing or on the website.  The free bike use is great too and it would also be good if reception highlighted what items for kitchenette they make available to guests (e.g. dish soap as I didn't know this so bought my own unnecessarily).  Although I considered this still expensive a stay, by Amsterdam standards for what you get it's good value for money and I…"
1696,"We have just had an enjoyable holiday but there is no way that objectively this hotel can be rated 4/5 star when compared to the competition in Funchal and elsewhere. Main restaurant is pretty much average as buffets go, and the opportunities to eat in the specialist restaurants are very limited. We were very impressed by the attitude of the staff in bars and restaurants - always helpful and cheerful. Some rooms can be very noisy until late at night."
1697,Hotel is very clean. Friendly staff. Breakfast is reasonable. Rooms are v warm. AC unit could be more powerful. Hotel is on a busy street. Also beside the tramline and only a short journey into the centre.
1698,"I'm very conflicted about writing this, my husband and I loved the place, it's in a beautiful location, restaurants were really great, pool are beautiful , all good!  Here's the problem...we had reservations made from quite a while, all we wanted was a garden view, I'm not the kind of traveler that needs a lot out of a hotel room ( give me clean, courtesy and a descent service and I'm happy ) so as we are checking in we were told they overbooked and all they had available was a standard room ( I was disappointed  but ok ) as we walk into the room my room view was nothing but a rooftop whee I could see some garbage, a delivery door and nothing else!!! Tears rolled down my face, since I'm not that kind of person to cry over things like this, my husband was very upset! We decided…"
1699,"Distant from the center but well served, just a few meters from the subway n ° 50 and 51 and from the tram n ° 13. From the airport it is easy to reach. Breakfast price / quality good. Friendly staff. For metrebus transport it is preferable to make the GVB day ticket."
1700,"A nicely decorated hotel in a terrific location, close to most sites. The staff were excellent, very patient, polite and helpful with tired travelers . However, the room they gave us was the size of a wardrobe. One of us had to sit on the bed or go into the bathroom so the other could move around.We are not large people so I would hate to see how two fat people would manage. Come to think of it, the lift was also tiny you could only fit two big people in there at a time. We asked for a larger room the following night, the one they gave us was better - still not large, but we could both move around at the same time. Restaurant is good ."
1701,"Can you believe that is possible to have pets (dogs and cats) accepted in that hotel? Yes, that is a fact. So, it's important to say that you can rest in the same bed used earlier by one dog. Then, welcome to the animal environment closed in a single room."
1702,"Perfectly good hotel for the price range . Near metro stations and Sagreda Familia. Our room although quite small was fine , very quiet and comfortable bed. Lovely big shower cubicle. Breakfast was your standard fare . Didn't quite get the scrambled egg as is was nearly white in colour but plenty else to choose from. Staff were friendly and helpful,"
1703,Nicely updated boutique hotel with very good staff and convenient to walk to Montmartre and Moulin Rouge. Air Conditioning was outstanding as temps were over 100 when we visited. Separate bedroom for our daughter with twin beds was nice.
1705,"reception area extremely small, lifts to rooms hold 2 people snugly. Our double room (no. 35) was clean, smart but extremely small and claustrophobic. Toilet and shower room partitioned with glass! so very little privacy. This would have made a perfect single room. Dining area is held in the building next door. On the plus side, the staff were very pleasant and helpful. The breakfast was tasty and plentiful and the location seemed perfect to us. I recommend the hotel but only if the room is larger the room 35."
1706,"We are old time Ojai Valley Inn patrons and fans, been coming here for years, and were so excited see what had been done with renovations to the place. That excitement waned after walking in the door of the main lobby. We were so stunned and disappointed -- the new decor is very modern, austere, and completely out of sync with the architecture of the buildings, and with what one expects to come to in Ojai. It's such a shame that it wasn't given a remodel befitting of a historic landmark, a Wallace Neff for goodness sake! I can appreciate and understand wanting to refresh and redecorate, but to completely strip buildings of ALL their character and charm, is so very sad. They really should have consulted with a designer/architect who understands and gets period architecture, and…"
1708,"I visit Berlin often and this is the best hotel I've stayed at. The service was excellent, every member of staff was friendly and helpful, very convenient location very close to U-Bahn,S-Bahn and tram services,, rooms were clean and well decorated. Very much worth the price,great value for money."
1709,"The selection offered for breakfast was better than most hotels. Indoor spaces were inviting. We appreciated the location as it was close to our conference center, but also to the zoo and aquarium for our child, and a few metro stops from the Museum of technology. "
1710,Stayed recently for three nights. On arrival on a warm day our room was excessively hot having been soaked in the sunshine all afternoon with the curtains open. Tried to cool it down however the aircon was very inefficient. Also there was no water except in the mini bar which was extra. Front desk arranged for maintenance to attend which he did swiftly however he could not improve it barely a gentle breeze coming out and not cool either.  The desk manager tried to explain that in Germany they cannot have efficient aircon unlike other countries however reception area was very cool. Other buildings too seemed to have efficient aircon. Also WiFi very poor less than 2mbs.   Hotel responded to another review I left via a booking site saying water tea coffee not a standard within our…
1711,"Excellent Staff! Very gracious and always helpful whenever asked. Excellent location.  Close to metro Fine restaurants very close - including Parc aux Cerfs-my facorite!!!, Bistro Du Dome, Le Select, and La Coupole"
1713,"Stayed here on a stag do, the location is great as it’s right next to the train station. The rooms were alright, kind of like a hostel but with your mates. I would probably stay here again, just watch out for the folk selling their wares out the front if you catch my drift. The staff were all helpful and friendly."
1714,"Perfect location for our long weekend in Berlin. So near the U-bahn and easy to find.  Great staff, so helpful and pleasant. Nice breakfast. Maybe the hotelrooms need to be freshened. But we will definitely be back."
1715,First visit 2years ago when very pleased with entire experience. This time upgraded to a suit which although very spacious didn't provide bathroom slippers and the towels were rough and very thin. No walk in shower and the bath was difficult to get in and out of and the area where the shower was showed signs of mould in between the tiles. Restaurant had a large selection for breakfast but the fresh fruit was under ripe no mangoes or papayas. The hot food was poorly presented and often not well cooked. The coffee was appalling in the restaurant and when asked if could have an espresso was told would be a extra charge. Had dinner 3 times and generally quite good and all the staff friendly and helpful. Have used Porto Bay hotels on a number of occasions but this one seems below…
1716,"A great place to stay, just between AirPort Schoeneveld and the city center. Public transport is at 20 meters from the hotel. Penta had its own unique style and feel-at-home proposition which makes it stand out from other hotels. Breakfast gives a rich choice of food and drinks. Personel is really friendly and fluent in English. Recommended. "
1717,"Very nice and clean hotel with friendly staff. Rooms are a bit smaller than it looks at the photos but it's not a problem. Great location with loads of bars, restaurants and metro nearby. The only disadvantage are thin walls. You can hear people having a shower or even laughing  in the room next door. However, in general, would honestly recommend :) "
1718,"Very good location, close to the metro. Excellent beds and a very friendly and professional service.  The rooms may not be huge, but well above the Parisian standard. I'll certainly be back to stay here."
1719,"The room was terribly small, looks nothing like the ones they show you on the website (i am talking about the picture they show for the lowest category).  I have honestly not seen a room this small in Asia since I moved out here from New York.  Even for New York city this would be considered a tiny room. The view strangely is not good considering I was on 63rd floor, the window faces 90 degrees a wall of other windows due to the architecture.  I got a room with a ""bund view"" but only if you stand in a corner and crane your neck.    Upon check in, the receptionist told me they ""upgraded"" to me a newly renovated room.  What that means is in reality a smaller room with a smaller bed.  I requested a change, and he told me the entire hotel is booked and full.  yet when I go online in…"
1720,"We had a very good time for the 3 days and the hotel exceeded our expectations, very beautiful modern room, clean, well appointed. Very nice helpful staff. The breakfast was excellent and the views from the 24th floor are superb. There were small minor issues with the shower but  overall we had a really good time in this hotel and we higly recommend. Taxi to city is 10-12 euro. Beach is at walking distance. Tram 2 min walk"
1721,"Chosen from the website and being the first visit to Porto not sure of the geography of the city. It turned out to be just a touch too far from metro and town centre but we are good walkers so that did not trouble us. The hotel was deemed four star but was more budget. Toiletries were sparse, room small. Breakfast a big disappointment. In a country bursting with fresh fruit we had only water melon (mushy), kiwi (hard and sour) orange slices. The cold meats were poor quality, watery and with the appearance of having been kept too long in polythene, or maybe tinned. Cheese too was 'plastic'. Bread was good but on the morning we breakfasted early it did not appear until we were leaving. The only hot option was scrambled agog, which I tried once, finding it watery and with hard…"
1722,"Incredible hotel.  Stone walls, uber modern bathrooms, extremely quiet.  Excellent location walking distance to Notre Dame, the Louvre, etc.  The staff really makes the place, as well.  There are lots of restaurants and bakeries within walking distance.  The hotel serves breakfast and the rooms have a coffee service."
1723,Room was very spacious & extremely clean. We didn’t eat at the hotel as we were out & about a lot. Bar staff were slow to serve you but comparing to other places I think this may be the German way.  Ideal location to walk to many attractions. Beds extremely comfortable. Would definitely stay again. 
1724,"Reserved through Hotels . com and charged by Hotels.com. On arrival told all was in order. On departure, last second, told that Hotels.com had not paid and I must pay. Charged again for hotel. Still in dispute. told to ""call back tomorrow"" etc etc.  Not worth the aggravation."
1725,Great hotel. Very central. Nice comfortable beds. Friendly helpful staff. Nice breakfast. Lovely courtyard garden that you can sit out in for breakfast or drinks at night. Only minus was broken air con with very hot weather however we were informed of this at check in and provided with a fan and water.
1726,"Nice and cosy hotel near Kurfürstendamm. It is a Radisson Hotel, so the standard is good. Nice clean rooms of a good size and very friendly staff! Good international breakfast. They offer room service but We did not try it. Good hotel and good price "
1727,We loved the location but the room was filthy and very dated. Toothpaste all over the bathroom walls. Essentially it was gross. We took pictures and showed the front desk and they acted put out although we were moved to a somewhat better room. After 4 day stay we were happy to check out.
1728,"Just stayed here during their first week open.  We were extremely disappointed to find that this property shares a beach with the Disney Resort which is next door.  And despite the website's mention of an ""adult beach,"" I found out at check-in that there is no such thing.  There is only one beach.  The resort does have a barrier to keep the Disney guests on their side of the sand, but the water is shared and Disney has A LOT of guests who make A LOT of noise.  Snorkeling was out of the question.  Service was spotty, but we expected that in their inaugural week - that will improve.  If you're looking for Hawaiian decor or environment, this is not the place for you.  It has a sleek, modern high-rise look that is more California than Hawaii.  No Hawaiian prints for employee…"
1729,The hotel is situated some 20mins from airport (direct bus; aerobus 3€50 ticket/pax valid for 24h) and some 10mins away from Lisbon historical city centre (again you can use the aerobus ticket). The staff is nice and helpful. Just like any ibis hotel you know what you are expecting; clean room with a super comfy bed. 
1730,"Superb service, the owners are extremely welcoming and friendly. The hotel is situated right in the heart of Berlin, with many galleries and restaurants around the area. Beautiful mural illustrations add artistic value to the hotel. The place provided quiet, peaceful atmosphere that let us relax and get a good night's sleep."
1731,I made my reservations for Villa Florence last January.  I was never told that Kuletos was not there anymore and that the hotel is under construction.  The front lobby is makeshift and not conducive to any gathering or amenities.  My room was on the second floor on the corner of Powell and O'Farrell. Avoid that room as it is so noisy it is hard to sleep plus the black out curtains do not cover the windows.
1732,"hi all, could anyone tell me how to get to the apartments from the airport, I've emailed Lisbon Colours but no reply, I've heard that it's difficult to get around using taxis so would love if anyone could give information on how they got to the apartments.  thanks in advance."
1734,"One of two absolute 5* hotels in Berlin, everything about it was great. The service, the quality of the hotel, the architecture, the breakfast. It’s pricey but good. It’s situated in a relatively quiet part of the city and in the evening, it’s quite dead outside. There is a restaurant about 50 yds away but that’s about it. If you want to stay where the action is, go to Alexanderplatz but this place suits me"
1735,"Reservation booked through CruCon as Azamara Cruise package.  Got to hotel and had wrong dates.  Hotel prepaid, so was not sure if their dates were correct since they told me that they would charge for an additional day because my fligt left so late at night.  I explained that I was checking out in the AM and would not need the additional day and would like a refund.  They could not issue refund until they talk with sales staffl, which was not going to be in until a day after I left.  I said that was OK and we could resolve it then.  Sales staff gave me email and promised to email me with information once they spoke with Sales rep.  When I arrive home, I noticed on my charge card that they had charged me for the night I was sure was paid for.  SoThis according to hotel was three…"
1736,"Hotel Paris B  A hidden gem in Paris, this was my first stay at the Hotel Paris Bastille Boutet,simply stunning! An amazing,delightful intimate hotel with incredible staff, friendly, welcoming and super efficient making everything effortless and enjoyable. Modern with a beautiful swimming pool, sauna, steam room all of which is open from 7am.  Situated within a 15 minutes stroll of Bastille in a quiet residential area with ease of access to the rest of Paris by Metro and buses. Nearby is the bustling Marché d’Aligre, plenty of shops, restaurants and cafes without the hassle of crowds. My room was of a good size, spotless, light beautifully decorated and very ""chic"" with heavenly bed and pillows, Nespresso machine, tea making facility, flat screen TV, mini-bar, plenty of storage.…"
1737,"Stayed for 5 nights without breakfast. Room was spacious with large double bed, plenty of wardrobe space, big desk and tv and fridge (mainly full of mini bar drinks). Hand and body wash was provided, as well as a small body lotion. Extra pillow in cupboard and free safe box which we used throughout the stay.  There didn’t seem to be WiFi; if there was we weren’t told how to access it. There was also no phone/ internet signal at all in our room which was awkward.  There was a loud group of men one night staying in the room opposite ours but other than that the hotel was generally very quiet.  The hotel is directly inside the station building so really convenient and easy to find. The hotel also provides a travel ticket so we enjoyed free bus, tram, and trains in Berlin, which…"
1739,"This hotel is beautiful BUT the customer focus is certainly not 5 star.  It is 0 star.  Coffee at breakfast arrives 37 minutes after it is ordered.  No place for the hotel guests to sit in the lounge or the restaurant for 6 hours a day on the weekend because ALL seats are booked out for high tea.    When you book a room at a hotel you also rent the hotel's lounge or at least a small part of it.  But to squeeze in a few more high tea customers, the hotel guests have to go and pay to sit at a restaurant outside the hotel.  5 star? No.  It's no comparison to the Rosewood our hotel Kulm or other 5 star hotels where they value hospitality over greed.  And the management couldn't give a damn.  My friend complained and his complaint it was met with disdain or was it disinterest? We…"
1740,Stayed four night. Staff as usual is friendly and helpful. Rooms are somewhat small. There is no provision for making tea or coffee and no fridge in the room. Hot water is available near reception but it is not convenient for morning cuppa. In any case good and convenient place to stay. Surely recommend.
1741,"This hotel was perfect for our trip to Paris. The location is perfect, with fantastic bars, cafes and restaurants really close, you will be spoiled for choice. We didn’t book breakfast as we wanted to try different places and we were not disappointed.   We had a superior room and it was worth the extra to have a bit more space. Our room was spotless and kept spotless throughout our stay.   We loved the area and couldn’t wait to get back each night after long days sightseeing. We got a taxi to and from the airport, it is a flat free of €55 euro and worth it. Just make sure you go to the official taxi rank and not the guys in the airport.   The only thing I would have to say negative about our stay was that the lift was quite smelly, but it’s a minor thing and wouldn’t stop us…"
1742,"We had a great four days at the Ekta. From the most friendliest reception to the eclectic decor, this is a great place to base yourself for a few days in Paris. A stone's throw from the Champs Elysee and Arc de Triomphe, and a few train stops. Nice area to walk around. The breakfast is plentiful and just perfect to start the day, well worth it. The beds are comfortable, and the bathrooms modern. Its a great place to come home to, especially if you are out most of the day. I can't say enough about how helpful the staff was. Has elevator access, and coffee and tea in the room, and a minibar that is reasonably priced. There is a cool grocery store and pharmacy right around the corner. No hesitation in coming back!"
1743,"The pick up and drop off service is quite expensive. Please be aware that the 35 euros solo pick up/drop off (70 euros in total) is a shared service (not shared with the guests in the same hotel but shared with other guests even in other towns). When we arrived in Santorini, the driver told us the time to the hotel from the port to the hotel is about 25-30 minutes but in reality we took 1 hour to the hotel because we had to wait the arrival of other guests and the driver should drop off them first. For the drop off to the airport, the hotel told us to meet their representative who would bring out luggage and driver at 14h15 near the post office, but till 14h20 we saw no one and we called the hotel 2 times to ensure that there was no problem. Finally the driver arrived at 14h30.…"
1744,"Breakfast is good, staff are friendly. Though not located at the heart of the city, it is very close to subway station and easy to get around. We stayed at a duplex, good value for money! I would recommend it to friends."
1745,"I have recently stayed at this hotel for a little over two weeks. It's located in a nice area, quite easy to reach shopping malls, restaurants, etc from it. The room is clean and tidy, housekeeping does a good job. However, the window on one side is missing the actual glass, so depending on which side of the hotel your room is, it might get noisy at night.  The breakfast menu is very limited, after 2 weeks one will get sick of eggs, ham and cheese. During breakfast hours the staff often takes long to clean tables after different guests, so you may sit at the table without cutlery for several minutes.  At the front desk English is hardly spoken. Also make sure to check what exactly they are billing you for before paying.  Overall, the experience was not that bad, but certainly…"
1746,"We are here now for the Chicago Marathon weekend. Rather than stay at the host hotel, Hilton, I chose to upgrade to the Fairmont as its  me and my husband alone  I for the weekend (no kids) and he’s running the marathon this am. We love Fairmont Kea Lani and Whistler so I figured we would stay at a nicer luxury level hotel this weekend. Huge mistake. The hotel is super dumpy. I’ve stayed in Holiday Inns that are much nicer for kids tournaments.  The room is basic, yes has a view but the sheets on the bed are scratchy and cheap. Come on! how can you mess that up? The hotel is loud. All the doors SLAM! The toilets are LOUD like in a public park. We slept horribly all weekend.  There are so many great hotels in Chicago I am so disappointed in my choice this weekend.  Location is…"
1747,"We felt the hotel was in an unsafe area with an ""adults only"" cinema round the corner.  The restaurant was a burger bar!  The hotel was clean and the staff very helpful."
1748,Really disappointed in the rooms. It was the room images and views that sold me.   I tried to get a room with a view twice but did not succeed. Over half the rooms are views of a wall just about 10 feet from the window.   This is my first bad review I have written. Very disappointed with the marketing images vs real life.
1749,"My overall comments, This hotel is not a 5*,  The Reids or the Savoy are both 5*. There is a big difference between.  The amenities in the Pestana Casino is not a 5*.  If you are looking and like all the amenities that come with a 5*, Pestana will not be it.  We have stayed in all these hotels and this is what we can say.  However, the prices at Reids and Savoy, are high in priced. (you do pay for what you get at these hotels)  but if you are looking for a nice hotel, clean, great location,  but don't care about the extra amenities then you will be happy with the Pestana Casino.  If you are a regular 5* customer, we will not be happy."
1750,"If you are looking for a good hotel with great service Leonardo Mitte is perfectly located. Close to metro and Friedrichstrasse train station makes it easy to access all parts including airports. Also very close to walk to theaters and museums. Breakfast very good with lots of varieties, you can last for this even over lunch. The hotel is not the cheapest but very good service, friendly reception and great breakfast as well as closely located to interesting restaurants make it a good choice. A when i Berlin don't miss out on the many very good Vietnamese restaurants."
1753,"We really enjoyed our stay here. Positives.  Food, cleanliness, location, staff lovely.  Negatives. A bit disorganised, but the hotel is still very newly opened.  Staff forgot drinks at pool after we ordered on quite a few occasions.  I received some skewer when I sat by the pool. Thinking they were complimentary as is usual in this calibre of hotel. I then realised no one else had them I pointed this out to the staff who snatched them away quickly.  Wrong person whoops!  We visited the spa to book treatments 3 times but no one was at the desk.  There's no where near enough beds on the terrace we had to sit on chairs while others took more than one.  There should be a reservation system or list as when one comes free everyone rushes to get one.  "
1754,"This is a very minimalist appearing hotel. The room is 1 large room with a sink, dressing table and mirror, bed, desk area and 1 or 2 chairs. Most of the decor is white. There's little storage. The shower is behind a 1 way glass door. The lighting is mostly in the sink area. Our room looked out over a lovely garden but it was for viewing only, not sitting in, we were told. There is a room off the lobby where wine is served from 5-7, and coffee and cookies all day. The staff is gracious. The room maintenance is variable."
1756,Me and my friend went In for a drink and appetizer. The bartender asked for my card to hold the tab. After we were done I checked my account and they had authorized my card for $100!! With out even telling me!! I then asked them and Tony the bartender proceeded to tell Me that it will fall off after they post the charge and that every hotel bar does this and argued with me. Which is very untrue!! After they posted the charge it was defiantly not off my account.  I then asked the manager about this and she argued with me as well! Since both of them were no help I went to the mod of the front desk and did nothing as well. He's horrible with people did nothing to fix my problem.  I Work in hospitality and tell all my guests the amount I'm going to authorize their card. I then…
1757,"the hotel looks like a renovation from an aprartment. in each of the floor there is a door outside the elevator and it feels like you're going back to your home. The reception lady  at day time is cool without much smile but very efficient and helpful. The room is very clean and the bathroom is very good equipped with bio products like shampoo, shower gel and soap. The bed is very good and comfortable that I couldn't get out of bed in the morning.There are big windows in my room and it's very bright and sunny at daytime, also there are trees outside so you won't be looked from the streets. The reception lady at night is very helpful and friendly. Overall, I like this hotel a lot.  Unfortunately there is no free wifi in room. it cost about 7 euro for 24 hours. The free wifi is…"
1758,"First time at the W Lakeshore...and absolutely the last. Poor customer service (even as an SPG member), dirty hallways and smelly rooms, terrible restaurant, filthy outdoor areas with dirty dishes and cigarette butts all over the floor, not centrally located.  What more needs to be said for you to avoid this hotel!! There are so many hotel choices in Chicago that will give you a much better experience...so I simply say, DO NOT STAY AT THE W LAKESHORE."
1759,"Recently back from a pleasant four night stay at Hotel 4. The hotel itself is very clean and all staff were friendly, we only used the hotel as a base and was out during the day the hotel was ideal for this as it was only small and does not have much of a recreational area. Breakfast was better than expected and was included in our stay we did expect only continental, however hot cooked breakfast items were available every day and staff were quick to top up any items running low. We did not use the hotel restaurant for any other meals but the restaurant always seemed busy at meal times. My only problem with the hotel was noise from other guests on two nights around 1am I struggled to see how the reception staff could not hear them as lots of doors were being slammed there were…"
1760,"Loved the historic value of this hotel and the free tour on Saturday morning!  Things we didn't love: -luggage stored because our room was not ready had not been delivered 12 hours later (we had to track it down) -We stayed more than one night; our room was not restocked; no new coffee, towels, water etc  -lack of air conditioning (understand that this is an old hotel so maybe not doable) -The façade was covered with scaffolding for almost all of our visit; we were not told about the renovations and no discount was received -front desk did not answer for a long time when we tried to place a wake up call to make our flight; then they failed to make the wake up call"
1761,"Would give 0 stars if possible.  The WORST customer service and management I've ever experienced.  I made a reservation in Jan. 2015 for 4 nights in July 2015.  Called and emailed to cancel TEN WEEKS before the date of my reservation, only to be told that those dates were completely non-refundable.  Thought they'd be reasonable when I explained I hadn't been informed of this or never would have made the reservation in the first place. Who knows what can happen between January and July that might change one's travel plans?  The manager was  inflexible, adversarial and outright rude - the complete opposite of what someone in customer service ought to be.  I tried to get the money back through my payment method. Wheeler Mansion fought this tooth and nail. They thought they should…"
1762,"very poor customer service when looking for 1 additional room, after the hotel JUST told me that they would/could upgrade one of our rooms....which left 1 room available ...but was immediately told that there were no rooms available.  doesn't make any sense.  very disappointing."
1763,"I feel like if you put down $1000 for a 3-night stay you should get service that rivals Motel 6 or Holiday Inn but that has not been my experience in the first night. My email reservation says 12pm check-in, check-in is actually 3pm. They say they will text me when its ready, which is fine. Two hours later I don't get a text so at 4pm I went and went to the desk again. The room was ready, they just forgot to text me. ""Chicago Pizza"" was a 6"" pie made from candle wax with cheese and pepperoni on top of it. My room has no water or coffee, guest services phone just rings with no answer. You have to go downstairs to speak to front desk. Front desk hands me water, but the coffee never arrives. Guest services still doesn't answer. Money aside, not a big deal, just nothing I have…"
1764,"I'm a royal ambassador for Intercontinental hotels, I usually appreciate to stay in this hotel. But from service level I will never stay in this hotel again.  The complain management does not exist respectively is better to not use it, this save you from disappointment."
1765,We booked the Hilton for a bit of luxury considering the vile pollution in this megacity.We needn't have bothered because there was no luxury in this hotel.The room was so outdated with boring old furniture and carpets that I had to go outside and check that we were in the right place.The air con couldn't be lowered to a reasonable temperature so we had to swelter throughout the night making for two grumpy people in the morning.Nothing flash about this place at all and I trust other Hiltons are better than this.Add to this the hotel is stuck in the middle of a concrete jungle with no decent attractions or places to eat within coo-ee.Save your hard earned money and go somewhere else.
1766,"On the edge of central downtown and nearby the main universities a very calm, clean and confortable hotel, with a bar and a restaurant. Very convenient for business or for families. Very gentle service."
1767,"We stayed for 6 nights ending January 9-2015. I will list a few positives before I explain my displeasure. Food was good although expensive, good view from pool on the top floor, clean but small rooms. I liked how they got reserved seats at the beach although the hotel rep expected to be tiped to sit there but was worth the 20 bucks.   It's funny I just read another review about service and that's my first complaint. The front desk staff I won't waste my time as I had limited but terrible dealings with. The part that really bothered me the most is my wife's exchange brother was staying there as well and he is A) Brazilian and B) black and even before he mentioned it there were numerous encounters that I noticed of disrespect, racism and belittlement. The one night for example we…"
1768,"Had a great four night stay at Calma. The continental breakfast is awesome😊😎 Very quiet during night hours too. Close to U, S and Tram bahns. The close vicinity to several good dinner places is an additional plus. Shopping locations are reached with a nice stroll through the cozy streets of Linienstrasse and Auguststrasse."
1769,"Exceptionally pleased with our 3-night stay at this hotel, which is ideally located in the centre of Cannes, close to the station, La Croisette and the main restaurant areas. The staff were all very welcoming and friendly throughout our stay. On arrival we were checked-in, and even shown to our room by Emilie - a rare service these days I would say. We also enjoyed the breakfast in very pleasant surroundings, which set us up well each day, for the day ahead.  We have already booked a return trip to Cannes and stay at this hotel next May 2019."
1772,"A sad surprise!  I arranged for my family and others family friend’s, in a total of 12 people to spend the New Year's Eve 2018-2019 at the Fountainebleau Hotel Family Experience party in Miami. It was a sad experience to start the year. By the name and tradition of the hotel we expected a good organization and a satisfactory level of service. But once you got into the party space, it was a horror, bouncers, and rude clerks and bad-tempered, crappy service, and a buffet of sausages, hamburger looking like rubber meat, salad and a horrible chicken with very few drinks offered at an expensive price of $ 300 per head. The tables should be numbered, I witnessed several discussions of people for tables and chairs, it was depressing. To make matters worse, at the end when you try to…"
1773,"Filthy room, broken lock, crappy bed, shoddy bathroom with poor lighting. Sadly, it's the typical low-rent San Francisco dive that people aren't aware of until they visit this city, looking for affordable lodging. There are few alternatives in the whole city if you don't have $300 plus per night to spend. But one alternative is La Luna Inn, down the street- but a 'world' apart from this dive. Lombard Street is close to much, and also sketchy in some parts. If you stay here, you won't believe that you are in one of the most magnificent cities in the world- you might believe you landed in east L.A. or El Paso, or even worse. And the prices for this place make me sick- again, they get away with it because of the serious lodging and housing shortage in S.F. Greedy, filthy place,…"
1774,"Location of hotel is great. Rooms (studio) was smaller than expected but we'll designed and clean. Good bathroom. The toilet switch broke down and when you are with your wife in an hotel you want it to be repaired quickly. The repair guy was not able to fix it, left without saying anything and the next morning we still couldn't use the toilet. I had to ask for a discount. First only apologies were offered. This is probably the worst thing to break down. WiFi is also unstable. The elevator situation is also strange: to get from your room to the street you have to take two elevators on different places. Breakfast is good. "
1776,"Pro's-  -The staff responded perfectly to my email requesting 4 dinner reservations at specific times and places. -If you want to get away from the the noise and traffic of the Croisette but still be walking distance, this is the place.  -Unbelievably, there was plenty of free public parking on the street fronting the hotel. -The pool area was quiet and charming.  There were two pleasant areas to have food or beverages in the front & back of the hotel.  Cons -The view of the Bay of Cannes is just a peek through some buildings and the view to the garden is limited to a just a few rooms on the garden level.  You should not expect the same kind of views that you get in the high rise hotels in the heart of the Croissette."
1777,"We just got back from two weeks in this hotel and I am not sure to give it 3 or 4 stars. These stars dont stand in relation with the grading of the the hotel since it is without doubt a 4 star hotel. I will try to give an objective review of my experiences.  + Swimming pools  Friendliness staff regardless of the restaurant, reception or cleaning lady  Clean rooms  Great indoor playing room for kids aged 1 to 4 (there is also a room for older kids which we didnt use) View on the ocean Location: a walk into the city is maneagable but there are free busses from the hotel going to Funchal   - Food: in the beginning we found it good but after a week we were bored by the breakfast which is always very similar and aimed at their english guests. Dinner also repeats itself in a weekly…"
1778,"Beautiful stair case, friendly and helpful staff, the room I got had three beds with very comfortable linens. Only the essentials were available. Wifi was free and kind of strong. Parking is €16 per day but if you park on the street it's free. The metro and subway are about 10 minutes walking and can get you anywhere in Berlin. I would definitely stay here again but will not park in the garage."
1779,"I was a week in Berlin with some friends and we were all really satisfies by Axel Hotel. It is not located in the city center but you can reach it within 10 mins with public transport. Instead it is in a elegant neighbourhood surrounded by shopping malls, supermarkets and bars so everything you could need was within walking distance. The hotel is fancy and modern, rooms are not very big but classy and clean and with a nice view. The staff was very professional and helpful. We will certainly repeat or our next trip to Berlin."
1780,"Avoid this hotel - not worth the price: rooms are old (not terrible but not worth 1400rmb per night); service is not 5 year - from the doorman, front desk, to bar staff all act like they don't want to be there (checking in took 10 minutes).   You can go a bit further down the road and get better at St. Regis or Ritz."
1781,"I felt that this Ascott property fell short of the typical standard of Ascott Apartments.    The location was very good for shopping and night life, since it is just a mere 5 min. walk away from Xintiandi, but I had trouble finding decent Chinese style breakfast place every morning around the vicinity.  So, I ended up eating at Ascott itself (which was not very good at all), instant noodle (cooked it at my apartment) or at Coffee Bean at Xintiandi (a boring choice).    The front desk was usually understaffed and some of them don't speak good English. My husband asked them if ""there is any airport tax imposed by Pudong Airport?"" and the reply he received was ""Yes, you can take a taxi to the airport, and it costs..."".  I would have expected a lot more from Ascott, never mind that…"
1782,"This was the absolute worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The room was extremely tiny with low ceilings the best way to describe how miserable this room was is to imagine being cooped up in a telephone booth or small submarine for a whole weekend.  The room was very dingy and dirty feeling.  The air conditioner was so loud and outdated it was hard to relax or sleep.   Then the front desk valet brought me the wrong car on our second day, then couldn't find my car the day we were checking out!! I had to walk up to the valet parking lot to help search for my car after waiting over an hour for valet to retrieve my car!  I would not recommend anyone to stay here!!!!  "
1783,I had scheduled a 6am wake up for a sporting event to find out that cable and wifi was not working. I walked to the lobby and employees were not apologetic nor offer anything to accommodate. I ended up checking out hours later and still no help from staff. 
1784,"My friends and I traveled with group of eight persons, so we booked the 8 bed room for us. The biggest challenge for us was to carry our big luggages (we spent one week before in other cities) to the 4th floor without lift. Room is okay and big enough to us and it is pretty comfy. The view from our room is very nice. Bathrooms only on the 2nd and 3rd floor, and it is clean, I don't see any problem with that. Breakfast is nice as well. The staff are all helpful and always ready to answer any inquiry. However, I guess the wall is not thick enough and does not have noise-reduction. We caught up by the staff when we made noise inside our room."
1785,"En route to Shimla I stayed in this hotel for one night. Standard, corporate hotel with comfortable bedroom and large clean bathroom.  Wanting to get in touch with my kids I asked for WiFi only to discover that the hotel charged for the service. I was amazed. WiFi is a service offered free in small cafes and bars so why a large successful hotel feels the need to charge is astounding.  On leaving the hotel the following morning I completed an evaluation which the reception manager posted in the box.  I was quite clear in outlining my disappointment in the service.  Have I heard from the management? Of course not.  We were offered a packed breakfast as we were leaving at 6.00am.  This proved to be extremely disappointing...when was the last time you had dry bread filled with Heinz…"
1786,"This is our second stay here in a few years. Feels like home. I love being so close to the Sorbonne and the Pantheon. There are so many cute book stores in the area. It is only a five minute walk to Notre Dame and the Seine. Very nice restaurants in the area as well. The concierge is always very helpful. The artwork on the walls, moldings and tall ceilings are all lovely. Just stayed in room 9- the bathroom was huge. It was nice to have free wifi and AC as well."
1787,"I stayed 4 nights in The Ritz-Carlton Shanghai Pudong, the hotel is amazing and good view  but I was not able use my laptop it was very slow or internet was not working contacted the receptionist in the club level  , most of them  are intern and very new the only thing they learn to say is I AM SORRY, also other guests they were smoking their room and I was not able to sleep because of the smell of the smoking was coming to   my room  plus paid RMB  200.00 to get a Sim card to hotel employee  and never got back my change back , I had a massage which was the worst I ever had"
1789,"Why can't ""luxury"" hotels have a decent softer bed?  Paid over $300 per night to sleep on a ""plywood"" mattress. HARD AS A ROCK. The hotel is in s great location.  Room is clean.  Hotel is very quiet at night. The bed is super disappointing.  And the app wants more info before this bad review can be submitted.  How much worse do they expect??!!Sucks!"
1790,"I stayed 4 nights in this hotel on the club floor  28 and any pluses from that are totally ruined by the noise level,coming from the top floor bar.  It is a constant 5 hours of boom boom boom boom boom reverberated and reverberated and reverberated  noise noise noise noise noise.   Sleep is Impossible  Danang is a great city, and I would return in a minute.....but never to this hotel in a million years. Hotels,are for sleep, not the disco experience.  without the noise the hotel would be quite ok. "
1791,"Customer service is a lost art at the Sheraton Grand in Chicago. Upon checking out we questioned a parking charge and were trying to get an explanation. A manager came to talk to us and was probably the rudest person I have encountered at a hotel.   We misunderstood the valet charge and explained that on our last trip we were only charged for one day (on a five night stay). He told us ""you should just chalk that up to your lucky day"" and that ""we aren't making that mistake today"". I asked for a printed receipt and told him I wanted to make sure it was clear on everything they were charging me for. He pretty much refused until I pushed it and he finally gave in. We explained that we were not happy, he pushed our receipt at us and pointed to the door.  I didn't expect to get…"
1792,"I was thrilled to find this funky cool hotel and very much enjoyed my stay. The staff spoke great English, very polite and friendly, the lobby is great for drinks and nibbles, the room was a good size, comfortable bed with a pillow menu, good Molton Brown products, great shower and free minibar that was stocked every day with sodas, water and juice. And great chocolate bites, again, always re stocked. My one complaint was the noise from the street. There seem to be two hospitals close by and all night long we had ambulance sirens going. The hotel gave me earplugs but they did not help much. But even with the restless sleep we got, I would still go back."
1793,We spent an hour and a half trying to get to the hotel on a road that had been closed down for a bike race - our frustration could have been eased had the hotel staff informed us beforehand. The nearby restuarants were crowed and touristy.
1794,"Our family stayed there for 4 nights and we found it to be very comfortable.  Loved the 2 bedrooms, large fridge and washer and dryer.  The staff was extremely helpful and provided a small fan for our room since the AC wasn’t quite powerful enough for us.  Nice property and very conveniently located"
1795,"Hotel needs a re-design in the restaurant layout, variety of good and healthier options menu’s. Entertainment needs an overhaul along with Poolside food and music!  The location of The hotel and the lack of local supermarkets, bars and music the hotel could fill this gap with a better evening entertainment programme which would suit all ages. The hotel seems to be geared up for the older clientelle with the assumption that by 8.30pm everyone wants to go to bed. Bored need more appropriate entertainment as couples and singles alike just didn’t communicate together so going to their room to watch tv even though the beautiful garden and evening warmth didn’t keep people out as there was limited entertainment."
1796,"The bed was hard and not enough pillows.  There were bugs in the kitchen drawers, and bathroom.  The kitchen had few things we needed to cook.  The TV remote did not work.  There was no room change and we were not told this ahead of time.  We would have called to get things fixed but there was no number to call.  Terrible time there loud neighbors in the halls."
1797,We stayed there for 3 nights found room and facilities of a  high standard.We had breakfast on 1 occasion which was of good quality but have to question cost of 25 Euros. Staff were friendly and helpful would recommend for a visit 
1798,You can't get much closer than across the street from the train station so that was very convenient.  This hotel is fine for one night but depending upon the time of traveler you are I would rather walk a bit further and be off the main drag in a bit nicer hotel.  It was clean and had good service but too noisy for my liking and you could hear everyone walking down the hallway and entering the stairwell and doors closing all night long.  Breakfast was ok but the room was small and cramped with many people elbowing their way to the food so we skipped that on the second morning and paid for our own offsite.
1799,"Hotel was nice, room was cozy. Had a good stay.  Just got an email from a company asking me to leave a review on TripAdvisor, ReviewExpress; I never gave permission to share my email address or other personal information with anyone else. "
1800,"Terrible place. Smells Like a nursing home. Looks like one. Staff act like they work in one.   Room was decent size. Dated but functional. Bed was awful...mattress was on its last legs and we were unable to sleep. The room door didn't close fully unless you jammed it hard.  Shower decent but shower curtain didn't fit so water goes all over the floor.   Staff... Well, I asked how long it would take to walk to pier 39. 40 min he told me. Then said he wasn't sure. Ten said he wasn't really from here / or new? When asked a question he gave a lethargic stare and mumbled some half baked answer. Left him alone after that and we navigated our way around SF without motels assistance. Car parking is very tight!   Wireless works well.   Breakfast...few cakes/ pasties and coffee and juice.…"
1801,Worst hostel I've even stayed in. What kind of youth hostel doesn't allow you to bring a girl home when you've been out in San Francisco?!? No spirits served at the bar downstairs and the hostel is located in a highly unsafe location.
1802,"I had to stay there for 10 nights (work). The check in was very nice and they gave me an upgrade to a suite (not a real suite - just a bit bigger room with a little kitchenette). The view from the window is sad. The room is also sad. There is not much love in the decoration. Easy to replace stuff. TV on the wall - with a strange selection of channels. The doors are very noisy - when one of your neighbors returns, you will know. The bed is hard - very hard. The average guest here is 23 years old. I´m a bit older (46). The lobby is a place to party. There is a restaurant. Menu is ok - bit expensive (a simple ice cream 5,5 Euro). But don't expect to talk in the restaurant. Feels like a disco. The waiter is also a bit slow. It is very close to the Metro and the Tram. Would I stay…"
1803,"This is my second time at this Hotel. Very near at Dysseny Hub, the Designe museum of Barcelona. Very cozy and comfortable stay, well renovated. Very helpfull and willing receptionists! It will be my choice next year too!"
1804,"The hotel is never a 5 star in appearance, rooms, lounges and food.  The lounges are a bar and lounge off the entrance and is very ordinary.  The rooms are plain and colourless.  The buffet food is the worst ever.  Little choice and the hot is never hot."
1805,"I spent four days in august with my wife at the Marriott in Obidos.  Beware of one thing, the web site of the hotel should wear a big sign ""coldest place in Europe..."". When everywhere else in August is very hot, Obidos has a micro climate that keeps it cool all year long.  Swimming in the sea is out of the question and even walking is problematic.  Perfect weather for golf though, which is what we ended up doing every day.  As for the hotel, nice rooms, good service, mediocre restaurants."
1806,"I only stayed in this hotel one night having been delayed for 24 hours due to high winds at the airport. We were allocated this hotel for the night. On arrival the lady in reception was lovely. Very friendly and helpful. The decor was very pleasant. The bedroom was beautiful, very well made up, with a lovely large bathroom. The restaurant was very pleasantly decorated, and staff were helpful. The buffet evening meal was nice, but very little choice to choose from. The bar was very pleasant as were the bar staff, and drinks were branded spirits. Quite a pleasant evening, however on return to the bedroom I noticed quite a few ants on the furniture and in the bathroom. This was off putting for the night. I don’t think I would holiday at this hotel."
1807,"While the rooms and hotel were clean and the hotel was conveniently located, the poor hospitality by the front desk attendants spoiled the experience. The attendants were rude, confrontational and public when there was an issue with charges at checkout. The issue was very minor and easily rectified by another attendant. This experience alone would keep me from returning as a customer or recommending this hotel to anyone. I expect a hotel in this class to take hospitality more seriously."
1809,"Stayed here 4 nights first week October, room was dirty, no air con, no room safe, shower was poor, yes it is on the doorstep of Fishermens wharf but, we didn't get more then a couple of hours uninterrupted sleep on any night, people shouting outside the window all night, shop across the street open 24 hours, and taking in truck deliveries all night long, big bus tourist buses park outside all day with engines running, whatever time of day or night this is really noisy location, and many unfortunate homeless sleep out side on the sidewalk, which adds the noise particularly at night, OK location but overpriced for the quality offered."
1810,"We booked five nights here at the last minute due to issues with the hotel we had previously booked. Everything happens for a reason and I'm glad we stayed here instead. It is very pricey but as a one off, it was worth it! Had a balcony on the 6th floor overlooking Passeig De Gracia which was amazing. Loved sitting out at night with a glass of wine, watching the rooftop exhibition at La Pedrera/Casa Mila, it was quite spectacular!  Also pet friendly, and very accommodating of our two small dogs, although we were charged a nightly rate for them on top of the room rate which is a bit annoying. We had a nice suite with a well equipped, modern kitchen (even though I didn't use it, seriously, it was so modern I couldn't even switch on the grill!!!).  All in all, a lovely place to…"
1811,"Convenient location, and good breakfast. However, the room is super tiny and pity. The check-in process took 30mins due to unable retrieve from the system. The same problem for the guests in front of me too."
1812,"Booked a city break and excellent price for 4 nights midweek Location ok, little away from the sights, but within walking distance Rooms large and clean Food at breakfast and the one meal we had excellent and not too expensive Shame the pool was closed Staff friendly and helpful"
1813,"I was fooled by the price although it wasn't low . The room is very very very narrow that you one person can't even move , how about two ?!! The hotel is getting renovated and changing into another chain hotel.  The housekeepers are very rude , they kept slamming the doors of the rooms they were cleaning and considering the sleeping neighbors. The neighborhood is fine , almost every thing you need is available around."
1814,A fabulous show such energy and polish and I highly recommend it  Not however so much the Carlton  management for allowing a person in shorts with two toddlers into the  ballroom having sent an email encouraging glam clothing and definitely no shorts  What a pity to spoil the ambience for those around them ( fortunately not us ) The stars of the show were so friendly encouraging photographs with them making for such a memorable night 
1816,"This hotel is in the middle of the Latin Quarter near the University.  The staff is friendly and the hotel is extremely convenient to the RER and the Metro and nearby sites on Ile de la Cite.  The room is a little small, but that's to be expected for European hotels.  Good stay.  Will stay again when in Paris."
1817,"Lobby and bar area were nice but the hotel rooms are downright nasty -- dirty, old bathrooms desperately in need of upgrades; outdated furniture that's super uncomfortable; dirty carpet; old mattress....just a bad scene all the way around."
1818,"Already visited this hotel 5 times, with a reason ! Very friendly staff throughout the whole hotel -Checking  in is fast and easy, and cold drinks and sweats at the welcome desk is a well appriciated gesture. Even changing the roomtype was no problem, and done with a smile ! - All rooms are modern and very clean, and all normal things are there ( free welcome bottle of water, safe, individual AC, refrigerator with pay drinks, extra cusions, toiletteries,...) - prefer a room not opposite of the elevators. - inside, the rooms are very silent. - inside the room free wifi, and 4 out of 5 times it was very fast, last visit not so in my room (213) Hope this will be upgraded soon. - breakfast was every time superb, and with every visit even expanded in choise. Important to know that…"
1820,"Four adults sharing a 2-bedroom apartment with AinB rentals was a great decision. When we arrived at the airport, we telephoned the contact person at the number provided after booking. He was there to greet us when we arrived at the location of the apartment. Showed us two suites, we picked one on a lower floor as there was no elevator (yet). It was exactly as pictured on the website, which was a relief. Location was wonderful, suite was excellent, and price was good."
1821,"Gorgeous hotel with excellent amenities. The gym is well equipped and also provides facilities for showering after a work out.  The spa had a good steam room and dry sauna with an experience shower. This is free for guests to use but booking essential as you will have sole use of that area once in there. They provide towels,robes,slippers and toiletries plus a lovely jug of much needed iced water! A great experience. The breakfast buffet is outstanding and the range of foods plus beautiful presentation is truly enjoyable, accommodating all tastes.  We just couldn’t do it all justice!! My only negative is unfortunately the beds. The mattress was quite uncomfortable and dipped in the middle even though it had a mattress topper on it. I am used to extremely comfortable hotel beds…"
1822,"Everything. From the warm welcome to our beautiful room with our own large private patio, comfortable bed, delicious breakfast and very friendly and helpful staff. The welcome bubbly was the cherry on top! Thoroughly  enjoyed our stay."
1824,"I had a great time staying at Axel hotel. The front office staff was super friendly and helpful, they gave me a lot of tips and took their time to make my stay great. The rooms were nice and the area is very central. The spa area is excellent. Will definitely stay here again next time."
1825,"Having booked 2 rooms for an unexpected week of business in SF, I mistakenly booked check-in one day earlier than needed. I'm a small business owner and wear a lot of hats. Within 1 minute I realized my mistake and called Expedia - who told me to call the hotel.   After first connecting to the hotel's offshore reservations, I was finally given a direct number to the hotel. I am now approximately 15 minutes since booking online and being connected to ""in-house reservations.""  To say in-house reservations were actively unhelpful would be an understatement.   After speaking with them and then Expedia across 4 more calls (and nearly 2 hours of my day), the result is that I still have to pay for the full booking including two rooms that will now sit empty for a night - an extra $900+…"
1826,"We stayed here for a weekend and really enjoyed it. The location adjacent to the u-bahn station makes getting there really easy, and the hotel is within easy walking distance of the sites on Museum Island, Unter den Linden and Alexanderplatz. Our room was on the garden side and there was, litterally, no noise at all; we could have been in the middle of the countryside. The room was very comfortable, with air conditioning, and had enough plug sockets in sensible locations. We also loved the overall air of design about the place, somebody had really thought about how everything looked and there was intereting art on all the walls. A minor point...but the use of the floor socket uplighters to illuminate the corridors was lovely!"
1827,My 16 year old daughter and I were lucky enough to spend 5 nights at Hotel Esprit Saint Germain. The staff were always helpful and attended to our every need. We stayed in the Prestige Terrace room and it was exactly as the website described. It was our first time to Paris and our French was not as good as I had hoped and we never had any issues with communication. Everyone was always friendly. The experience was exactly as described. I would highly recommend this hotel and if I return to Paris I would look no further than the Hotel Esprit Saint Germain.
1828,"I was extremely disappointed in my recent stay at the Wit. Great location. Great room. Terrible follow-up.  My shower had a broken razor sharp drain and (see photo) After slicing my toe open (see photo) and while still bleeding I reported it to the front desk. Because I was leaving the hotel I requested they send me an email when it was fixed because I didn't want anyone else to get injured.  I was promised by the Front Desk Supervisor that it would be fixed and I would be notified. Well, that never happened.  As a Hilton Honors Gold member with 125 nights of travel a year,  safety is important to me.  I would not stay in suite 2605 without checking the shower first if I were you."
1830,"Stayed for one night. Location was great, 1 minute walk to subway & trams. Very easy to get tram to main bus station. Lots of bars and restaurants in area. Staff were friendly & helpful. Rooms were small but did the job. Air com worked & free wifi. Not many sockets t charge your phone etc and when found some the plug kept falling out, hence unable to charge phone overnight. Had the same problem in the bar area, we tried a few different plugs and same problem. Loved the funky carpet (with footprints) in the hall "
1831,"Le Grand Hotel is in the perfect location in Cannes. It is right on Boulevard de la Croisette, meaning it is on the beach and in the heart of Cannes. The best amenity of the hotel is La Plage 45, which is the beach club at the hotel. The staff at the beach club is absolutely wonderful. They cater to your every need, and they ensure your comfort throughout the day. The beach club is one of the finest in Cannes, with great music, food, drinks, and service.  La Plage 45 made my trip to Cannes an unforgettable experience.   The hotel is very close to luxury shopping and excellent dining options. There is no need to have a car or even to take a cab while staying at Le Grand Hotel, as everything you would like to visit is within walking distance. Many of the city's finest restaurants…"
1832,"If you find the place near by the station, it’s your choice. Easy to go everywhere you need e.g. way to Berlin Wall, Brandenburg gate. And easy walk to Deutsches Historisches Museum , Lustgarten and nearby.👏 "
1833,"This is a modern hotel in the more ""business"" district of Barcelona, near the Glòries shopping centre. As such it is a reasonable walk to get to the more touristy areas such as  the Sagrada Familia or the beach and harbour. There is a metro stop nearby or the hop on tourist buses are available.  The food in the restaurant is good value and very nice. The breakfast offers a wide variety of cooked food, cereals, breads and pastries, and many other continental style offerings. The views from the pool area at the top of the hotel are fabulous as it is one of the taller buildings in the city. The pool is unheated so can be very cold in winter. During our October stay the bar in the hotel was shut, so you had to use the rooftop bar which can be chilly. The staff were all very pleasant…"
1834,I keep coming back to this hotel over and over and get the same receptionist  Very good service.   Worth the cash that you spend aswell. If only there were offers for frequent clients  Haha :) :P   You won’t regret.  
1835,"I stayed in Kastanienhof hotel for 3 night, in january 2015.  We had to cancel our first booking due to a mistake and re-do a second booking, the staff was really nice and polite. Even when we arrived, they tried to help us with everything we needed.  We booked the triple room... it was very spacious (and clean). It was a double room, with a connecting single (small) room (perfect for families).  Even the location is very good, about 6 minutes walking from 2 metro's stops.  I can't complain about anything..it defiantly worths its price!  The only  ""lack"" was the choice of the furnitures... too much classic/old. When I first saw the pictures on the internet i didn't expect to like that hotel... But the cleanliness of the room make me forget about the questionable style."
1836,"Let's start with the positives. The Epic Sana Lisboa is situated in a safe, central location of Lisboa. Visually stunning inside and out. The lobby, restaurant, & pool area are impeccable as are the rooms and amenities. The food was delicious.  The negatives include the cold, impersonal service at the front desk. The cocktail servers in the bar area were far from experienced to the point that one did not even know what vodka was.  We never felt welcomed at any point of our visit. We will not recommend nor stay here again. "
1837,"Not a bad hotel, getting a little old and could do with a renovation! Bed needs replacing. Not up to standard I would expect from a Mercure.   I paid extra for a privilege room, came with coffee machine better toiletries, water bottle etc. But these items were only provided on day one not replaced (except newspaper which was provided each day) wasn’t worth the extra dollars!  Breakfast basic with minimal food. Wouldn’t pay the $18 if it wasn’t included in my room rate. Spend the money at a local cafe and get a much better meal!  Could find better in Melbourne for similar pricing."
1838,"The hotel is quite modern and relatively convenient to various area of Lisbon and the airport with close Metro connections.  The room, on arrival, was lovely.  But over the following 4 days used items (soap, shampoo, tea) were not replenished.  The front office staff were apparently unable to provide the missing items."
1839,"I stayed here for two nights with my fiancé on our break to Berlin. On arrival to the hotel, we were welcomed by the hotel staff who were very friendly to us and checked us in to our room. We were informed there was a restaurant and a bar that we could attend if we wanted to.  Our hotel room was very nice, clean and modern. Our room had clean towels available. A glass bottle of water and two glasses were there in our room as a welcome treat from the hotel. We also had a safe available to use for free. There was a TV on the wall. There was a booklet in the room giving you tons of information and services at the hotel, they also had a free pillow service to suit your style of pillow to support you through the night which I thought was a very special touch. Couldn't be happier with…"
1840,"When you enter the hotel lobby is pretty impressive with its modern furniture and bar. However it is less impressive in the morning when  the same lobby is jammed with people all trying to have breakfast. The isle with the food is rather narrow and way too small to accommodate the morning rush. Breakfast is €11 and generally okay. Rooms are very clean and some have nice city views. However they are very small und furnished rather spartanly. There is only one night-table so you personal items have to be placed on the floor if you want them nearby and you end up on the empty side of bed. There are no glasses just two paper cups. No blow dryer either. The bed was comfortable though. So, the hotel is only okay for short stays. Staff is friendly and helpful. Tram Nr. 4 is only a few…"
1841,"We had room for 6 people...it was surprisingly well arranged so we did not feel too crowded. Separate bathroom and toilet in the room was a plus! And the breakfast is value for money - 7,50euro is very good price for such various and quality breakfast! I loved herbal teas, fresh vegatables, nice choice of bread, cheese, eggs...and something sweet with coffee! Also location just next to the U & S bahn station Zoologishe Garden is very comfortable. There's also a parking for hotel guests, if you come with a car."
1842,"we stayed here through one of those discount hotel websites's express deals. Still managed to get a great room, since sometimes when you go through a discount site a hotel has different levels of rooms for that. It seemed we got a standard room which was very modern and well decorated. Tight compared to American standards although completely normal by Parisian hotel standards. The front desk was very helpful with directions and getting us a bucket of ice for no charge. It was nice, and we really liked it. Also it's close to the Opera so easy to get to the airport shuttle, and close to Gallerie Lafayette if you like shopping and food."
1843,"Ok it's not 5 star. It's 3. Rooms are nice, good bathroom and cleaned daily. I read reviews before arrived and the restaurant in particular got a slateing. Well, continental breakfast is what it is. Toast, rolls, cheese, salami and European quality ham. Ok coffee is typical machine coffee. This hotel is good enough. Positioned on north east corner of city. Once your used to the map and little roads your 5 mins walk from the extra amazing cafè culture this city has. Consider the room rates for all the other hotels and honestly tell me this isn't a good deal."
1844,"Me and my fiancee stayed here for 4 nights and we are very pleased with our stay. The room is clean and comfy and has everything you need, modern. The staff are very nice and accomodating. Very good location, lots of places to eat and a groccery store across the street.   Location is perfect, nearby a metro, youre living central and this arrondisement number 9 is a very nice place to be. "
1846,"One of these rare places that look exactly like the pictures on the website. Beautiful room, great breakfast and wonderful service. And a good spot to start exploring the city!  You also have some great restaurants and bakeries in the neighbourhood. You'll want for nothing :-)"
1847,"I stayed about a week there for business. My first impression when I crossed the door of the room was “this smells awful”. All inside was old and let’s be honest... outdated. One night I arrived late, the restaurant was closed, so they told me to get room service. From my room I called room services and ordered a Burger, fries and a Diet Coke. After 45 minutes I call back and the literally say “ I don’t speak English”... and cut the conversation. Then I called back again and didn’t have a response. When it was 1 hour after the first call, I was able to get someone who answered and speaks English... answer :” we don’t have a register of what you ordered. So we haven’t prepared anything and now the kitchen is closed” Then, every night we had construction noise... bottom line, never again. …"
1848,For $120 US a night this is a joke! Asked for a non smoking room. Smoke was coming through from the next room. Cold showers! Stayed in the superior room & you can hear all the other guests opening & closing doors so its hard to sleep. Takes 10mins taxi ride into town. Would not recommend!
1849,"Soulless common areas, cockroaches in the room, and the hotel was on the edge of one of the most dangerous areas in San Francisco. Without any warning from the hotel staff, we ended up walking past outlines of dead bodies and people injecting heroin into their arms just 100m away from the hotel entrance on the way to market street. "
1850,"We arrived on Wednesday the 20th and was booked in for 3 nights. We arrived a couple of hours earlier and was checked in. The staff were friendly and first impressions were good of the hotel. We were in room 511. A large room with and kingsize bed and had lots of things on offer. Tassimo, fridge etc. The things in the fridge you had to pay for. Ive never had to pay for things in a hotel indigo and always have had a complementary drink/drinks which includes bottled water. So I was shocked this is not the case here.  I asked for additional bedding and a kettle and both were supplied. The only issue regarding the room was the noise from outside. It is double glazed but every 10 minutes a siren was going off from police cars, ambulances etc. This woke me up a couple to times. I did…"
1851,"Our second stay with Sabine was as fabulous as the first! If you’re planning a visit to Berlin this is the only place to stay!   Great location, spotlessly clean, very comfortable beds, delicious and plentiful breakfasts and a wonderful hostess....what more could you ask for! "
1852,"The location and view and facilities were wonderful. But the a staff wasn’t friendly and helpful.  I booked a Executive River Room(directly) with free upgrade package to Executive corner room. When I was checking in, the receptionist, Utsay told me my room was upgraded to a Executive River room from a Executive room. I said I directly booked the river room so there was no upgrade but he insisted I booked a Executive room and I’ve already been upgraded. Then I used my very expensive oversea roaming internet to open my email and showed him that’s I directly booked a river room. Now he said ok but there is no corner room available. I don’t know there was a mistake in your system or Utsay deliberately lied to me.  Then I asked if the tarrece room was available can I get upgrad to…"
1853,"Everything was ordinary.  They had not room service. I have seen many hotels with much better service and room design. Bathroom Soup and shampoo and other Things were not packed in luxury packages. They were in liquid shape in  soap dispenser hanged to the wall. therefore, I was not able to know the brand and the quality. The receiption told the checkout time is 2 PM but at 12:30 the room was locked and I had to go to the receiption when I was extremely in a hurry."
1855,"We enjoyed our four nights in Hotel Vic Eiffel. The staff were all friendly and helpful. The room was fresh and bright, the bed very comfortable and the towels lush. Breakfast was delicious, a good selection on offer. "
1856,"We stayed at this hotel for 1 night and saw rooms 002 and 213. We changed from 002 because it was just too dark, the room 213 was a bit brighter, but the windows are small. The room was clean and the bed was resonably comfortable. The Flat Screen TV in the room is really really small, but the selection of programs is good for Portuguese hotels. The hotel has private parking for a reasonable 8.00 EUR per night. The location is very good, but the building next to the hotel is abandoned and tagged and looks horrible.   Overall I would say that the EUR 82.00 with parking but without breakfast is acceptable, but not such a great value for money."
1857,"This was a pretty good hostel, it was clean and the facilities were good. Its what you need but nothing extra. I didnt like that I had to make my own bed but whatever. Also the pub crawl was just decent. Theres a bar there so thats cool, and I liked the staff"
1858,"The property has a long history. VIP Hotel in Berlin's haydays, Timmy, the painter, in the Lobby. Booking it today is a madhouse affair, direct Bristol rates are steeper than ""booking"" (.com) engines, GHA Discovery price for ""Insiders"" still higher, and ""Breakfast Buffet"" is a scam. €25 for Hotel guests, €19 if booked with the room, but the DISREPUTATIONAL reality is that third-party provider ""REINHARD'S AM KUDAMM"" (who actually offers the Buffet) allows Bristol to mark it up for his inhouse Hotel clients by up to €13 extra. It is the ""outsourcing surcharge"". That is not honest policy, especially when some breakfasters uncover it. Also, nice white table cloth was removed a while ago for cheapness and not for ""more rustic looks"". Highspeed Internet seems to be another…"
1859,"Restaurant very good to excellent, could eat early dinner which was decided plus as a tourist and quality very good to excellent.  Very good service, table setting etc. restaurnt is in back of hotel as you enter front entrance   first class decor   we ate dinner there but were staying in much samller  hotel Cotton House around the corner."
1860,"We stayed for 4 nights at the hotel. Everything was perfect. Rooms with high design, full equipped. In a perfect area ( near to metro and bus stations, near to SM, near to cafes and restaurants). We really enjoyed our stay at adagio hotel."
1861,"Definitely not a 5 star hotel. Dated & in need of renovation. Noisy air conditioning, which didn’t blow out any cold air. Comfortable & clean. Friendly staff. Would recommend the hotel bar, which has a great selection of Portuguese wines! Be prepared for aircraft noise in the morning & the church bells from 8.30am! "
1862,From check in to check out what an experience.  Before I start let me say we know check in is at 4.  We arrived early due to an early morning flight and upon checking in we were told that we had been upgraded to a suite.  What they did not tell us was that the suites were the last room to be released.  We were told they would call when the room was ready.  After lunch I rechecked and was told 2:30 and she could not promise to call that she might be busy. Checked at 2:30 and was told close to 4:00 and he would call.  At 3:30 got into the long line to check to be told our room would not be ready till close to 5:00.  She also informed me again that check in is at 4:00 it’s 3:45.  Well by now I am aggravated and just want a room.  We had to be at an event at 6.  She said she did not…
1864,"hotel’s location is ok, and thats it.  Staff is very unwelcoming, very confused and extremely rude.  hotel’s lift didnt work. The pool is very dirty and not maintained. For 1 day the pool wasnt active at all since there was gardening all around. At checkout i saw the worst side of this hotel, a disgruntled front desk employee named BB which introduced her self as the manager, which decided that she needs to charge me with all different strange fees, all though these were all paid upfront. Nothing could help explaining this lady that she is wrong. At one point she started talking to herself and acting wierd, and thats when i realized that this hotel is realy a piece of ****.  Luckily the hotel manager, rodney, helped me out - if it wasnt for him, this was a disaster.  STAY AWAY…"
1865,"This hotel is lovely. We stayed in the Jungle Suite for my birthday and the room was amazing. Bigger than we expected, the bed, the shower and the jacuzzi bath were lovely. The bed was so big and so comfy I didn't want to get out of it! The rest of the hotel just as lovely and always spotless. We dealt mainly with Lea on reception, we spoke prior to our arrival via booking.com booking assistant. She was so lovely and so helpful, we were able to check in early too which was great! Not very often I would want to return to a hotel I have already visited, but I definitely would here!!! Highly recommend. We didn't have breakfast as we thought it was slightly too expensive, but the free coffee machine was a nice touch and available 24/7. Location was great - little supermarket shop…"
1866,"After a long working day on a Friday (Sept. 13th, 2019), I flew from Houston to Chicago. Checked into Palmer House Hilton hotel around 10pm. As a courtesy I thought the check-in clerk will give a small drinking water bottle but she did not offer any. I went into the room and tried to connect to wi-fi with the code provided by the check-in clerk. The app did not provide any option to enter the code. I called the front desk, after a good wait some one answered my call and could not help my wi-fi connection issue and advised me to connect with the technical support team. That evening I was totally exhausted and had no energy to deal with the technical support. I told him I was thirsty and he advised me to go to the reception to get some water, I told him I was really tired, then he…"
1867,"As always, excellent service from friendly staff, rooms clean and comfortable with nice little touches. Opposite the Gare du Nord so ideally placed for onward travel either to or from the south. in addition it is an excellent base for visiting Paris itself."
1868,"The rooms were nice and clean and the hotel is centrally located, however the prices inside the hotel are a scam - absolutely exhorbitant for anywhere in the world. I was feeling ill one night and ordered broth with noodles. They brought what tasted like Lipton pre-packaged soup in a small coffee cup and charged me $13 USD for it. A glass (not even a bottle) of sparkling water was $7 USD. There are also no common meeting areas in the hotel where you can meet without having to order something that’s outrageously priced. As a result, every time the group I was with sat down to debrief or have a check in we would end up spending $75 USD just for a couple coffees and waters for 5 people. If you’re just staying, this hotel is fine, but if you need to spend any time at the hotel, I…"
1869,Interesting hotel. Room was funky and modern. Lack of space for your belongings and there’s not a lot of storage space.  Conveniently located though and the staff was helpful. If you are into something different then they may be the hotel for you. Personally I won’t be staying here again. 
1870,"NEVER AGAIN  If you do stay, make sure to get the names of all staff you deal with, because they will tell you things that are not true.  The room and hotel itself are nice, but the staff and customer service is terrible, and the fees they charge you are outrageous.  I am now seeing an additional fee i've been charged after checking out for an additional $200, and am on the phone with Jonathan the desk manager who is offering no help.    I drove up to SF for the weekend from LA, and I chose this hotel specifically because I knew I would arrive before the normal check in time.  I called ahead before booking and was told by the desk agent that I could check in early because the hotel was not at capacity.  I arrived at 1pm, and upon check in, was told "" I don't have anywhere to put…"
1871,"We stayed in this wonderful hotel in February last year and it was absolutely perfect in every way.  The hotel staff were warm, welcoming and could not have been more helpful.  The room was lovely and the breakfast delicious.  This was our first time in Paris and sadly we could only stay a few days.  When we go back we will look forward to staying at Hotel Phileas again."
1872,"Very bad and rubish check in, floors are very noisy at night, alot of party in the rooms, never again!!!! Breakfast is okay but not pleasant. The only good thing - people with a disability work there. "
1873,"Apart from its nice location, we expected the hotel to be more modern. The room was old style requiring improvements. Average breakfast and nice parking place.  Overal good for a short business stay or for enjoying the city, not the hotel."
1874,"On arrival the apartments are very difficult to find - there are no signs to guide you and you have to go up to the 19th floor. Reception is a small desk in the corridor. Don't expect any niceties or extras - they just give you your key and that's it. The apartment itself was very run down and rough around the edges. There were stains on the carpets and walls, the windows were grubby and rotting in the corners, and the bathroom was stained, crumbling and damp, and the shower curtain was mouldy. The air conditioning works fine but is very clunky and turns on and off intermittently with a very loud clunk which will wake you up in the night. The bed sheets are clean, but I found the mattress very uncomfortable and the pillows very thin. The TV did not work, the blinds in the…"
1875,"My friends and I were looking for a decent place to stay on a budget, and our expectations were absolutely exceeded. The location next to a train is ideal, and there is so much to do within walking distance. The friendly hotel staff's recommendations were spot on, from good local schnitzel to chill places to relax, and the touristy accommodations were also refreshing. The towels and bedding were changed every day, and the other guests were respectful. Honestly the nicest hostel I've ever been to."
1876,"PLUS: Very friendly staff, good breakfast (with smoked salmon, which I love), nice decorations, a small walk from the Diagonal avenue and El Corte Inglés  MINUS: The room was a bit dark and my pillows had a lot of dust. The bedside table was covered in dust by morning. It didn't bug me much but it can bother somebody with more cleanliness requirements than I."
1877,"Nice clean and friendly hotel close to a lot of Berlin tourist areas and transportation. Hotel is situated within 5 minute walk to Hackescher Markt station which is 2 stops from Berlin central station - no train change required. A taxi from the airport (TXL) cost us €23. Hackescher Markt has tourist eateries and on Fridays (maybe other days as well) lots of great street vendor foods. Walking distance to Museum Island but a hike to Brandenburg Gate and The Reichstag Building. We had a 1brm apartment which was in top condition with washer/dryer in the bathroom which looked nearly new. Front desk staff were great, very friendly and fixed key swipe problems with a minimum of fuss. The free in room wifi managed about 2Mbps during peak and there was a faster paid option available.…"
1878,"The hotel is very well located on the Kurfuerstendamm street, near several subway and bus stations, with easy access to airport and touristic sites. The room was nice and clean. What i did not like it is that  they only have twin beds in the double rooms. Also, more light in the room would have been appreciated."
1879,"Close to 2 different metro stops, 5 minute walk to Eiffel Tower, rooms typical European, small but clean wifi in the room and worked great. Air conditioning controlled by the front desk but worked great"
1880,"2 minor items (one needed maintenance), notified to the reception at 8.pm were solved when we returned from Dinner at 11.pm. Very good Customer Relation service! Breakfast service improved since October 14 - fast, attentive, friendly. In the ""Superior"" Room almost no storage capacity for your clothes. As a couple you have to live out of your suitcases during your stay. Bathroom floor always wet after use of shower, due to the ""intelligent"" design/construction of the open shower glass walls. Not very pleasant, neither for the guests nor the maids. Reserved amounts of Hotel still blocking credit card days after checkout and proper payment."
1881,"Stayed 3 nights in RamblasApartments and was the perfect homebase to explore Barcelona. Very centrally located to explore Bario Gotico, Raval, and close to las Ramblas and Placa Catalunya. We had a room that overlooked the street and offered great ambience and views. There is a convenience store jsut below where you can grab drinks/food to cook in the kitchen, The room overall is very well situated!"
1882,Staff does not speak English well and want to charge you for checking in early.  Terrible explanations for doing that. People coming and going from front desk and no one to explain what is going on. I won’t stay there again.
1883,"I was not allowed to finish my stay at Found Hostel because of John, one of the managers.  He claimed that there were people smoking marijuana in my room to which he has no evidence; he did not even file a police report.  He obviously has a mental disorder.  Luckily he will be moving back to Arizona soon (so he claims).  There are several construction issues.  The room I stayed in was not ADA compliant.  The shower “off and on” switch is backwards, so “off” is “on”.  The light next to the bed did not reach any available outlets.  The bunk railing is missing two screws, so it rattles.  There is a sharp crack under the toilet paper holder.  John said he would refund the amount for the remainder of the stay, but he never did.  I have contacted my attorney."
1884,"We stay at The Residence many weeks a year. Whilst some aspects remain memorable, others have deteriorated. The senior managers appear to be less visible, appear not to be as concerned as their predecessors, appear to have less interest in the owners and appear to be not as keen on quality issues. The decor in the suites has lost the 'wow factor', the furnishings are looking very tired and the standards overall have lowered in comparison to the new hotels and their sister partner hotels. The gardens remain a real pleasure to visit. The front line staff overall do a good job, trying hard to please. The rules that appeared to be in place previously re the times that children were allowed in some areas of the hotel appears to know be not apparent"
1886,"We were essentially trapped in this hotel on a two week business trip.  We booked / paid in advance and when we tried to change hotels we found that we wouldn't get any of our money back, so we were stuck for an entire 2 weeks in the Savoy.  Where do I start?  Firstly, we arrived at about 8 PM to find out that they weren't ""sure"" if we actually had rooms.  Somehow the issue got resolved and we were each handed our room keys.  I went to my room only to find that other guests were in my room - luckily I could hear them talking from the hallway, so I didn't enter the room.  The guy at reception called the room and had an awkward conversation with the people in the room who clearly were staying in the room, then had me go upstairs with them and talk to them AGAIN before admitting…"
1887,"A 3 star resort with 5 star prices. The location was the one good thing. Very pretty setting. Otherwise, the room was utterly charmless. Could have been any airport hotel in America in terms of the rooms setup, furnishings and fixtures. The food was institutional garbage. Just awful. The pool area is tired and depressing and inadequate to the demand of the number of guests. Everyone was fighting for chairs. Won’t be back. "
1888,"The whole experience with this hotel was amazing, from the fast check-in, to modern and clean rooms with comfortable beds, to “all-day-available” drinks, buffet breakfast, evening wine and snacks (more like a light dinner).  Unbelievable quality and value in the centre of Cannes."
1889,Let me first say that I have been coming here for years and I know a lot of the staff but this trip was a disaster. First off I emailed the front office manger that I was coming. The response time took too long so I booked through Agoda for the fear I wouldn't get a room for the weekend. They finally saw my email and reservation and sent a nice welcome back message. It's all downhill from here. They gave me a room that was at the end of a dark pathway that faced a building. They all said I have VIP status since I come so often. I guess they forget that when they gave me this room. The air conditioner kept shutting off on the 1st night. We called maintenance and they said I had to reset the power every time that happens. Wonderful. The next day we told the front desk what was…
1890,"I was in Paris for a conference. The hotel is very close to the train station, and there are also restaurants nearby and the neighborhood is safe for walking. There is free wifi (you have to get the password from the front desk). The air conditioning is awesome. Although there were only 2 of us, I reserved the 3-person room and it was totally worth it for the extra space. The staff are professional and nice (they helped us figure out the phone and then made that unnecessary by making our dinner reservation for us - thanks!). Tip: there is soap and shampoo in the room, but not conditioner, so bring your own or buy it from the drugstore next door."
1891,"From the lobby, the hotel looks great. But be warned, any booking of a double standard room or less you will be in the basement or the secondary building. We booked a double standard room which was in the secondary building up 2 flights of very VERY narrow stairs. Seriously we struggled just getting our carry on luggage up the stairs for fear of falling down. The room is TINY. Again our carry on luggage barely had room to fit. There was no space to lounge around in the room. The bathroom looked fine until you actually took a shower. The half glass 'door' did nothing to prevent water from flooding the floor.  Every time we showered, our bathroom floor was completely flooded. Not fun.  The room itself was clean and the bed was comfortable. The location was great too because the…"
1892,"We stayed at four small hotels in Palermo (Duque, Magnolia, Mine, Vitrum) and all had helpful, friendly, well-trained staffs EXCEPT for the Vitrum.  At check-out we witnessed the manager in a confrontation with another guest.  She did not handle it skillfully, so perhaps she sets the tone. On the good side, the rooms are large and bright and attractive – if you like the trendy, modern look.  We didn't try the sushi restaurant.  The breakfasts were not as good as what we experienced elsewhere. I'd definitely recommend the other hotels over this one -- especially the Duque and the Magnolia."
1893,"These apartments are ideal to see all the main attractions, you can walk or take the underground that is very close by. The rooms are clean but the only downside was that it was more of a hotel room than apartment but this didn't spoil our experience. Overall a very good stay. "
1894,We stayed at the hotel in mid-November. We were there three nights. The first night we woke to a large pool of water. There were issues with the AC.We were moved. AC was not repaired in the second room. There was a broken window. We were moved it a third room. The AC did not work and we could not sleep.
1895,"When I first entered the hotel room, I was surprised that the deadbolt in my room did not work.  I asked for a new room, and they obliged with a new room.  Great.  Okay.  2nd room, again the deadbolt didn't work, so I phoned down to them.  I got the manager, Andy.  He said that there was a black button that should trigger, and the deadbolt should engage.  I tried to press the button and the deadbolt popped out, so I closed the door.  The deadbolt engaged and... would not disengage.  I was locked IN my room.  I phoned down, and he came up but couldn't open the door.  The engineer came (within 15 minutes) and crowbarred the door open.  I told Andy there was no way I would stay in that room, so I got a new room.  The THIRD room (which was bigger) had a deadbolt that engaged…"
1896,We arrived in Miami with our 5 kids. We had booked two ocean view rooms and paid for them in January. When we arrived they didn’t have our rooms connecting as they had promised and also charged us for a second time even though we had already paid in advance. We had to wait 5 days to get our money back. We had to wait for an hour while they found two rooms that were connecting. I will say the concierge was very nice and gave our kids towels and pool toys to use while we waited for our rooms to be ready. This is definitely an older hotel and very dated. They should replace the carpeting in the rooms. The mattresses did not have full mattress protectors. The bathrooms were very dirty with a lot of mold/mildew. You could definitely hear people in the room next door and in the…
1897,"My husband and I booked Hilton Copacabana hotel for 5 night being awere that it is primarily a business hotel, but despite the fact we were attracted by the location.  We are still ""guests"" of this ""hotel"" but I wished I had never booked it!  We had to ask for dressing gowns & slippers because apparently they don't provide them despite the fact it's meant to be a 5* hotel. Also we had to ask for our room to be cleaned which I told it is mandatory for any hotel. We also had to ask for our mini bar and coffee to be restock. I just don't know how we will manage to stay here for another 3 nights. We spent our time dialing the reception! The hotel is very dated and noone knows what is going on!  Absolutely ridiculous!!!"
1898,"The hotel was little but close to the metro station and place de la republique ( metro stops and bus stops) restaurants in the same street a great bakery around the corner and a supermarket across the street. Staff was more than helpful they spoke french and english and spanish and were just really nice and great. rooms are tiny but so comfortable...and clean too.  lived it, would stay here again."
1899,"So first let me start with the pros-the location is great its right on Copacabana beach and very close to all of the main sights in Rio. Ubers are very cheap and can be found regularly. The bell boys are helpful and the breakfast is really good with a wide choice of food in the morning. They also welcomed us in with champagne and truffles for a special anniversary.  However, we had a few issues with our stay which is why we are giving it a 2. Firstly, this is not a 4* hotel-its more like a 3*. The shower does not warm up properly, and whenever the toilet flushes it all comes up the toilet and always smells of sewage. The door card never worked, so on multiple occasions every single day for 5 nights during our stay we had to come downstairs to get a new card. Not only was this…"
1900,"This delightful hotel on a quiet street in St Germain was the perfect choice for my daughter and me.  We were greeted by their suburb staff.  Patricia and Irene as well as the other front desk staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.  We had a junior suite which was large by any standards and allowed us to spread out with our large suitcases. The breakfast in the morning was just right for our needs. I just need coffee and something quick but they offered eggs, sausage and potatoes if you like a bigger breakfast.  The bathroom was large and what the pictures do not show is the rainfall shower head from above which was great.  The only small issue I had were the neighbors above us who seemed to be moving their furniture around and talking loudly.  Once they were quiet however,…"
1901,"Ok ... Lets say like this, its called element and it got the real element look already to it .. now, The front desk very nice, friendly, place is clean, the lobbly is comfy to stay in even if you checking in late or checking out early.  Lets talk about the rooms ( or studio ), its kinda studio apartment hotel, its nice .. you get a kitchen, few tools like cups and spoons and all that sort of things, bed is SO damn amazing .. so comfy, I really mean it ... got a nice sitting area as sofa .. you also have a small desk as you can also have guest sit with you as ( dining table ) and use it as a desk as well.   The bath is ok ... got nothing beside towels and hair dryer, and to be honest, I was in 3 stars hotel and they supply cream, hair stuff .. like real shampoo and cond. and some…"
1903,"My stay in Windsor Copa Hotel at RDJ with the Windsor Copa Hotel was alright. The hotel staffs were helpful but extremely strict. The hotel staffs did allowing us (my friends and I) to bring guests to the hotel. I find this practice was a bit absurd!   In addition, I believe that the hotel staff(s) had cloned my MasterCard information for fraudulent purpose. Simply during my stay, I had been really careful with using my credit card information in RDJ, Brazil. Furthermore, I had written to the Windsor Copa Hotel management but receive no response whatsoever. I am utterly disappointed with my experience in the Windsor Copa Hotel. If you decide to stay at Windsor Copa Hotel, I would suggest to think twice!!"
1904,We stayed one night at Just Style on our way from Nice to Malaga. It is just across the road from the main Barcelona Sants train station so is conveniently situated whether just passing through or if you want to see the sights but want to be out of the hustle & bustle of downtown Barcelona. It is also a lot cheaper than downtown hotels. The facilities are very modern & slick with the only downside being the poor quality Internet. We would recommend it.
1905,"I most say I was with high expectations of this hotel due to the professional pictures and location advertized on the hotels.com and maybe that is why I felt so disappointed in the end. Everybody seemed very friendly and helpful, but there were some things I did not really appreciatte to hear when I was doing the walking to my room with the front desk agent. Due to the pictures I thought the rooms were beautiful and I thought I would stay in a clean and bright room. Our room was in the entrance level and we only had a bit of a window which felt claustrophobic. To help, the shower smelled like old locker rooms.   The location was great but I must say I saddly felt disappointed with the whole experience."
1906,"Let's just say our visit to The W was HORRENDOUS!  Waste of money, waste of time, and body shaming garbage.  We knew about the cost of parking beforehand.  It's $60 if you're wondering.. PER DAY!  Yea.. um.. bwaha.  That's the cost of a good meal.  Moving on.. checking in wasn't painless, it was rude and sucked the life out of me in the form of a woman who obviously grew up in the ghetto and who had a chip on her shoulder.  The bellhop waited with his hand out and I didn't ask for help.. big no no.  The room?  Air conditioner falling off the wall.. light bulbs out in fixtures.. scuffs all over the walls.. mold in the recently renovated bathroom.. handprints all over the glass throughout the room on the desk and the walls.  Best part?  Before the time you have to check out,…"
1907,"Wanted an hotel close to Ibirapuera Park and choose this one. Really disappointed.  The rooms are very basic and with an awful AC. Old, really badly located and extremely noisy.  The location is excellent, the service is fine... but the rooms need an improvement."
1908,"Beautiful place, really inspiring and friendly staff. But the bed was really uncomfortable (they came to fix the base, but the mattress was bent), we found trash from previous guests, and keys stopped working every day. "
1909,We recently stayed in the Titanic Chaussee over the Christmas period and had a really lovely stay. The relaxing feel to the hotel was well received and it was lovely and quiet. The room was very comfy and we actually enjoyed it so much we decided to order in one evening and stay in the room. There is also a tube station outside the front door = bonus!
1910,"We recently stayed here, and we were a bit unsure before arriving, how it would be! We were greeted warmly, and treated with the kindest respect even though I know we looked worse for wear when we walked in! 😂 Long flight + rain + train +rain +metro + getting lost to find the hotel all while dragging our luggage! 😂😂😂  (I wish I could remember all the names of the people that helped us, but I know I will mess them up!)  But seriously, Le Royal, your people are your best asset! They were soo kind, and sooo helpful, and so tolerable of my very rusty and very bad French!  Our room was adorable, the bed was incredibly comfortable, the bathroom was awesome! Lots of counter space, and the shower was great!! They are located just across the street from an adorable boulangerie, very…"
1911,"We just spent 4 nights in the junior suite.  I understand that some of the rooms are small in this hotel (like most Paris hotel rooms) but the suite was a good size with a separate room for a shower and large Jacuzzi ,  sitting area.   The room was delightful.  We had a couple of issues learning our way around the shower controls and lighting but otherwise the room was perfect for our needs.   The service at this small hotel is friendly and very helpful.    The hotel is also very well located, close to all the action but in a quiet neighborhood.   I would recommend this hotel and next time we are in Paris we will definitely being staying their again!"
1912,"3 nights without proper sleep since my room faced the street. I was never so much looking forward to leave a hotel. also noisy in our conference room - no noise protection at all, next to the restaurant with talking people and loud music. "
1913,"To stay at this hotel in Lisbon was a very positive experience, the employees were very friendly and helpful. The Hotel and the rooms was nice and comfortable and the breakfast was of a good quality, so all in one I can certainly recommend this Hotel."
1914,"Stayed here for 4 nights. The location of the hotel is excellent, there are loads of restaurants and shops at a walking distance. The breakfast is fine although somewhat limited (normal, as the hotel is small) looking at the area, if not included in the room rate, I would personally have breakfast elsewhere. The rooms are well decorated and cosy, although tend to be on the small side.  The rooftop terrace is quite nice and serve some nice cocktails and some food. The views are somewhat limited when sat down, but has some sunbeds (like 4 or 5) and has a tiny pool (maybe the size of a big hot tub) where one can sunbathe."
1915,"We made our booking via Hotel.com, stating that we were 3 children (even the ages were stated) and 2 adults. At the hotel we were not accommodated according to our booking. The hotel did not even have a room suitable for 5 people! Our room had but a queen size bed and a small pull-out sofa. Hotel Management told us that they would never have accepted our booking had we gone via the hotel directly, and that our problem with our booking lay with Hotels.com. They even tried charging us extra for the pull-away bed that had to be put in. Also the bathroom was filthy and tiny. The breakfast was poor, and indoor seating was not available. We had to sit outside in the miserable cold and rain."
1917,"This  Hotel is the ""nicest"" in the area & what a huge shame.  If they had any competition they would go out of business.  This Hotel is all about the money - they don't think or care about recognizing or personalizing their customers needs.  We stayed there on business for over a month - paying A LOT of money.  They still charged us a flat fee of $15. U.S. a day for Internet.  We tried to address this issue w/ a manager many times - we called, emailed etc...then we got a typed letter under our door saying that they reviewed this request but the answer is ""no"".        After staying in this Hotel for over a month,  not ONE staff member used our name!  This was our ""home away from home"", but no one made it feel like that.      The service around the pool is appalling.  We always…"
1918,Something a bit different and as featured in Travel Man: 48 Hours in Berlin. Enjoyed the elevators with different music chosen by the staff. Right on the waterfront and by part of the East side of the Berlin wall.
1919,"The hotel is horrible, poorly sign posted, the rooms are dated, bathrooms from the 1970s and restaurant in a terrible room, but the food was actually ok. Even if the location in the airport tempts you do NOT stay here ever!"
1920,"I think it's been a while since The College was first refurbished and opened. From the outside, the hotel looks cool and we really liked the location and area. The checkin process was a little strange in that you have to chose your breakfast from a menu the day before. The reception service was no better than ok for the stay.  Room wise, again ok, needs to be 're decorated and the bathroom was so so with so so products. Air con was broken meaning we had to endure road noise with window open. Still we slept ok.  Breakfast is ok. The was they serve it means you have to many things on table at once and it lacks subtly. Big slabs of bread and no butter etc...  The hotel is alright. Good location. Boutique ish. There are probably better for the price. Rooms need to be refurbished."
1921,"Once again we stayed at Les Plumes. And once again it was wonderful. Location is fantastic for this hotel. 2 Metro lines going east-west, north-south, both within a short walk, little bistros, even a grocery store around the corner which was great when we came back for a little happy hour in their courtyard before heading out again. We had a group of 6 of us. The staff couldn't be nicer or more accommodating. They arrange transfers and lunch & dinner reservations. Service is a priory with them and they are very friendly about providing that service. Without a doubt a ""hidden"" gem in Paris."
1922,"The front desk wasn’t too friendly to us. Maybe we are Asian Chinese perhaps. Feeling bad for sometimes. But overall still okay. Everyone speak better English compare to some other European countries. But the in room facilities was very limited. No fridge, no toiletries besides shower gel and hair shampoo and soap. No tissue provided.   Location was great. Just next to the metro station and few station away from the Amsterdam Central."
1923,"*horrible experience*:   honestly, our experience at the Clift hotel sucked. i would NOT recommend anyone staying there. Here's why:   What bothered us the most was the fact that you feel that they are trying to take advantage of you, the whole time! They are trying to get your money and overcharge you in the most sneaky (and honestly sketchy) wats.   As soon as you're checking in they inform you of this very sneaky ""Resort Fee"" that is (of course) mandatory. ""Resort"" is obviously a euphemism because this ain't no resort. The fee is $30 a day and it covers internet (?) and a ""conveniente"" $10 voucher that ""you can use at our bar!"" (so they charge you a fee to be able to spend your own money on things you don't want) Also, if you don't spend your $10 daily, they go to waste.…"
1924,"This is typical fare from Marriott, exactly what you expect from this standard of hotel. It is a little pricy but a good location and a very good executive lounge on the 10th floor with a good breakfast Buffett. However, the best part is the steak restaurant. It really is very good and although the service was a little slow when I was there, the food was excellent and well worth a visit."
1925,"Yes, it was Lollapalooza weekend and the hotel was crowded. Yes, I understand you have to have extra security measures.  But for a Hilton Honors member of 10+ years to be treated the way my family and I were treated at this hotel is an embarrassment to Hilton as a company.  First, you refused to let my daughter up to the room because she had no key. You also refused to let her call me or called me for her, and I was in the room! so you could verify.  Then you sent her to the security office where she cried until you sent her with a security guard up to the room, where the guard entered the room (that I was in!) without knocking or announcing herself and demanded that my daughter show her proof of ID even though I was right there in the room!!!  I received the weakest apology…"
1926,Beautiful hotel in nice surroundings. A very likeable hotel with attentive staff and clean rooms. Small cosy bar and spa that we didn’t have time to visit. Too much to do in Paris! Will stay in Bastille next time too!
1927,"The room was nice and clean..,however the hotel is not very centrally located (you need to catch a train to get to the city centre), but is very closed to the Arena and the Ziggo Dome. So if your main aim is to visit the city, you probably would find this hotel quit inconvenient.  What was pretty unusual is that when I checked in they gave me some ear plugs because there was a disco party in the hall of the hotel... also the breakfast is quite special: in the early morning they leave you a little bag in front of the door containing your breakfast - that's all. "
1928,"The room was way too expensive. It is dark, stinks like old socks and wet dog (had to wash our clothes because they were smelling so badly after leaving the hotel!!), the sink in the bathroom constantly overflows - the drainage system is plugged over and over again -  the owner knows about the problem for a long time..., and on top the owner is very unfriendly.   Never again !!!"
1929,"If you’re looking to stay close to Oia but like to avoid the crowds, this is a lovely location to stay. Sunset view in a little village nearby, no traffic possible.  The hotel aims at a luxury concept, but in that perception there are some improvements that can be made. At 380 euros a night, breakfast is quite poor. They serve it in your private terrace, which is nice. However, the food is pre made and served cold. You cannot choose what you would like to eat, and if you’re a difficult eater then that’s quite frustrating. We had the executive villa with an indoor cave jacuzzi. Its absolutely beautiful but it also makes your room very hot and humid and you cannot leave the AC on when you leave the room.  The swimming pool is quite a walk down hill, and doesn’t have a pool bar. It…"
1930,I stayed at this hotel for a conference in Lisbon. The location of the hotel is good. Quite central. The room was ok in size but the linen and interiors looked jaded. The service is poor. I asked for my laundry to be picked up at 7 in the morning and the reply was that there is no one to pick it up before 8 and no solution was offered like please leave it in room and they will arrange to pick it up. Slow room service too. They also looked short staffed. 
1931,"Words will not adequately express the gratitude I have for the incredible staff at this hotel, who IMHO went above and beyond anything I've ever witnessed, truly salvaging our recent holiday.  My dear husband and I recently spent 8 nights at the Max Hotel, our first long-awaited trip to Paris.  Now, to preface this review, I want to say my husband and I are in our late 50s and early 60s, fairly well-traveled folks...we've been around.  Well, I can echo ALL the positives about this Hotel, undoubtedly.  The hotel is adorable, funky, accommodating, cozy, clean, quirky, etc, etc.  As a boutique hotel, it is top-notch.  Located in the 14th arrondissement in Paris, a predominantly residential neighborhood, my husband and I found the location perfect, as we always stay away from…"
1932,"This hotel has a few good features, however unfortunately their staff is not one of them. The staff here are extremely unfriendly and distant, so unlike the wonderful hospitality we experienced in the rest of Vietnam. Would definitely not recoomed this hotel despite its good location."
1933,My wife booked a reservation at this hotel weeks ago and gets a call the day before saying they have overbooked and they cannot take her.  One hour so sar into room reservation beaurocracy and no solution yet.
1934,"We spent a week in this hotel in August 2012. The hotel is a simple 4stars hotel, with a great view to the ocean. It is clean, maybe recently renovated, but nothing special. There is a small beach about 200 meters from the hotel, but if you want to enjoy the ocean, you may travel a few kilometers to Porto Moniz, Calheta, or Porto da Cruz."
1935,"I remember this stay a charming. Professional helpfull staff, fine rooms and a proper breakfast! Nothing too fancy, not a gym or pool, but the rooms were just very good. The area is lovely and you'll be able go anywhere quite easily and swiftly. A very fine hotel!"
1936,The sub station is across the street. Most interesting activities and tour places are within walking distance. There is a sauna but no pool  The rooms are clean and quiet but the. Building is old and needs some electric help. The air conditioning works but is not cool enough for us 
1937,"$50 extra charge for ""linen and presence of kitchen"", $25 charge for lost key card, no cleaning for duration of stay, minimal toiletries only given on first day, not even kleenexes in the room. The place is dirty and run down, there are many stains on carpet, walls are dirty and chipped, elevator very dirty. The bed had no side table, no night light. The TV was on the window sill.  The internet was terrible, extremely slow, I could not use it. No front desk staff for the night and the front desk is indeed just a desk in a corridor!  It was not possible to adjust the temperature in the room and the air conditioning was very loud. There was even a charge for moving the furniture! It ranks as one of the 3 worst hotels I have ever stayed in. I heard instead that the nerby hostel was…"
1938,"this hotel needs to train their employees better. the front desk was awful! the first room had broken matress, the front desk sent someone up to check. the other employee told the front desk that the matress was indeed broken. the front desk didnt want switch us to another room until the other employee advocated for us. then, at check out, the same guy on the front desk wasnt willing to print us a copy of reciept. he argued with us for 5 min just for a copy of reciept. moreover, the maid in our room was so lazy. she only made our bed n replenish the towels. all the garbage we had on the table was left at where it was. very disappointed about this hotel. will never visit again! "
1939,"I booked a 5 night stay, checking in on July 22dn  When me and my wife arrived they gave us 3 rooms, all of the were dusty and smelled bad, the argument the front desk used was ""this is a 120 year old hotel"" not only that only one room had aircon and it didn't work properly  The lady at the front desk was rude, only the bellboy was very helpful"
1940,"Clean and nice hostel to stay a few nigths. Jose and his son were really friendly and tried to be helpful. I like heating in the room, especially during the cold nights, and quiet around the hostel. Ufortunately the hostel is pretty far away from metro station. Moreover communication was hard beacause we don't know spanish and Jose doesn't know english."
1941,We stayed here for one night after a Viking Cruise. The hotel was clearly not prepared for the number of guests considering it was warned well in advance when and how many people would be arriving. Aldo when checking out again the queue means that it took us 45 mins to check out. This hotel needs more staff at busy times. 
1943,"My husband and I booked a room here for us and one for my sister New Year's weekend after an extended stay with family in a private apartment. Although the rooms were small and our bed was indeed two singles pushed together as another reviewer noted, we liked this hotel very much. My husband is a cigar smoker, so the cigar lounge was a happy surprise for us. It's a very comfortable, nice lounge with a bar. It is true that the hotel does smell a bit like cigar smoke, however, I didn't really notice it until someone pointed it out to me (probably because I am accustomed to the smell). We found the hotel comfortable, and the buffet breakfast (complimentary with our room) was good. The location of the hotel was great - it's within walking distance of two jazz bars (Quasimodo and…"
1944,The room was clean.  The bathroom was nice.  The TVs were good other than the channel descriptions were not very informative.  I had a nice corner room except one of the windows has the  view of some sort of balcony that I didn't want to open the drape because of privacy.  I think this kind of window is totally useless.
1945,"During our 3 weeks in Vietnam, this was the worst hotel we stayed at.  We were with a tour group and stayed here for 2 nights.  The decor was dated but that's fine.  This was clean.  Breakfast was OK and service from reception and its area were great.  But the water pressure for the shower was the worst.  This was a little bit better than dripping.  And there was only one time for 5 minutes that suddenly water pressure was good/normal, so I knew that this was nothing to do with the water pipes or the hose.  May be this was just this room or the wing we stayed at."
1947,"I liked the management, I liked the 6-bed female dorm, I liked the well-stocked kitchen, I liked the super-clean sheets and duvets, and the tables out in the lobby to sit and chill or eat. If you are not a smoker, though, be forwarded that there is a lot of cigarette smoke that filters through the halls and lobby of the hostel, due to the smokers sitting right in front of the hostel at a picnic table. The smoke gets sucked into the hostel through the open door, and I personally found it really annoying (and unhealthy)."
1948,"The hotel is quite far from the city center and the walk to the next metro station is longer than it seems on the map. The staff is always friendly, however, can be a bit slow at times. The rooms are spacious and really clean. Overall the hotel is alright, but a bit expensive for what you get. "
1949,"I have been on vacation to Porto two times before, and this time I was here for business. So I was not entirely free in my hotel choice. Let me say, Vila Galé is a solid place to stay for a few days on a business trip. I wouldn't consider it for vacations, mostly because of its location a bit east of the center, within a not-so-nice area of Porto.  The hotel itself is an architectural nightmare, gray-brown concrete in a grey environment. The lobby is pretty and modern, with a nice bar. The crew is friendly, but sometimes seemed a bit helpless and unfortunate with their management's decisions.   The whole bad-service-decisions start right at the check-in: You get requested to pay the whole accomodation, and thus basically do a check-out procedure, before you actually check in. Of…"
1950,"This is a good hotel. This is a decent hotel. But, it was not what I expected. For years I stayed in Sheraton Amsterdam airport. This time, I wanted some changes. I must admit, I did not look carefully and I did not read the reviews. I just assumed that since the price is higher than the airport hotel, that I will be getting a nicer better fancier hotel. I was wrong. Again, I say, this is a good hotel and this is a decent hotel. But, when you have something in your mind and it turns out to be different, then you get disappointed a bit. This is what happened to me. The breakfast is very very limited. It is more of a boutique hotel than your regular one. It is in a nice residential area so you feel as if you are living like a local. The rooms have fully equipped kitchens which is…"
1952,"We have been to Funchal on two previous occasions, and enjoy the island, but would certainly not consider this hotel again. Visited 4-11 November for a relaxing holiday, and had specifically requested a quiet room, (Jnr. Suite)but had very similar experience to previous feedback from Elaine W. After first night of incessant barking we complained to hotel staff, who were well aware of the issue, but appeared unable to help. Our sleep was disrupted, and the dogs barked intermittently, day and night, to the point where our holiday was seriously marred.  We subsequently spoke to, and formally recorded our complaint with Thomson Rep who claimed she had not had any similar complaints, and offered no assistance. We submitted our extensive feedback in writing to the hotel on…"
1953,"My Hilton experience was desimated by a front desk representative named Marcus.  He was extremely rude, condescending, and cavalier about our interactions.  When I informed him I was planning to write a review he said go ahead and his boss wouldn’t care.  I will not be staying here ever again and this strongly affects my views on Hilton hotels and hiring practices."
1954,"I stayed here with my husband and son over a weekend in November. The apartment is a good size and quite pretty, but there was a sort of mouldy smell, which the hotel obviously knew about, as the windows were open when we arrived and it was early November! The smell suggested that the carpets and upholstery need a good wash. Also there were ants in the kitchen, which wasn't ideal, particularly as we had our baby boy's food and milk. Also there were no cribs available for our 11 month old boy. When we asked for a crib, we were told they only had one and it was being used. That said, the location is good and the staff are friendly. Wifi isn't great though"
1955,"Really damage to be received like that as a Platinum member! As said by the Lady at the reception: yes we well have a suite available, but sure your normal room is better! Don’t need a suite... sorry, but is not a good sign if the hotel have said that their suite are not so good! Let customers appreciate or not that! In addition, room service alter 22h30 with middle food and bad service. I would say that restaurant was ok as well the bar, but not sure that I will choice again SOFITEL in Lisboa still I am Platinum member!! It is well a Pity..."
1956,"With all of the add-ons, the price for this hotel is one expected of a far nicer hotel.  Staff, though, was great.  Gaico at front desk in particular and the day manager.  $30 mandatory daily charge for internet, the health club, etc???  $25 for a mini frig??  Very skimpy bath amenities.  Comfortable bed though."
1957,"Im staying in a really high priced „business“ room, as nothing else was available. The room had its best days in the  90s. The bathroom is dirty and the color is falling from the ceiling. There is a coffee maker, but not even a bottle of water. The shop in the basement closes at 11."
1958,The room is good but the service is shocking. We ordered two dishes from the dining menu. The bill given to me missed a transaction and we told the concierge that we should be charged extra. She couldnt understand me at all where i clearly conveyed a spaghetti dish is not on the bill and she keeps on thinking it is another steak sandwich. She then went on saying that she will verify our menu later after we leave the hotel and just charge it to my credit card. Why do i have to pay extra credit card fees when crown made a mistake and i told them about it and the staff wont address it on the spot. Please train your staff properly as I am not impressed with this poor service.
1959,"Stayed for a week to clear some time from our timeshare bank so it only cost us a few points. Access for cars is awkward as you have to park near the gate then get out of the car to press the intercom to open them. Parking is very tight with only about 25 spaces and not much room to manoeuvre. We were given a ground floor studio room with partial kitchen. Beds were rock hard and pillows provided no support so sleeping was difficult. Floors are tiled so there was quite a lot of noise from the people above us when they moved chairs, tables or walked in shoes etc. Somuch for a relaxing break.  The room got a few hours in direct sun from around 11 to 2pm. Nice views over the garden and on to the sea. Two chairs ands table meant beers on the balcony was comfortable. There were also…"
1960,"Lead off with the highlights that the locations was good directly across from the beach, breakfast was solid and the pool was nice albeit very exposed to the wind.  That unfortunately is where it ends. Our room was a virtual disaster. The shower screen was broken which meant the bathroom completely flooded. The toilet blocked up completely and the air conditioning was non existent. To the level that was asked it to get looked at. Front of house staff came up, agreed with the issues and said they would move us in 5 minutes. An hour later I called the reception to find out progress at which time they sent someone to move us. Mind you it was 9pm by this time. The new room was the same size and had issues with any consistency with the air conditioning. To the level that we had to…"
1961,We was looking forward to staying in the centre of Da Nang. Unfortunately our stay was very pleasant. The Room was very damp and felt very damp soon as we got taken to it. For the price we payed you would off expected it to be a bit cleaner and damp free. We have stayed in hostels half the price and felt a lot more satisfied. There was mould around the shower head and around the sink.
1962,"Our stay in Paris is perfect with Acacias Etoile Hotel. The hotel is 3-5 minutes walk to Arc de triomph, and the traffic is convient. The Staffs are nice and considerate, and rooms are clean. We would absolutely recommend it to our friends!"
1963,"I stayed 10 days - clean and modern rooms - good taxi service. Room for improvement. Breakfast - included in last 2 days of my stay- was not properly registered with the dinning room resulting in time spent back and forth with the reception in the morning. Breakfast was buffet was plentifull but of generally plain quality. Phone call rates are distastefully  high for our times of almost free phone rates - R$ 3.58/ minute to local cell phone after the first minute and R $ 13.81 a minute to cells in Europe. I received  a letter from hotel asking to go to reception to settle a Reais $2500 bill 2 days before the end of my stay eventhough they had R $4,000 retained in amex account. When I got there they changed their mind, but  time was lost  in the reception in the morning to get to…"
1964,We have been stayong at this hotel for 3 years in a row for business purposes. I manage a group of 50 people and the hotel staff have always looked after us extremely well. No complaints. Also it's not in a central location but it is within walking distance to the subway and lots of restaurants and shops around
1965,"Le Grey hotel had great beds and excellent bathrooms.... along with an excellent lobby and breakfast bar setup. It’s a bit of a walk from the main tourist areas, but we were fine with exploring the city. Definitely recommend it!"
1966,"We had a lovely room on the 11th floor, until my partner took a shower and the whole thing flooded, as it must have been blocked. We notified reception and without hesitation we were given another room on the 4th floor. The room we were moved to not only smelt soooo bad but it was freezing cold because the heating didn't work nor did we have a coffee machine in this room. So, basically we were downgraded through no fault of our own. Already a poor start. Next, we ordered room service which was so overpriced for the quality of the food but it arrived COLD...how can you serve cold meat? (burger-standard basic food, costing approx 20euros each) ridiculous!!!! the plates and tray were left in our room for 2 whole days (that we stayed in this hotel) even after the cleaner 'cleaned'…"
1967,"My flight was cancelled and called hotel to cancel my room and they said no way. They needed 24 hours to cancel it and all 3 people I talked to was obnoxious, rude and had no time to even try to help with me."
1968,"Nice location on the main tourist avenue, perhaps should have looked for a more charming hotel...   Staff is nice.  Rooms and hotel are very dark...  We also had an ants problem.  Very noisy from the street noise too."
1970,"Great, super staff, perfect location, great for fun, relax and solo travelers.  Nice mix, well located, great mix people, comfort beds. All you need for your stay and to get involved with the staff, you can have an amazing time 100%."
1971,"We had a lovely big room with view which was very clean. however the mini bar and coffee facilities were a joke. The food experience in the Buffet was good although sometimes over crowded, Did not experience other restaurants as they were closed and when  Campo de Fiori was open for just one night this was fully booked. There was only one member of staff serving at the main bar  and with queues up to 20 plus on a regular basis at one time other staff were provided and this did certainly help.  The so called cocktails were served in  small whisky glasses a first for us!! On the plus side the pool area was good although , loungers in the adult only area were pretty uncomfortable.  However the poolside snacks were good with lots of variety and it was re filled on a frequent basis"
1972,The rooms are extremely clean and very well kitted out. The hosts are very well organised and are super friendly. The bed and breakfast is conveniently located. All in all a very pleasant stay and I would definitely return. 
1974,First the place is beautiful and I would have to say rather clean. It’s not the newest place in south beach but it well kept.  But it pretty much ends there.  First the pool rules are completely ridiculous.  You can’t hold chairs more the 45 minutes but that seems not to apply.  You get to the pool to only find out that they have zero chairs available and have Amore people visiting the property then the can possibly accommodate.  The main pool has a limit of 240 people and has not even half of that in chairs available in the pool area.  They closed down part of the pool area for a private party taking away unknown how many chairs.   So now you choice is go lay on the beach and pay for a umbrella or stay at the pool and pay 500-1000 dollars a day for a cabana.  This is on top of…
1975,"Our first approach was not very good because I rented a car and the hotel does not have parking, you have to do it by your self. Need to drop the baggage off the car in the avenue and then park by my self. It is very close but in a 5 star hotel the should do it as a service. Even though, the assistance and service of the people in the front desk was always very good. Trying to help. Arriving to our room there was a very bad smell coming from the bathroom I called to the front desk and they sent right away a person to clean the it. Never smell bad again. Facilities are fine enough considering that your are out most of the time, has a nice view to one of the main avenues in Lisbon. For a 3 day staying breakfast become boring. Is the same everyday. It is in a great location, its…"
1977,"Sadly this was out first hotel in San Francisco and it was not a pleasant experience.  The hotel was dinghy, hot with no Air-con, dirty and the rooms were not very secure.  The breakfast was terrible as was the service.  The only day I saw a staff member at the hotel was on day 5 when we left.  The lift took forever to travel 4 floors and broke down on a regular basis.  The bathroom was tiny and there was absolutely NO room for toiletries.  Because of the America's Cup being on at the time, the hotel charged top dollar and we were bitterly disappointed.  We could have stayed at a 5 star hotel in Australia for less."
1978,"Good: Breakfast was fine, there was A/C in the room, its a 5-10 min drive from the airport.  Bad: First, the internet was horrendous - couldn't even connect!! Then, the bed sheets were super uncomfortable. The room wasn't very renovated/nice.   If you are looking for a very basic three star hotel next to the airport, this is your place. I wouldn't want to spend any more time than that here, though!"
1979,"Hotel is in the new commercial center of Lisabon.For reaching the old town quarter,ca & km good walk.All the practical facilities are available,typical an Olympic city  as everywhere. Small,and only 2 lifts,when one lft is out of order,then chaos. Chamber is small,because the 2 sepatated beds are too big! Air Condition is good and quiet. Breakfast is OK. ,I  prefer the excellent fruits! Hotel Restaurant is not so good as they promised. Day trips offers are with quality. The HOTEL TEAM IS FRIENDLY; There is no public telefon boot in the hotel lobby. In conclusion: its practical and good for your money."
1980,Stayed here on a business trip. The excellent reviews were confirmed during the visit.  Very convenient for trains & many good restaurants within short walking distance. Excellent breakfast & very clean & comfortable! Would definitely return.
1981,"New hotel, only couple of years old. So you can expect all the advantages of new branch. Beautiful interior, nice looking wellness area, although only one type of sauna and one steam was little bid disappointment, comparing to other modern hotels in the world. They know, that trendy is at least 3 different types of saunas and other stuff. But on the other hand, this is a business hotel in Berlin, not spa resort in mountains. Breakfast pretty amazing, very well organized. Building superbly located on U bahn and train station, across the street ZOO. Even standard room is beautiful, with SPECTACULAR view if you ask for it and heated floor in the bathroom, as well as bathtub and shower separated. Did not try the restaurants though - Hard Rock Cafe is very close, which was choice…"
1983,"Location is very good, in the center of Old Riga, but very close to airport bus stop and Riga bus station. Clean room,  tasty breakfast. Despite the fact that my room was facing street with at least two night clubs, I didn't hear any noise.  They tried to charge me for the water and juice that I had not taken, I had no time to persuade them that was definitely a mistake (almost missed my bus) so had to pay for a juice that someone else drank. Though it was small amount of money, I feel extremely disappointed. I would never choose this hotel again. "
1984,"Don't come before 25th January 2017  We purposely moved from Langham hotel where we spent 4 nights to Grand Kempinski Hotel mainly because we wanted to try your scenic pool.   When we arrived, the pool was closed due to renovation, and won't be opening again until 25th Jan. No information prior to our arrival. No communication was announced on your homepage Nor when we made a booking. We actually did call and asked about the pool on 25 December when we were doing research on which hotel to stay, no one informed us that the pool will be closed.   We were very disappointed as the pool was our main reason of coming and we expected 5 stars Hotel to always communicate clearly on all channels so the guests have right expectation towards their stay.   On top of that, we called and…"
1985,"We recently had 4 nights here, and the hotel charges you every day for tea, coffee, sugar and milk replacement.  We have never encounted this when travelling the world. We found several of reception staff very unfriendly and an effort to help. Also horel does not supply  hotel book,  giving establishment info or surrounding information (transport/restaurants/places of interest) First timers to Lisbon I would not suggest this hotel unless you want a big room."
1986,A beautiful place with very nice rooms. The only challenge is the kitchen where the quality does not live up to expectations and the wine list is full of wines that does not exist in the wine celler !!!So a very nice place but there is room for some major improvement.
1987,"Reserved a suite for business.  Arrived and was treated like I was a bother.  Plus, he said there is no late checkout because I was in a suite.  The “suite” as it turned out was simply two mediocre smallish adjoining rooms with a view of the roof.  The table was very dirty and there was no water or any of the normal SPG member goodies.     This is the second Sheraton stay in a row that I have been very disappointed.   For the price, you can do much better than this this Sheraton in Chicago.    "
1988,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful stay at NH Campo Grande. The hotel is not close to downtown Lisbon, however the subway is right across from the hotel. The housekeeping was very good and friendly. I do not recommend room service, as the costs were not worth the quality of the food. A special thanks to front desk employee Diogo, who was so friendly and took time to answer all our question and went out of his way to help us. A+ service! wifi was not very good and to have better wifi you have to pay 10 euros for 24 hours. The gym was hardly a gym. Breakfast was sub par."
1989,"More than terrible. This was our worst hotel experience EVER.   Noisy disruptive and no room cleaning due to striking workers and a management who just do not care about their clients. No rate reductions offered or given despite the many disappointments during our stay. Shower drains backed up , lack if services and long delays to check in. Basically this hotel treats its paying guests with contempt and presumes that their clients will stay loyal, We would never use this hotel group again, they do not deserve any customer loyalty and there is plenty of choice out there. We would have cancelled our stay if possible but this proved impossible."
1990,damaging things We have so many problems about overflowing toilet two times and our things and close are damaged and wet nobody ask about clean our stuff and help us ! They clean a room and give us two cookies 🍪?!  It was very poor!  Also parking a car was 40$ +++per  night and nobody inform you about the costs .... 
1991,"Upon arrival I get my keys and check into my room. When entering the room I noticed a foul odor. I set my bags down and look around the room to see where it could be coming from. The first thing I noticed were wet spots on the chair. Then I realized that the carpets were also severely stained. The bellman had even mentioned there was a foul odor and offered to get my room changed. I get assigned a new room and the towels had strings hanging off of them, The sheets were dirty, and the TV had a poor signal. I had mentioned it was my birthday and they did nothing to acknowledge it. Valet had taken so long with my car I almost missed my Birthday dinner. Horrible stay, Dirty rooms, and poorly managed. The manager called me making a ton of excuses on why they messed up. He wasn't even…"
1992,Had a short business visit of only few sleeping hours spent in a comfortable large room with a nice bed. Had nice breakfast but I believe the food self-service area could be better organized. Very much recommend Hotel 
1993,"When I was searching for low-budget hotels, this was the best option. I've flown with EasyJet and it was so curious that now the company offers lodging! The first thing you need to know is that you cannot expect a big room, it's a fact that space is quite limited, and if you want a room with window you will pay extra for it. The bed is comfortable, and even when you don't have plenty space to move around, the room is an excellent choice to save money and have a good rest. The staff are very very nice and helpful, they are multilingual, I was lucky that the girl who helped us with the check in was from Spain and we spoke in Spanish! Location? I think you won't find a better option than this! Alexanderplatz is only around 10 minutes walking! In the lobby you will find maps in…"
1994,"Hotel is quite new and clean and the rooms, even the smallest rooms,are spacious. Breakfast was good as Scandic hotels usually have but it was little bit crowded so some people had to wait for free tables a while.  Location is good if you like shopping, KaDeWe is right next door and Primark and lots of other shopping abilities are also in a walking distance. With U bahn you can also easily reach alexandrplats and other tourist attractions.  Only downsides of our stay were that the floor drain in the shower wasn’t working properly and when I pre-ordered surprise sparkling wine and chocolate for my girlfriend’s birthday, there was only chocolate waiting for us in the room.   To sum up, very descend hotel with good location, nice rooms and friendly service!"
1995,"Went to Reids for a Champagne buffet  dinner on Sunday 23rd April and were very disappointed  as we turned up fifteen minutes early .I asked at reception and was told where to go for the Champagne Buffet .On arrival at the venue we were met in the bar ,by a young lady ,who explained that we were a little early ,and asked us if we would like a drink of Champagne  on the terrace.    She arrived and  there seemed to be a few other people there who we assumed to be part of the Champagne Buffet ,she brought us some canapés ,and a glass of Champagne  then we didn't see her for 45-50 minutes and Ii decided to check where the Buffet was being held. I found   the room and was surprised that the Buffet was already being served so went back to the Beautiful terrace to collect my wife  We…"
1997,"Do not understand how this can be a 5-star hotel. It would be OK as a low-key 4-star.  Check-in OK, although I noticed at check-out that they had lost all the information I had given them for invoicing purposes. Check-out slow and staff (only one who had to be called, since no one was at reception) could be much nicer.  Conclusion: you never have a second chance to give a first good impression. They were unable to give a good impression. There will be no second chance."
1998,"Soiled linen sat outside my door for days, even after I requested by phone to have it removed. There was ALWAYS trash outside the doors of other guests room for days. The line at the front desk was, believe it or not, over an hour long on two separate occasions. The room was never really clean. I have stayed at this hotel several times in the past and as a business owner I believe the problem is really with the management. "
1999,I spent a weekend here with my wife and 2 children. It was a fantastic stay. The staff provided good communication prior to my visit and were willing to help make our stay as pleasant and stress-free as possible. We stayed in connecting rooms that provided extra space to relax in as a family which was just perfect for us. The bottled water in our room on our arrival was just what was needed as it was a sweltering weekend in Paris. The location was perfect for us - a direct link to Gare du Nord for connection to Eurostar trains. The gardens across the road provided a tranquil start to our weekend with fun activities for the children and lovely sheltered walks to cool down in. Breakfast provided plenty of choice and was a great way to start the day. Some lovely restaurants in the…
2001,"Stayed one night only last week when bumped out of a neighbouring hotel because of 'overbooking'. Took the room over the entrance (101) because it had one of two large balconies in the hotel. Room well equipped, large, lovely view, good bathroom. Staff were exceptionally helpful and considerate, public areas fine but a little worn (old dried flower display, grubby leather sofa),  pool (indoor) looked enticing. Had buffet dinner on arrival evening in the most dismal of dining rooms. - no outside tables although it was 24 degrees plus at 8 pm. Restaurant ill-lit by those dull overhead lights that make you feel you are in a care home, no subtle lighting or candles and a very average meal on offer. Mostly couples and one or two larger parties. Very silent place. Not aware that there…"
2002,"We originally planned to stay in Chau Loan hotel for two nights but decided to cut our trip short.   The hotel is not as it appears in the photos. The swimming pool is grotty with stacks of inside furniture around it and there are only 4 sun beds!   The location is also poor, we struggled to find many places to eat around it and although it is situated near a beach, this is definitely not one of the nicer beaches in Nha Trang- there was rubbish floating in the sea and a huge sewage pipe leading into it.   Our room was okay on appearance, however after being in it a few hours we noticed the ants.. They were everywhere, coming in from the balcony door which left a huge gap to the outside. The ants had managed to get on and in the bed!  On discovering this the hotel staff were…"
2003,"Very nice room. It ends there. Bad breakfast (frequent rock hard leftover fried rice and eggs, poor selection, worst coffee in the world - like sewage, but not as tasty). Two channels in English (CIS, which flips back and forth between Chinese and the same 4 TV shows over and over), (CGTN-China govt news, which doesnt work half the time). Even the China channels stink, none of the nice music historical village animal archaeology etc. Ramada across the street is a 1970's stuffy business hotel, but breakfast great and many channels like Bloomberg, BBC, CNN, and pay per view 24 hr movie access. Why cant Hol Inn charge me money and let me watch something?"
2004,"First time to Amsterdam, we were upgraded on our arrival to the Rembrandt . The room suited us ok - ( we haven’t stayed at many hotels so not really sure what to expect ). The room was clean, the view was awful - we overlooked the back of other hotel rooms , but we didn’t expect to spend a lot of time in the room. The mini fridge has a sensor in it , we moved a few items to put our own bottle of water in . The next day we had a request to ‘ pay for items used’. We explained to reception , they tore up the letter with no issues . The room was cleaned each day , the bed was comfy , no external noise nuisance . Use of room safe was free. We never used the hotels other facilities, we went out for breakfast . It was a great base to explore , close to everything we needed.Room not the…"
2005,"My husband and I have just returned from a four night stay here last month. Had a really lovely stay and would recommend it to anyone considering a stay in Cannes. The hotel is immaculate and has a pleasant smell as you walk through the foyer! Pool area was clean and relaxing and breakfast was very nice. A good stocked selection each morning. The hotel is a little uphill but a free shuttle bus will take  you down to the seafront if you ask at reception. Personally, we enjoyed the walk, about 5 - 10 minutes each evening into town. Finally a special mention to the staff on reception, especially Caroline, who arranged to post my reading glasses home to me after I left them in the hotel room on departure. Thanks very much, I really appreciated your help. Hope to visit again soon!"
2006,"This hotel has a class of rooms called small subterranean and OMG are they small. I've probably stayed in 100 hotels by now and this is the smallest room I've ever seen in my whole life. There is probably a space of about 4 feet by 4 feet that is open within the room. The rest is occupied by the bed. There is no desk or closet or safe or hand towel rack. Trust me, do not book this room. We were only there two nights and I literally felt like a king when I arrived in Brussels because the room was a normal size. A hotel that is this nice and trendy really shouldn't have a room class like this at all.  As long as you book a normal size room here - you'll be fine. The lobby is very trendy and hip. The breakfast was continental only but it was good. The check-in guy was nice.  The…"
2007,"Aitana is location at a 10min freezing walk from the central statio. It's both a good thing and a bad one because while it's close enough, no cabs really wanna take you so we ended up walking with the luggage.  What I didn't like about the hotel was that every room is of a different decor and size. We had no view and no place to open our bags and our lucky friends could do Yoga in their room. Of course, at the same tariff! It's quite a cozy place, if you keep expectations low, it's nice. Would suggest trying an IBIS instead. closer to station and not pretending to be more than what it really is!"
2009,"The 24 hour front desk staff was friendly and helpful. The room was comfortable and clean, and quiet. Very comfortable and inviting beautiful lobby. Best of all, the hotel treated us like we were family and always spent the time asking us about our day, or had suggestions to sights. Hotel de Londres Eiffel Paris had made our first visit to Paris a cherished and memorable stay. Merci beaucoup."
2010,"This is the perfect hotel for us we visiting Paris.  The reception folks are multi lingual, the rooms are clean and interesting, and we can't say enough about the location.  Lots of great restaurants nearby."
2011,"This is a average hotel, the rooms are good as is breakfast, the dining room is very cramped, dark and warm, lots of noise at night we had a fight between a couple in the next room one night which went on for two hours, also young backpackers being very noisy when coming in at night several times, its a backpackers hotel, the pool and sitting area on the roof is not well maintained, beer in the bar is flat, you are also right next to a very large derelict hotel which is not exactly scenic, no plugs in the bathroom basin even though i asked for it to be replaced"
2012,"Nevertheless it's an old hotel: it's not clean and there's a lack of maintenance and service! My room was dirty upon arrival. Even worse: during my stay housekeeping skipped my room for 2 days. The staff did not do a thing about it, most of them do not care (about anything)! One of the crew members literally said ""I was better of in an other hotel."" I think this hotel needs a new positive vibe and it all starts with the management. Wifi is also terrible. The good news: location is the best, lot's of bars, shops and restaurants in the neighborhood. I always used to stay -very satisfied- at a Morgans Hotel when I'm in the States or London... after my experience at Shore Club I'm not sure I will book again at MHG."
2013,"Stayed in the all-female dorm where there were dirty linens, cockroaches and ants. The electricity also goes on and off all night (which I guess can be good so you don't see the ants all over the dining room tables and your food at that)! You can't rent a towel, you can only buy one for the same price as a bus ticket to Hoi An. I was supposed to stay here two nights but decided to get out after one!   This is a lovely place for a drink, but you DO NOT have to stay here to party here! Find yourself a nicer hostel and just drop in to meet people/drink!   As for the staff, the western guy who appears to be in charge was very nice/helpful, but the rest of the staff both Vietnamese and Western were rude and acted as if I was an annoyance for asking questions about where to visit/eat!…"
2015,Got a cheap weekend with BA holidays and probably cheap because hotel is a bit further out.  Was a little concerned before we left but should not have been.  We payed for a taxi from Arlanda as we arrived late and this was a cost but all other journeys done on train so we did not mind.  Do not be put off that this hotel is out of the centre.  It is a 10 minute walk if that to the metro and then 20 minutes into town.  We spent Saturday in town coming back around 11pm.  Felt safe coming back although area was deserted.  On Sunday we checked out and then put luggage into the department store left luggage and off we went.  The Arlanda express was pricey coming back but convenient.  Despite the cost of transit the holiday was still cheap and I would recommend the hotel.  Breakfast…
2016,"Good hotel for couples and popular with seniors. Great location on the oceanfront and close to restaurants and a short level walk to the town centre. All areas spotlessly clean and very well maintained, including the garden areas. Buffet breakfast was ok. Didn't have an evening meal so can't comment on that. We did ask for room service one evening which isn't usually provided, but it was done without fuss which we greatly appreciate. Captain's Bar was nice - happy hour is always good! We had to ask for a drinks menu every time though. Same at the poolside bar - not enough menus, but the service there was very good and the staff friendly. Room was reasonable although a bit dated I feel. The beds weren't that comfortable. Nice straight-on view of the ocean from 2nd floor. The…"
2017,Had to Cancel a trip due to my Mother becoming extremely sick and dying !! Asked hotel for a refund Hotel said tuff luck !! Don’t want to stay at a hotel that is only interested in profit and not accommodating guest when they have an issue !!
2018,"I travel twice a year to Cannes, the hotel is clean, confortable the best bed and pillows! They serve you good breakfast! The hotel is like a boutique hotel all renovated! But most important part is the staff, all friendly and treat you like family! "
2019,"Pleasant reception with helpful staff. Good sized room, gown,slippers and toiletries. Good sized shower. Didn't use kitchenette apart from boiling a kettle. Convenient location. Great place to eat at Prince and breakfast at Type Hype both next door."
2020,"Fantastic atmosphere, comfortable and clean room. Nice and warm people, always there for you. Great beer as everywhere in Berlin :).    Quiet area not far away from city center. Real close u ban and taxi station."
2021,"I stayed at this hotel for a week, rooms are in need of an update and some rooms set up are less than great as the TV is installed on the living room area with no visibility from the bed. Daily cleaning is ok I did not feel like I was getting back to a fresh and clean room as I usually feel in other hotels, bed sheets were never changed throughout the 7 nights stay I made sure to put the towels on the floors so they be changed when needed. Front desk customer service lacks they only have 1 person at all times so there is a line often. Not sure if they speak English either as I speak Portuguese. Breakfast was good always replenished and with plenty of choices. Location is great close enough to Avenida Berrine but away from all the traffic craziness. Valet service was really great those guys had the best customer service skills in the hotel it was nice to just drop off the car and call for it when needed as it is almost impossible to find parking on the street. Parking costs R$20.00 a day also not noted anywhere found out when I got there but well worth it and I believe reasonably priced to according to the area.…"
2022,"Staff 5 Star plus. Accommodation 3.5 Star best. Food at breakfast 3 star Food at dinner awful ... 2 star.  No wonder dining room empty at night.  Staff extremely helpful and polite. Despite paying 5 Star prices, I shall be having evening meal out. Sorry. Just lack of choice and poorly prepared. Obviously on a budget."
2023,"Everyone at reception, bar area, room service and Gabrielle who gave me a wonderful massage are the biggest asset of this hotel!   I will keep this short as possible -:  Bathroom flooded when the plug was pulled from the bath tub, hair and dark matter covered the bathroom floor, it smelt bad! I nearly slipped getting out of the tub on the wet floor, no wall or hand rail to hold onto when getting in and out of tub. This should be a basic in all hotels where H&S is concerned. It took one hour for technician and house keeping to come and resolve the issue. Sadly very poor clean up, the floor wasn’t disinfected after drain matter was all over the floor. I asked the cleaner to spray the floor but they didn’t understand and sprayed air freshener. When trying to report the matter that…"
2024,The Pastana Grand is not 5 star . The rooms are spacious but 4 star standard and the food spoilt out Holiday ! No doubt the manager at the bottom of this review will comment but I complained 3 times in the week about the food ! Frozen Calamari in a 5 star ! Frozen potato croquettes as the only potatoes a few times in the week ! Frozen mixed vegetables! Same puddings . We are beside the sea ! No need for Frozen calamari ! Wish we had opted for B and B . On a positive note ! The staff were lovely and the place very clean and wonderful gardens !  
2025,"The room was in a new wing a very long walk from the reception and very comfortable. On the first day my room key failed to work so I had to traipse back to reception to get it reprogrammed.  On the second day the door handle broke and I reported it but it was not repaired during my stay.  The breakfast was reasonable.  Best thing about this hotel is its location, a few hundred metres from the Central Station.  I would rate it no higher than 3.5*.  The wifi was very good - 70Mbps download and 60Mbps upload."
2026,"Loved that this place was new and accommodations were very comfortable!  Great location, too, as there is a train station a block away.  The had a really nice breakfast selection and the staff was helpful."
2027,"We stayed at the President Hotel on January 5 for the national Championship game in Miami. We loved the location bc we could walk where we needed to go. The rooms were small but that was ok for us mainly bc it was clean. When we checked out the thrid party valet company Associated Parking Systems took about 45 minutes to bring our car around (longer then anyone else that waited). When it finally got there, the guy gave us the keys. When I went to walk around the back I noticed the back side of my car had been backed into. The valet guy NEVER mentioned this and when confronted his response was "" it wasn't like that?"" We filed a claim, he gave us a folded up piece of paper with Shawn Remmer claim managers name in sharpie, no business cards, nothing. It is now Feb 19 and he has yet…"
2028,"Checked in here for 3 nights and only stayed for 1. The place seemed dirty and smelly and totally unclean. Room ac, some lights and safe didn't work. Only stayed as we were so tired after missing a nights sleep. Woken up at 2am by guests in next room as the walls are that thin. I felt as though they were in our room with us. "
2029,Stayed at this nice hotel 3 night’s with wife and some friends. Very friendly staff. Clean rooms. Nice and cosy bar for coffe and drinks. The location is very good for shopping and it is easy to go to other parts of the City. 
2031,Made to feel like a criminal upon check in.  NO working WIFI available anywhere in the hotel. Requested room with a bathtub - given 3 rooms before I finally found one....had to go back each time to reception desk for new keys. Two hour check in process in total.  Parking garage will not allow motorcycles - was told by phone and at check in they were.  Parked in a garage 7 blocks away and then dragged luggage back to hotel.  Next morning took a cab to the parking garage from hotel. ZERO Management presence! Hotel address might be on N. Michigan Ave but this level of property is not up to par in any way to its location.  Avoid at all costs!!!!!!!
2033,"we have just returned from a lovely week in Funchal, the weather and food was amazing but the only downside was the hotel, yes it is a basic no frills hotel with a lovely pool area but many of the rooms are well past there best. however they are in the process of updating the rooms on the lower floors but sadly this led to a cacophony of Tile cutting, drilling, hammering stating at 8 o'clock every morning. we were on the 11th floor so it didn't wake us up but it was very unpleasant lay around the pool on the 4th floor. Breakfasts are continental but they do make eggs and omelettes (which are lovely) to order."
2034,"Spent two nights in this hotel during our work trip. Needed a lot of help, and the superfriendly clerk (Alexander, I recall) helped us in thousand ways. Would recommend any time! Nice, clean rooms and helpful staff. Two thumbs up!"
2035,An opportunity not to be missed. Opt for a canal view room and you won't regret it. Very close to city centre via metro but in the mean time you're quite close to the local community. Fantastic breakfast with a good choice and a very helpful staff. Will definitely return on my next visit to Paris.
2036,"Great location but thats where the good ends! The room we had was like a very neglected , dirty dorm room. A broken plywood frame around the ""bed"" which was a couple of foam squabs double stacked on the floor. The AC unit sounded like a Boeing jet engine and was held together by duct tape. A filthy filter from something was left on the kitchen bench. The worst part of our visit was the obnoxious jerk who checked us in. Yelled at my wife because he couldnt understand her , lucky we were in the USA otherwise he may have needed some dental work........"
2037,"There was hair all over the bed in our room and they moved us to a different room upon complain. The second room’s bed was ok, but bathrooms are horribly designed. They are tight and there is a towel rack above the toilet. There is barely any counter space so I used the rack to put my cardigan there, which sadly fell in the toilet beneath it. The hotel is way too overpriced for what it offers. Breakfast was included but they provide tiny dessert plates (some days, not all) for food. You’ll end up with 5 plates if you don’t bring your own disposable plates. The location is just OK. I would not stay here again."
2038,"Decent hotel located on the outer edge of Amsterdam.  It's about a 40minute walk from Amsterdam Centraal station, however this will feel much longer as the road lay out and map reading means you don't always take the quickest route.   We stayed in a standard room. Decent enough. Bed is comfortable and clean sheets, the floor however was pretty dirty and dusty, makeup was on the curtains, and someone stole the TV remote (not that we have come to watch TV) you get most mod cons Inc: WiFi which is allocated to a device,  kettle, fridge etc..   Oh you have to pay a tourist/ city tax on accommodation in Amsterdam which works out about 5%of your room cost, you have to pay this on check in.    Word of caution i was located on the ground floor and woke up to a lovely gentleman ummm…"
2039,"Had a great 3 nights stay here. Everything you would expect from a 4 star hotel. Clean, spacious, modern rooms and facilities, comfortable, really helpful staff (allowed us an early check in) and it feels safe (also has a safe in the room). Only downside is that the hotel is a fair distance from the centre of Berlin. It's not hours away but it's not conveniently placed. For the savings you make when booking here though, it's worth it."
2040,"Stayed in this sensibly priced hotel for 4 nights. Hotel is close to metro and tram links as well as new Glories shopping mall and entertainment centre. Also only a short walk to the Poble Nou district with numerous bars and restaurants.As for the hotel it was typically clean and modern and the staff were excellent, always very friendly and efficient. The only thing preventing a 5 star rating is that the breakfast (perhaps unsurprisingly) was continental style and on a couple of mornings we would have liked a cooked breakfast."
2042,"A very nice and well equipped and furnished suite with a huge sitting room and luxurious bathroom.  but the bedroom was a bit dark, facing an alley. The confort and the cleanliness of the room were flawless and all the staff gave an excellent service."
2043,"We arrived at around midnight at the hotel. It was very hard to tell where the hotel entrance was as it was obstructed by a massive queue of very cool looking people waiting for he rooftop bar. The reception staff were very pleasant. The first night we were put on the 8th floor. Sadly as soon as we entered the room we could hear the thumping music coming from the bar on the 10th floor. we asked to move rooms and they were happy to do so, but they couldn't until the following day so we slept with earphones in so we couldn't hear the bass coming through the walls. The bar finally closed at 2am. I can only imagine what it must be like for people on the 10th floor! It was a very friendly atmosphere and after we had moved rooms it was a brilliant stay. Although by moving rooms we…"
2045,"This hotel is located on a side street of quite a busy shopping region. It is hard to imagine a better location: 5 min walking to the bus stop to/from TXL airport; and two different metro lines, which will connect you in not time to any place in downtown. But still the street is very peaceful and silent. Breakfast is premium for this category of hotels.  Comfortable beds! With respect to cleanness, well, it is clean but not crystal clean. There are these little details like somewhat rusted sink drains, or small corners full of dust here and there. These details could be improved. But overall had great stay there for 3 days."
2046,"We arrived here in the evening of the 3/9/2013 to be greeted by the bellboy Yannis at the top of the stairs leading down to the hotel, he welcomed us and proceeded to take our cases from us and negotiate the stairs....no mean feat carrying two suitcases, and would not let me help him, the guys a star.  Now back to the stairs (which the hotel in fairness to them told us they were the responsibility of the local council), They are a nightmare, no two steps are the same height or width some sloping forward, some sloping sideways, no handrail and at some points the lighting was not at its best, also on the edge of each step there was no white line painted, a nightmare if your visually impaired. So if the stairs are the responsibility of the local council, if I were Mr Mystique I…"
2048,"I stayed here for 4 nights in room no 15 with balcony. The staff were very helpful. The location was just 1 station away from Zoologischer garten station. If you had a big luggage , please keep in mind  that you had to carry them to 1 floor on the stair with 18 steps. I think the room was not function properly such as in the wet area in the bathroom should have slide door and the furniture was not appropriate . But we were happy during staying here ."
2049,"After prepaying for a three night stay at this hotel, I arrived after a long day of traveling and was told that they had given my room to someone else.  They gave me $10 for a cab ride to another property owned by the same group.  The second hotel was a cheaper hotel than this and I was not refunded nor did I recieve any kind of room upgrade to compensate for the inconvenience.  Additionally, I emailed the hotel group twice and responded to their survey and still have heard nothing back.  I strongly recommend that you dont prepay for this hotel.  Personally, this group (joie de vivre hotels) has lost me as a customer forever.  Be forewarned."
2050,"Stayed in the hotel on multi occasions recently. Very conveniently located on the main street, but a bit far from the walking street and old town. Since it is an old building, rooms have quite many different layouts. Some are quite spacious, some are quite cramp, barely enough to move. Refreshing water is provided during check-in.  The hotel provides a small bottle of perfume for guests to sprinkle on their bedding before going to bed. Other amenities are well stocked. Still water is provided every night to the room. I visited the rooftop pool side bar, which is quite windy at times, but have a great panoramic view of the city.  Breakfast is top notch. Very nice interior. The garden terrace is even better. Though limited choice of hot dishes, other dishes complement the…"
2051,"Thank you for the friendly welcome. A nice, clean hotel with a good location. Very helpful staff who were always ready to help. This is a perfect hotel to spend a weekend as a couple. We hope to come back very soon."
2052,"Stayed at the Castro Villa. For the price, I would’ve stayed somewhere else though. Jacuzzi is not really appealing. Appliances in kitchen are dated and having breakfast made in the room for you is an awkward system even though staff was great. I just don’t like them coming in.   Would be better if they just deliver it made or leave the fridge full of ingredients you could cook on your own. Feels more like renting a cave vrbo instead of an actual hotel. It’s definitely a three star hotel by US standards, but the service is four and half star. Bathroom is dark and awkward.  Views are amazing though.  Good location and air conditioning worked really well. Staff was very nice. Just way overpriced for the quality of the sheets, towels and decoration finishes in the room. I gave  a…"
2053,"We had a nice stay here and all of the communal areas were well kept and clean, the lobby seemed very modern but this didn't translate into our room. Which was dated and worn. The room looked very tired. We did have a nice view and the bed was very comfy. Overall we had a pleasant stay but the rooms could do with a lot of TLC and updating, wouldn't say it was the end of the world though as we didn't spend too much time inside. But the cleanliness of some of the areas in the room could so with being looked at, such as the window seperating the shower and bathroom didn't look like it had been cleaned for a while. The buffet breakfast had a lot of choice and we enjoyed that each morning. Beautiful views from the pool side which we enjoyed a few days relaxing there and soaking up…"
2054,"I had an enjoyable stay in this hotel ( even though there was reconstruction going on ) the staff were very helpful, especially a young receptionist called Manuella. She went above and beyond her duties when I was there, helping me find a chemist which was open over the Easter holidays and cash machines and just generally being very pleasant and helpful, thank you Manuella. Best Western, you have a wee gem there, look after her 😁"
2055,"Added FACILITY FEE +$34.00  for amenities ????   A con to charge you more for the room.   Checking on the website gives a list of ""amenities""  - Discount rate at Equinox..  - $27 versus $35 - A bottle of water in the room...!!  - ""Guided runs"" ??  whatever that means (you ask for a map?)   Various other useless sundries in an attempt to justify.  This should not be allowed."
2056,"A great hotel w one of the best breakfast buffets we’ve seen! Though the pool area was usually overrun w kids or angry tourists. Get there early to grab seats. The staff there was very friendly and accommodating. The hotel was very clean and stylish. A great location, as well. We’d def go back! "
2057,"A really fantastic location with lovely staff. The only issue for us was the bedding, a double was two singles pushed together with a gap in between and the pillows very flat. Despite this, I would still definitely stay again for the wonderful location & staff friendliness and efficiency."
2058,the location its very good staff very friendly  beds are comfortable very clean  needs bit renovation !! no Loby breakfast its okay maybe some cooked eggs would be good !!! the staff at breakfast were very friendly
2059,"The hotel is more concerned about being a destination bar and restaurant rather than providing for the guests. The only hotel communal areas are the bar restaurant or people trying to find the restaurant/bar. Not convenient when you're looking for somewhere to sit given your tiny room has 1 chair; no natural light/air (window painted shut) and not enough room for 1 suitcase, let alone 2. So much money to pay for this experience.  Oh yes, and you'll get the sound of the music from the rooftop bar till 1-2am. Though don't expect to attend said bar as there's a queue to get in. A busy, hectic place which is not relaxing or comfortable in any way."
2060,"So the place look totally new, feels home and cosy. But there is one thing thank makes place unique, the Reception guys. A guy named Eddie was taking care of every thing we needed, was always smiling and patient to all of our needs.every recommendation that he gave us was just superb! employees like this are giving you the feeling that the hotel will surround you with a comfort net, and that is exactly what I expect from an hotel when I am in a new city"
2061,"We only stayed 3 nights and eventually moved to the Everest Rio Hotel. The room was just too small for a couple. The air conditioner was a split-type but the compressor was on the wall right next to the bed so it woke me up every time the compressor kicked in. The hotel does have a nice, private roof deck bar which is usually empty so a nice spot for an evening drink although the cocktails are expensive. Breakfast in the attached restaurant was OK."
2062,"Scoonds away from the iconic Croisette with its own private beach, this hotel was a lovely place to spend the week of my 60th Birthday. When they found out about our celebration, they left me a bottle of wine in the room as a gift.    The cocktails in the bar were expertly mixed, and they had live piano music every night.  On the beach we enjoyed their snack menu with drinks.    Room service was quick and excellent, and our special request for a champagne breakfast was delivered exactly when we asked.  A great hotel.."
2063,We stayed for one night during a Vietnam tour.  The room was neither beautiful nor nice but quite clean. The hot water in our room did not work. The wifi also did not work. The karaoke bar around the corner was so loud it felt like being within the hotel.  Breakfast was ok.  Definitely a one-time experience for me.
2065,"I come to Rio several times a year for business, and have generally stayed down the road from here, and was excited to see this was now an Accor/Mercure hotel. Stepping into the room was immediately disappointing - do NOT be fooled by the room picture shown on the website, as the room looks nothing like this. No balcony, which would have been nice. But that's minor, compared to the other disappointments.  After three replacement doors, my room safe never worked. I told the desk about an infestation of ants in the desk area, and maintenance came to the room and simply brushed them onto the floor...I COULD HAVE DONE THAT MYSELF. And of course they returned to the desk within the hour.  Exiting the room to go back downstairs, and the carpets in the hallway smell like a thousand wet…"
2066,I am extremely disappointed with my stay in Park Shore Waikiki and I will not come back to this hotel. I would rather pay a bit of premium with big hotel chains like SPG and Marriott because you get better facilities and service from well-trained staff.  I found this hotel online (booking.com and hotels.com) but made direct reservations in the hotel website although the price is $10 higher as reviewers commented you get a better chance of upgrade if you check-in directly with the hotel. The only reason I chose this hotel is because of its location (closer to quieter beach and the diamond head) and they claim that rooms are newly renovated.    I first booked a one night stay and booked two rooms (one for me and another one for my friend who is a resident of Hawaii and I'm…
2067,"The hotel has a good location in front of the river Douro but the room has view to the backyard 🙁. Room with good space, good bed but water coming out from the shower (design issue) 😕. Breakfast good. Lunch an dinner menu not attractive.  There was a smell to food in the room aisles Now the real problem: In the street in the main entrance of the hotel there is no parking space. The hotel garage of the hotel is very small with terrible access. I mean really terrible, there is a ramp with a significant angle and the exit has a very tight curve that is very difficult to avoid to scratch your car. I did scratch mine and was not the first as there were several marks on the wall and on the pipping, even the foam on that one was damaged. My frustration is that an alert on the wall or…"
2068,"Terrible experience, considering the price. I just spend there 3 nights. I paid 900 $ for 3 nights and another 500 $ for food and beverage. The resort is surrounded on all 3 sides by construction sites: cranes, concrete, workers, piling machines , noise etc. I got probably the best bungalow with private pool...and plenty of 5 star mold on the walls...a family place. Some of staff tries to save the situation but is not enough. On Saturday evening the resort was shared with some company team building activity...noise and few hundreds people around the tourists - zero supervisor or so. Never , ever again at this Novotel . Picture available. 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎"
2069,"Definitely a very nice hotel. I really appreciated the Christmas Day policy to only serve residential guests in the lounge/lobby as it’s my understanding that it can get very busy normally. I found the staff extremely polite and helpful. In fact I would say the staff is some of the best (as a whole) that I’ve experienced in the world.  The biggest mistake was booking us into the wrong room category, despite having made the reservation about 5 months in advance, they put us into a junior suite, rather than an executive suite. By the time we had lunch, got up to the room and saw that it was all wrong, all of the good suites had gone and we ended up with the only one they had left- definitely the worst. Weirdly designed so that the bathroom wasn’t actually en-suite and we had to…"
2070,"We recently enjoyed a 5 day trip to Cannes and this hotel was absolutely wonderful. To start with it is a beautiful hotel with a very welcoming driveway, a lovely bright spacious foyer and a gorgeous swimming pool, with sunbeds and luxurious lounging area. I have to say we came to Cannes for the beaches but my son literally fell in love with the swimming pool and spent many happy hours every day in it.  Our room was on the first floor of the hotel and had a pretty view of the garden and pool with a fabulous seating area and lounge bed on the balcony. The room was kept immaculately clean with slippers, dressing gowns and fresh supplies of toiletries and towels every day. The beds were soft and the fridge an absolute godsend for keeping bottles of water cold.  As well as being…"
2071,"Very nice appartment having everything needed including a nice view from the 6th floor. The area is not the best, on the other hand it was very close to everything including metro stations. The personel were all very helpfull which we really appreciated. No doubt we will choose Feel at Home next we will have a trip to Barcelona :-)"
2072,The WEINMEISTER Is what i was loking when i was to Berlin for work.Nice room (for the money we spent) and friendly-smiling staff. I recommend it to all of you without second thoughts.I will visit again in my next trip at Berlin
2073,"Reserved a room in this ""luxury"" hotel for our anniversary and the experience was very disappointing.  There was BLACK mold creeping all around the tub and up the white tiles of the shower.  Paid over $300 for this experience (room was supposedly worth over $500). We spoke to the manager, Charlie, early in the morning as we checked out.  He offered breakfast, but honestly, when a hotel room is that dirty, who wants to eat there?  We said we were ready to leave and he said he would call us after he checked the room and he would try to make some effort to make things right.  Wish he had called; we would have been more impressed with the service if he had."
2074,Very crisp on design. Simple and relaxing. Good location by the bus stop in the shopping area. Very nice staff and welling to help and give directions in details.  Was there fir two days business and can't fault it
2075,"Room: Booked a small double and yes, so small I could only open my luggage at one corner, which unfortunately was infront of the closet with the fridge which door kept falling of the fridge..Had a top floor room very charming and very comfy big bed. Bathroom small but had what you needed and very nice toiletries. Breakfast was a VERY good breakfast, fantastic and tasty pancakes, fried eggs with veggies and fresh fruit. Location: perfect but so noisy from traffic, tram and the constuction from the harbour."
2076,"We spent 4 nights at the Heckers Hotel between 31 May & 4 June 2016.  We stayed in a 'comfort room' on the first floor.  The room was large with a walk in wardrobe area with safe and fridge, a large bedroom area with plenty of space and a modern bathroom. Breakfast was high standard continental and substantial to start you off for a days exploring.  The hotel is located close to the Zoologischer Garten train station and the Savignyplatz U bahn station and just off the Kurfurstendamm shopping street where you can pick up a city bus tour or visit the many shops. You can get the airport express from Berlin Schonefeld direct to the Zoologischer Garten for €3.30.  You can return on the S Bahn from the Zoo via Ostkreuz for the same price.  Although the Cassambalis restaurant adjoins…"
2078,"Impeccable service, perfect location - 2 mins from the Metro station, 15 minutes to the Bogatell Beach, 10 minutes to Ciutadella Park with it's Zoo etc. Rooms small and ascetic however sparkling clean. The small but cosy roof pool with the pool bar was the cherry on top of the cake. Breakfast rather modest and the same every day, no toothbrush / toothpaste / shampoo etc. in the bathroom - but again, this is two stars property! The price was higher then I think it should be, but I booked not long before the trip and it was the high season, so again should not complain. All in all, highly recommended. Just book in advance :)"
2081,"I've stayed here before and recommended it but standards have slipped. For the prices they are now charging, I expect better. Terrible mattresses - sagging on one side. I asked to move after second night and would have asked again but was only staying two nights. If a mattress is so worn it has deep indentations, don't act surprised when I report it.  Forgot my adaptor and was surprised when they didn't have any and suggested I go buy one. Most hotels have built in USB ports or at least courtesy adaptors. This one doesn't!  Losing faith in HI Express as I expected better. "
2083,"We were a couple and had a twin room. As we were travelling for 5 weeks, we had a bit of luggage. The room is uncomfortably small and whoever designed the wardrobe and storage space had no idea what is needed. We had to use the floor and tops of our suitcases to stack our clothes. And we were in one of the updated rooms. We mentioned all this on check out and the staff were aware of these issues. The hotel, staff and food are excellent. Maybe we should have chosen a non standard room."
2084,"It is one of the classic luxury hotel and also one of the oldest in Berlin. All the design, furniture's, and elevator has a classic touch. The service is luxurious and I really like the pool, gym, and sauna. The breakfast is delicious and they offer various of food and could accommodate people who has dietary restrictions (vegan, halal, kosher, etc). The lobby bar is amazing and I invite some of my coworkers and they love it. The location is 2 thumbs up which is near the Brandenburg gate and Berlin Mall.  A little downturn is in my bed, instead of they giving queen bed they put together 2 single bed which is not really comfortable. The wire below the working table is quite a mess and during breakfast, I ask for fresh juice and it take quite sometime (but the juice is fresh and…"
2085,"We stayed here on two separate occasions at the start and end of a trip.  The hotel is quite plain but the rooms are spotlessly clean and beds are comfortable. Buffet breakfast is quite adequate and is replenished frequently.  It's further out of the centre than you'd want in this hilly city and we decided on a taxi back after our day's sightseeing; they are cheap enough - only 5€ from the Ribeira.  We booked a twin room rather than a double because they are larger and also asked for a non smoking room; at the start of the trip it was fine but on our second visit neither request was met.  The double room was so small that we had to store a suitcase in the bathroom, so we went to reception to ask to change rooms.  We were given a speech about special requests being subject to…"
2086,"This is a lovely hotel in the mountains, excellent value and good food. The only thing that let it down was a strong smell of sewage in our room, which was the 2 bedroom apartment. We pointed it out when we arrived, though there was no follow up so we pointed it out again in the evening (to a different member of staff). In the end, we were moved to two standard rooms which were fine, though not what we had planned as we wanted to spend the evening with our friends with some privacy.  The staff did their best to make it up, offering us a drink each and 25% discount on dinner.  Problems can obviously occur with any property, though this should have been sorted out sooner and the fact that staff didn't notice it and do something about it before our arrival is very poor as the smell…"
2087,"5星級價錢但服務非常不及格！2/23ㄧ早排隊等辦退房，前台2位服務員都沒注意到有人在排隊嗎？等了一陣子只好提醒其中一位服務員(名叫Charlotte)，沒想到她竟然態度很差地先回說""我還沒辦完退房""然後才撥電話請其他人出來幫忙; 我當然知道她還在為前一位客人退房，但就是等了很久才需要請她找其他人出來幫忙！態度差又不會注意現場狀況，真不知道教育訓練是怎麼做的！ 另外早餐非常普通，以後不會再住這家飯店了！ The price is 5 star but the service and the food are not. The front desk, Charlotte, had bad attitude when I requested a help for checkout on Feb 23. Pls enhance the training for the action to long queues.  Besides, the breakfast is not so good. Won't stay this hotel next time. "
2088,"Pleasant staff, helpful information at reception and decent restaurant for pizza, pasta etc next door. Also a Spar Mini/Market by entrance.  But the noise negates all the good points.  Odd numbered rooms overlook the railway line and I mean overlook probably abour 30m away from my room on 2nd floor.  Trains run regularly from about 04:30 and there are literally hundreds of them a day as also a main interconnection for tram, train and bus.    Get a room on a high floor and make sure you get an even numbered room."
2089,"I went to Peninsula with two of my friends for lunch. The staff was very friendly ,the place was very quite and clean. We ordered to many things from their menu but the food that i enjoyd very much was the first one bread with some butter and white cheese. The waiter was very friendly i asked him where they buy this bread and he writer me the adress of the bakery .I recommend it  "
2090,"My room was spotlessly clean and modern with all the details included, such as hair dryer, tea/coffee facilities, etc. The breakfast was excellent. Also a five minute walk from Sagrada Famila, and to the nearest metro station."
2092,"As this was our first time going to Barcelona, and my first time staying in a 'Hostel' I wasnt really sure what to expect. Upon arriving at the Hostel Wander I did for a second wonder what I had done, the entrance hallway could definitely do with some Love and I wish that somehow we had be told or read a review about the entrance so we knew what to expect. However, the hostel itself is located on the 7th floor, its really lovely inside, a little boutique hostel, very modern, clean, tidy and new. The Lady on reception was very welcoming and helpful. The rooms were spacious, your own shower and toilet - a hairdryer too. Its super clean, our rooms and towels were cleaned every day. The Location is absolutely PERFECT, you couldnt ask to be more central, everything you need is on your doorstep. Im not usually one to leave a review, but i would definitely recommend this hostal to anyone going to explore Barcelona!! I wouldnt recommend taking heels ladies, your feet will ache and its not worth it, the best form of transport is walking! Thank you Hostal Wander for your hospitality, we hope to visit Barcelona again soon.…"
2094,Booked this hotel 48hr in advance 4 adults one room 2 double beds. Upon arrival I was told that all they had was a room with a king size bed. Management suggested someone sleep on the floor. They were very busy. They made no offer to help find another location. This was on a Saturday evening. My family and I travel quite a bit but I have never been ask to sleep on the floor.The front desk personnel appeared to be the iconic Deer caught in the headlights..We left and went to a nearby Sheration they also were full but found us a room not far from Ohare .They went out of their way to help us and now have earned  themselves a new customer. Has Marriott decided selling floor space is the way to go? If so is rude the new chic.
2095,"The apartment is Entenca 140 located in quite central area but hasn't got a lot of atmosphere...The building is old and full of character and once the works of renovation finish in the entrance and stairs and a lift is added it will be very nice all round. At the moment there is a big contradiction between the inside of the apartments and the first impression at the entrance. The apartments are great value, nice colour tasteful scheme and very nice bedding mattress however the rooms  are very cold as the doors and windows are old style and do not insulate at all the cold  and Barcelona is cold in the winter same with bathroom as there is only a heater in the living area. NO LIFT... now that is something you should think carefuly about before booking as it is a big CON when you…"
2096,"First off we booked a bargain room on Booking.com. The price was moderate for our needs. Then we informed the hotel that we were in need of a room for people with disabilities. We were then upgraded to a deluxe suite, as that is the only suite available befitting our needs. Nothing that is too expensive, only an extra 20 Euros a night. Also no need of a lift because this suite is on the Ground floor. Excellent so far. So were set for accommodation when we arrived in Paris.  I drove my little turquoise Agila from London, via the A roads rather than the expressways. It took a little longer, it was a bright and sunny day, so we enjoyed the weather and the relaxedness of the journey. we stopped for coffee at Calais upon arrival, after the short trip through the EuroTunnel on the train. Then we got underway properly, arriving in Paris in the late afternoon.  Through a gateway, along a small winding path through an almost jungle-like garden, found us at the reception of the Hotel Max. We were greeted pleasantly and politely. Shown our room and left to our own devices.  When we had an enquiry, the staff, Bessah and Moussa, answered our questions or took care of the situation without fuss or bother. We felt that we were made not only welcome, but that we were treated almost as one of their family.  We had no major problems, the door to our suite was a bit on the heavy side and I didn't realise that, so we asked for help with that, the first time.  Being on the Ground floor, our suite was one wall thickness from the sidewalk. That wasn't a problem as there were thick curtains which blocked the lights and sounds from the thoroughfare.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Max. I took my Fureya there for her birthday, and besides the elation of spending her birthday in Paris, Fureya was blown away by how thoughtful the hotel had been in providing for her disability. The seat in shower room was very well received. Staying in that suite we felt enabled, and it set a wonderful tone for our visit to France's capitol city.  Thanks, guys.…"
2097,"The appalling experience my family and I had at the Casasur Bellini started at day one when, after hours of travel from we were ""welcomed"" by the polite less employee at the front desk which my wife, my one year old daughter and I finally reached - with all our luggage without any help from their staff. The room is spacious and clean (except for the visible used glasses). On day two I ask the front desk lady some help with information regarding a car we needed to rent. (Christmas was near and I knew I needed to make a reservation in advance. So I did). She told me that I could do that myself, literally. She even wanted to give me some telephone numbers so I could call). I told her that I would really appreciate some help since I was and vacations and that as a hotel client I…"
2098,I would like to suggest no for this hotel if u looking luxuries stay..!!  Staff at restaurant are too lazy to work..!! And staff at the help desk were very annoying specially the guy with specs(dnt rembr his name).. Over all it was ok ok stay..  Housekeeping staff were the only one with good service and helpful..!!  Speacial thanks to rajesh was so kind and helpful with his service..!!
2099,"I stayed at junior suite.  No club reception. No private check-in. No shuttle service. No concierge. No explanation for room facility, exit-route, and complimentary services.    I brought my buggages by myself! In the fantastic pool, there're white scums floating.    No clear water. And untidy. ""Good"" was Club lounge food, especially Mango tart. At first, my credit-card (Diners) wasn't accepted, although reserved the room w/ it, and no issue at Peninshula. Actually, I was told to draw the cash at ATM with it! No hospitality, but a little hostile. I think that my low rating for this hotel is quite fair."
2101,Very tiny - I guess 15 m2?! and dark. No view or rather view on the huge noisy garbage. They emptied it at 22:30!!! Noise of broken glasses for 10 min! Small window! No coffee machine. U can’t make tea or coffee or hot water simply. One draw for your clothes.  So little space. No slippers provided.  I regret to be here :( Waiting for tomorrow morning to get out of here - from this claustrophobic room! The only plus being good location   
2102,Room was quite nice.pool service ridiculous 35mins for drink.had ice cream with no spoon I was told it was on its way it never arrived so I never got my ice cream as it melted😥.no facilities to get your own drinks or snacks so extremely slow service.
2103,"A bland, international hotel that has everything you need for a few days' stay, but no atmosphere or local character. It's within walking distance of the Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh museum and Stedelijk, so perfect if your plan is simply to visit them. If you go to see Amsterdam itself, and especially the old city, you'd do better to stay somewhere more central, and perhaps with more character."
2105,"I booked here last minute as I had a business meeting in Lisbon. I was disappointed that there is more than one Holiday Inn in Lisbon and I had booked the one ithout the roof terrace which featured in the photos...maybe my oversight. On arriving in the room the Wifi was not easy to connect to and when connected was pretty slow and the TV was fuzzy and only had sky news and BBC news as the two English speaking channels. The engineer came up to try to fix the TV, he didn't speak English and left it very slightly less fuzzy than he had started. The bathroom a little tired although I will say the water pressure fantastic in the shower. All in all average....would I stay there again....probably not"
2106,"Having read reviews and paying budget prices I was with a little trepidation I approached this hotel.  I need not have been concerned.  The hotel is very well located for access to the old town, marina and restaurants.  The rooms are clean.  I didn't have a wonderful view but I know from some rooms you can see the ocean.  Should you wish to cook there is a kitchenette and fridge.  Only one pillow.  I would recommend requesting a second one post haste on arrival.  The pillow was supplied very quickly.  Continental breakfast was included.  The bread rolls (fresh every morning) are delicious.  However as with most continental breakfasts the lack of choice did get to me.  However easily rectified as next door there is a Spar shop where you can add to your breakfast items.  It was…"
2107,"Great if you like your napkin folded like a fan and traditional table linen.  Food variable, but generally there was always something edible......that is if you do not mind flies.  The hot food was covered, but the buffet totally uncovered.  Cheese tended to be covered in flies, so it was wise to select a slice from the middle!  Could not fault the location, which is very picturesque, with efficient local buses to Funchal or taxis, the cost of which vary from 18 to 35 Euros.  Oh.and forgot to mention there are not enough sun beds around the pool and very few shady places."
2108,When I first arrived there were 3 people in front of me to check in via the HHONORS line. Seemed like the staff did not care about the queue of people waiting and were happy to assist whoever jumped in front of them. At least 3 people just waltzed up to the counter totally ignoring the line to be checked in. The wait was unreasonably long for the small queue as a result. The staff took no action.   I made my reservation using points. When I made them I was scared that the room type or rate would sell out so I made the reservations as I was able. I had two separate reservations. Before my trip (4 days) I called the helpdesk and asked that they be linked. The person I spoke with assured me that a note was placed on my reservations. When I checked in I asked that they confirm that…
2109,"We loved Da Nang. The Finger hotel seemed nice. The sky bar and pool is definitely lovely! The rooms are well priced with modern bathrooms and comfy beds (actually the best we've had all trip). But we found the staff weren't as hospitable as other places we've stayed. And to top it off, when we checked out, one of the concierge staff organised our taxi for us to the airport. Except, the driver started taking us back to Hoi An instead of to the airport - the complete opposite direction. By the time we realised, our fare was massive and the driver played dumb so we had to pay it. It left a sour taste in our mouths. "
2110,"Lovely hotel, well positioned about 10 mins walk from the sea front. The rooms were clean, comfortable and well equipped (safe, fridge, kettle, free WiFi etc.). As can be expected in Cannes, the prices for drinks were high (10 Euros for a small beer) so we didn't drink there much. The buffet breakfast was fine. We didn't use the spa or swimming pool. If the pool had been an outdoor pool we probably would have used it. Only problem we had was our room keys that seemed to need programming every day. i felt a bit frustrated when i was told that our cards were for another room and that we both must have picked up someone elses room key, even though it had worked (albeit briefly) earlier that day."
2111,"Just the place you need for a City Stay. Great location for shopping (around the corner from KaDeWe and U-Bahn), lovely breakfast buffet, free WiFi, convenient underground parking for a reasonable fee, friendly staff, clean and comfy rooms, modern design with cool colours and details and unbeatable value for money. My absolute favourite hotel in Berlin!"
2112,Reception was efficient and helpful.We had a large group and room keys were given very quickly. Rooms were spacious.Breakfast was excellent. Not far from bus and metro route into the city.Good value for money. Good restaurants close by.
2113,"The hotel requires a good renovation, painting and replacement of furniture. Walls and furniture are a bit grimy. The breakfast is very poor for those who need special diets, such as diabetics. Does not do justice to the name Radisson."
2114,"Don't stay here. Their valet service broke our car, making it unsafe to drive. The hotel manager was unable to contact the valet service manager to help us resolve the issue. They are unwilling to comp any part of the stay to reimburse repair costs to the car and we are left without a way to leave the city and go back home."
2115,Property was good but we are not happy with house keeping service. Infact reception service was not good according to 5 star hotel. Extremely laid back attitude. We will not plan our holiday here again. 
2116,"This property is very beautiful its in a good location to where all the attractions right across from the beach .From viewing this hotel online it seems like the perfect location , However the customer service is terrible ! The front desk staff really doesn't know how to talk to people I ask *Amie , Amy* how to connect to the wifi she answered me so sarcastically I didn't even bothered to come to the front desk with other questions I had. My room was nice housekeeping did a really nice job when servicing my room the restaurant food was ok  however , I don't think I'll be coming back to this hotel ever   again ."
2117,"This hotel is absolutely precious. It's like something out of a Parisian dream. Everything is immaculate, and every single detail is just perfect. We stayed in room 39, which is the only room on the reception level, I believe. It was a superior triple room, with one double bed and one single bed. The bathroom was large, supplied with great big fluffy towels, bathrobes, and slippers. Nice hot water pressure, too! There was an adorable little courtyard just off the bedroom, complete with couches and a table. Plenty of room for luggage storage, even with a small bedroom. The staff was so kind and accommodating and was able to get us into our room early, even though we arrived at 11am. I wish I could have stayed longer than 1 night. I would absolutely stay here again! My only…"
2118,"Awesome skybar at the 11th floor. Good breakfast and nice beds. But the room decoretion was not ment for collegues to share, since there was no door between bath and bed areas, only a half wall. The mirrors to the toilette made it rather visible. Some rooms did how ever have a door to the bathrooms like normal hotels"
2119,"The hotel is located at the great location walking distance to many tourist attractions. The staff are friendly, however, one night it seems like the hotel staff are unavailable (they have a temporary employee) so he was not really sure how can he help me.... Overall, it was a really nice and great hotel, will definitely visit again. "
2120,Location was good some of staff were good but overall experience for the price was fairly poor there was plenty of apologies but nothing much done about it just poor excuses from maintenance i would not recommend to anyone 
2121,"This place is a 2 min walk from the train station which is great because the train is so efficient and you can get around all of Berlin quickly. The breakfast is 8 euros and it's decent but convenient especially if you want to start your day off early. Check in is at 3 pm and they are super strict about that and did not allow for early check in which was a bummer since I had travelled a long time and wanted to rest when I got there. The room is a double, its small but has enough space. Very modern place. They also have a bar in the breakfast area. They have a pizza vending machine- don't eat from there it's pretty awful lol. I had high hopes. If I ever come back to Berlin i think i would stay closer to the main parts of the city just so it would be more convenient but the price…"
2122,"I was exceptionally pleased with all aspects of this facility. It was on a side street, so the rooms were fairly quiet. The bathrooms were modern and the showers were great. The Jacuzzi was a pleasant surprise."
2123,"During our month in America, the worst hotel for our family.  High charges for parking and upgrades with then comment ""this is San Francisco"", but worst of all, we just noticed that they charged more than 1000€ 3 months after our staf whilst everything was paid!!!!  Do not go there, this is the Hilton name completely unworthy!"
2125,Asked front desk to print concert tickets. They said no. Business Center is on second floor. After two $6.78 internet connection fees along with two $.67 print fee it cost an additional $16 to see concert. Ignorant way to accommodate guests.        
2126,"had holiday formal tea at the Drake yesterday-we were extremely disappointed.  Uninspired food that clearly had been made earlier. Dry bread, tasteless scones,etc. Crowded area for the tea, rushed servers, uncomfortable banquet type chairs, noisy and brightly lit-all for a significant price. Atmosphere was everything at the Palm Court in years past but no more. 3 generations were in our party and all agreed that we'll never return. Now it seems clear the object is quick guest turnover and profits maximized. Nothing special about this experience. Unimpressive at best."
2127,"This is the second year I have stayed at this hotel. Everything is perfect, location, helpful and friendly staff, very spacious rooms, outstanding service. Highly recommend. Looking forward to returning next year."
2128,The hotel is in a very good location but the rooms are very small and diappointing. The hotel pictures and description made us think of a very special theme hotel but it turned out to be a very tinny hotel with vry small rooms. I DONT REALLY RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL BECAUSE FOR ITS PRICE YOU CAN GET A MUCH BETTER HOTEL.
2129,"The hotel is in walking distance to Checkpoint Charlie, the wall, Brandenburg Gate and metro stations; stayed in the apartment residence, very spacious and comfortable with kitchenette; great facilities onsite; it loses a star because you have to ask for the cutlery and kitchenware, plate/ cutlery set for 2 however we were in 3! I would gladly stay here again!"
2131,"Our family owns a change of choice hotel, so we are very lucky to receive friends and family discount, we mostly stay at choice hotels so when deciding to travel to California from Maryland for vacation we started our adventure in San Francisco. I booked our room approx 5 months before our trip and when we arrived we discovered that our hotel was is in a sketchy area of town called Tenderloin area. When we arrived at our hotel we were told that they had no parking and we had to find our own. My husband drove around for approximately 45 minutes till he found a garage about 5 blocks from hotel.which cost $45 a night.  These 5 blocks are covered with homeless tents and drug paraphernalia. One morning we walked to car where my (2)14 year olds were able to see how a homeless man…"
2132,"If you like ""black"" then this hotel is for you!  The decor is in a minimalist style that could be called ""Scandinavian Funeral Parlour"".  The bar and social areas are GLOOMY and not at all appealing.  We had a Junior Suite which had a faulty spa bath (found out when actually in it - so I spared the maintenance man the trauma of coming to fix it while I was up to my neck in bubbles!  Electric window blinds (interior and exterior) not correctly operative.  On the plus side: all staff were unfailing polite, the barman made a great Bloody Mary, the restaurant food was excellent (for dinner and wide-ranging breakfast buffet) and house-keeping cheerful/professional.  Hotel well located for airport and public transport.  Very much personal choice but, regretfully, would not stay here…"
2133,"Fantastic hotel, would recommend...staff very professional yet friendly and helpful at all times. Location great, walking distance to s lazare station, breakfast tasty. Must not forget the private steam room, great touch ! The rooms are decorated to a high standard a perfect romantic getaway. "
2134,"Right from check-in, this place felt unwelcome. The staff was very cold and felt like they wanted me out of the way. Bathroom sink had green mold. Checkout experience was terrible. Paid $400+ per night."
2136,"Stayed  here 3 nights, location is a bit hard to find the first time, then it is no problem. Staff is nice and helpful.  Room are small but you get a clean and safe place to sleep.  Water pressure is weak but again it's a hostel not a hotel.  Walking tour and pub crawl is organised for each day and list of things to do is posted daily."
2137,"The hotel has mixed values, looks and feels like a 3 star and not 4. Where the rooms were very comfy the elevators were very smelly. Location was ok as tram stop was there and main station round the corner. Food is expensive. For January and the way is advertised I would say that is was a bit expensive."
2138,"Came to Berlin for the weekend and loved our stay here! Very well priced, excellent staff and beautiful courtyard. Easy to interact and meet people not your typical hotel. The rooms are great and the bar downstairs is lush. Will have to come back and experience the summer here."
2139,"The best location in Cannes with its own private beach club.  I got a really big suite with a great view but the bathroom was really small.   Nice friendly service at the front desk, i got a free upgrade !   Beautiful beach club."
2141,"Rooms are extra small, Bed are stick between 3 walls ! We booked for 15$ and we discover it doesn't worth 8$ and many customers paid  only 7$. No fridge. There's a karaoke next to the hotel, don't expect to sleep quite. Renting an automatic motobike is 190000 dong, normally I just pay 100000 in any other cities. We had one of the worst experience ever. It was for a honeymoon, and we expected something special, and we had nothing. I strongly don't recommand this hotel. We had a problem with the laundry service, they screw up 3 clothes. Hopfully they reimbourse us a lillte bit, and they were really sorry, but we paid 2$ per kilo, normal price in vietnam is 1$, so we expected a better service. Everything was double price than normal. So I don't understand people which were happy…"
2142,"It started with the welcome drink (non alcoholic) ridiculous , I got a coffee my wife a coke.  It progressed to the restaurant, coq au Vin ( bowl full of bones). A ridiculous starter plate of oil and balsamic with two inch by inch stale bits of bread. Then the beach you can’t swim at ( only mid calf walking) .  The red flags were out the entire time , even we thought we’d swim at much worse conditions at home. The pool while clean is at best 1.4mt deep.  The staff are for the most part very pleasant, attentive  and try their best. In my opinion the management is completely sub standard. At one stage friends waited 40 minutes to be served at the bar , the manager came and abused the staff in front of guests. Management don’t train the staff, they panic when things get busy and we…"
2144,"Staff was friendly enough but the rooms and grounds need better maintenance (shower vents and weird oil stain on the wall). Rooftop pool closed for renovations but wasn’t informed until we asked how to get there. Gym is also closed for renovations, temporary setup is in a conference room. We unfortunately also saw cockroaches near the pool dining area (near the planters) which was really off putting. "
2145,"Greeted by a very pleasant and efficient receptionist. There was a glass of cava on arrival and clear instruction on out room locations and facilities. It was clean and decorated to a high standard. Great shower and comfy bed. Air con worked and was quiet. We had a room at the front (302) which was big enough for us as we were out each day and evening. We had breakfast once which was fresh, hot and plentiful. We ate once in the evening and had 4 different mains which were good value and cooked well. Would recommend this hotel as great price too ( booked through Booking.com)."
2146,"The “modern” feel is a gimmick. They put in snazzy carpets and fun pictures on the wall, but don’t be fooled into thinking you’re getting a nice room. Everything felt dirty even though it seemed clean. The bathroom and shower looked as if they ha don’t been updated In 30+ years. I needed a shower after using the shower in the room. Also, no air conditioners in the room at all. Not coming back. "
2147,"The Location is close to station and with easy walk of center. No Restaurant, Breakfast is good Quality, Rooms and over all hotel is Very Good. could not fault - No Restaurant is not an issue as Restaurant very local and good"
2148,"Ms Kumba (Hilton Garden Inn Magnificient Mile in Chicago) that was checking us out was extremly unproffessional and rude. She was ignoring us from the very beginning, serving people first that came without queining instead of us that were waiting for our turn. Turn after requesting business invoice she gave wrong document stating that she can't adjust as I don't understand the system and she ignored us again in order to serve other people and running away every time I tried to explain her what I need. Then she decided to amend my invoice but without listening what I need and because of that she was adjusting the invoice incorrectly around 5 times! Evrytime it was wrong I was explaining how it should look like she stated that I am rude and she refuses to correct this invoice and…"
2149,"Rooms/maid service and other staff throughout the hotel are exceptional. Breakfast just OK, but trying to self serve your food and use hot drink stations is chaotic and risky.....Regrettably breakfast is very like a 'car crash' waiting to happen. We loved the hotel and its people at all levels, and sincerely hope the new Muthu owners recognise how lucky they are to have the loyal and hardworking staff they employ. A lovely hotel with fabulous staff and gorgeous views. PS - For heavens sake replace the deplorable and dangerous sun beds around the pool! They would be thrown out in any good hotel throughout the EU, Caribbean, Asia, Africa etc"
2150,"The location is fantastic. Right next to the main train station and walking distance to all the main sights and Christmas markets.  Staff were friendly. The rooms were very very clean and although very simple, it was very comfortable and modern. Good shower and comfy bed.  I would reiterate what others have said about the lack of tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms which is pretty much standard these days. I missed my morning cuppa and this is the reason why this hotel does not get the five stars. Even if you could hire a kettle would be ok ! However, a good hotel and I would not hesitate to recommend it to friends. NB - also very good burger restaurant next door."
2151,"stayed here over Christmas, main areas of the hotel lacks character and atmosphere. bedrooms are large and spacious, I had one with sea view, several bars and restaurants within walking distance. stayed half board breakfast was good. evening meal you were not spoilt for choice. starters same every evening, mains two meat and one fish selection of veg, As hotel was not extra busy turn over of food slow. didn't get the all looks great not sure what to have factor Staff all very friendly and helpful. do not feel this is a four star minor things that I feel four star gives. When I arrive took own case into foyer then to room same when leaving. when by the pool no one cane to see if I would like a drink. Entertainment very amateurish and second rate. would I stay possible not"
2152,"This hotel is best described as form over function - it is very beautiful but has some faults. There is a very strange elevator system. There was lots of noise from renovations during the day. There are lots of electrical outlets that turn off when the lights are turned off at night. I could never get the desk lamp to work. The lights go out instantly when the key card is removed as one exits the room, rather than a few second delay as in most hotels.The shower cap package in the bathroom was empty. There is an overhead or hand-held shower but no mat or hand rails. There was a bit of a smell in the bathroom. The bed was good, and there were lots of pillows. Breakfast with piano music offered lots of choices, but the flavors were bland. Some tables were provided with salt and pepper, but not all. Toast was caught in the toaster and reported as it might have caught fire, but the report was ignored. There was no milk for tea, but it was tasty nonetheless. The safe worked one day but not the next. It is easy to pinch one's finger in the closet door. I was charged about 10 euros after I returned home for who knows what, but I figured it was too small an amount to complain about. I would look elsewhere on a return to Lisbon.…"
2153,"Reasonably-priced hotel with very good location and surprisingly quiet street. Walking distance to the metro station (5min). Hotel maybe is not the newest, but have clean & spacious rooms and good, solid breakfast with a lot of options. Reception was attentive and helpful so cant complain about service.  Minus- sewage smell in the room (first night), probably caused by rotted or cracked drain pipes."
2154,"We stayed her for 2 nights in July. The location is perfect, walking distance to everywhere. 1 block from the beach and less than 5 minutes to the train station. The hotel is a recently renovated boutique hotel. Very modern and comfortable. Our room had a queen bed. minibar, and nice bathroom. The room was on the small side, but that's what we usually find in France. Would recommend this lovely little hotel."
2155,"It was Super Bowl weekend and with it all the prices were super inflated. Would not stay here again at any price but especially not at the price we paid.   Room was small but clean. Bed was comfortable. Bathroom was not well suited for ladies :) it's got a pedestal style sink so absolutely no counter space to get ready.    Overall premise was less than desirable. It smelled so strongly of cleaner or terrible air freshener we wondered what they were trying to hide. It also features a nightclub right beside the hotel with people lined up in and around the main entrance.   It was very conveniently located in the heart of downtown close to union square, cable car and Bart as well as shopping.   "
2157,"The hotel is so centrally located for everything, bus and train station, shops, including designer shops, bars and restaurants all within very easy walking distance. The welcome we received was the best I've ever experienced, so friendly without appearing false. It was too early to get into our room however they offered to store our cases and gave us a map of the city. Later on in the day when we returned we were taken to our room, the cases had already been dropped off and our jackets hung up. The room was large, bright and spotless. We had a really nice balcony overlooking parts of the city and the hills. Although fairly near a busy road the soundproofing is excellent. Breakfast was good with different choices, bread pastries, hams and cheeses. All with fruit, yogurt and…"
2158,"Very easy going staff, very hospitable when we arrived at 730am due to an early flight and the owner let us sleep in the common room for a couple of hours and allowed us to eat breakfast! Beds comfortable and the hostel hosts meals 3 nights a week which are very enjoyable and a nice way to meet other guests. Would recommend "
2160,"Spent 2nights in hotel , good location , friendly stuff , but I would not recommend this hotel to ANYONE !!! FIRST OF ALL ITS DANGRROUS . The swimming pool on the roof top which they are so proud of is extremely unclean ... the water is not filtered , you can't even see your feet under water . Moreover when it's raining the pool is just filling with rain water because there is no protection . The water is just disgusting . The main idea was good but they didn't manage to do it in a right way . About the room , nothing special for the price , just want to notice that it's impossible to sleep there ....the noise starts from 6 am and you feel tired for the rest of the day ... About breakfast ....the worst breakfast in Vietnam. It looks bad and tastes bad.  "
2161,"We stayed in an economy compact room which had a small balcony. It was small but good for 1-2 nights, Mateo in reception was very helpful and pleasant. Breakfast of cold meats, cheese, juices, boiled egg, beverages, yoghurt, cereals, breads fresh fruits etc were included. Clean comfortable bed and aircon worked well. The location is great just a few minutes to La Rambla and Placa Catalunya. Lots of shopping and eating places next to the hotel. The wifi was excellent. We will definitely stay here again."
2162,"This Sheraton property is a funhouse mirror of Rio de Janeiro. It's beautiful, it's by the beach, it's purportedly luxurious. Peek a bit under the surface and it's disorganized, dishonest and disappointing.   During our two day stay, we changed rooms three times. The first time, the hotel put us in a room with a view of an air conditioner that you could basically access with a ladder from Avenida Niemeyer. Then the hotel put us in a room where, 5 minutes after we walked in, a KLM pilot walked in with the same key to the same room. It feels pretty terrible to tell a 747 pilot to take a hike - also since computerization these things are not supposed to occur. Finally, we ended up in a very nice suite after complaining, but on the last day got a phone call 15 minutes before…"
2163,"My son and I had an unexpected layover in Chicago on our trip home from Stockholm, Sweden.  We used our ever faithful Marriott Card to locate a hotel, they graciously found us a room.  I was kept on the phone  and put on hold a number of times trying to arrange a pickup.  Finally, we took a cab.  We were greeted by a surly receptionist.   The hotel lobby was beautfiul.  We reached our room and asked that the sofa bed be made up, we were handed a mattress pad and a sheet.  After two more requests it was done.  Door knobs were hanging off the door, a bathrobe in the closet was so filthy it couldn't be worn.  I was relieved to check out."
2164,Arrived to the hotel just too late to go to a local restaurant. I decided to have dinner in the gourmet restaurant. Bad choice. No menu card was presented to me and I was only asked: “buffet?” Given this one option I took the buffet. No offer to have some thing to drink. The buffet appeared to be  sashimi or sashimi. The waiter then asked :”beef?” Which I accepted and got a steak that was fair. Finally I find a waiter that speak English and I ask for something to drink and a desert card. I only got my 7up - menu card never came.   First time I used the toilet it went broken.   The breakfast was below average and the coffee was not drinkable. Bad taste of cheap coffee beans.  Location of hotel is excellent- but be prepared- the hotel isn’t.   
2165,"Outdated furniture, dirty hallways, peeling paint and poor construction.  Uncomfortable place to find oneself if stuck in San Francisco.  Don't assume just because it has the name HILTON that it will be anywhere worth what your will be paying.  If you have a car, it's DOUBLY WORSE!! Their ""valet service"" charges $65 to park your car in a $25 a night, nearby garage you can find and park yourself.  The place smells and the furniture is uncomfortable, torn and dirty.  The environment is FRENZIED!  Right smack dab in the middle of the busiest part of San Francisco (which one could count as a bonus if you know that the famous Chinese restaurant Sam Wo is across the street) ...but, if your seeking comfort and quiet in a clean room....forget it!  The elevators are slow with more than…"
2166,Hi all  Rooms are pretty small for the price we pay  Swimming pool and other amenities are well maintained   But complimentarty  break fast is horrible due to following reasons 1. Representation of dishes are below average 2. Staff response is very much slow clear used plates on table  3. Some dishes really not authentic like idly it's too bad than a local roadside and also the chutney is not tender  4. Fruit and veggies salads not up to the stanadards 
2167,"I and my wife spent 3 nights at Novotel Shanghai Atlantis at superior room executive floor. Receptions are great warm welcome. I was offered Nespresso and soft--drink. This help a lot after a long transfer from Beijing. They also give me a travel map and explain attraction spot, what a great service here. It is all the good thing here.  After I got key room on 31 floor, I realized that my room is not on executive floor and the worst is... it is the lowest guest floor. I'm not sure it is superior room or standard room but it make me feel so bad with this hotel. Even the benefit letter for executive room is not given to me. I know nothing about benefit here.   Room is clean. Even hotel mention that room is fully renovated but I think it could be better than this.   I had breakfast…"
2169,Yosh was very unpleasant to speak to. 20 minutes of our hotel check in I recieve a call saying your kids voice is loud and would have to vacate the hotel if anymore guests complain. My kids were not screaming but were talking in little loud voice I agree but the manager himself says the insulation is very thin. There is fire engine sound every half hour in the night .. they dont have problems with that but.. I originally planned to stay here for 3 nights but vacated after the first night because of managers behaviour and unpleasant attitude. This hotel is not kids friendly as they state.
2170,"Just pure luck! That's how I came across this Gem! Long story short, at the last minute I had  to find a hotel to stay for one night. It is Fashion Week in Paris and most hotels are all booked. I wanted to stay in Pyramides Opera. I came across this hotel while walking around the neighborhood and walked in the reception where Melodie pleasantly greeted me and confirmed an opening and a very affordable rate. I booked it!. At checked in I was greeted by Guillaume who was absolutely wonderful and helpful and courteous. That evening Arnaud who was working was equally helpful, I was insomniac and wide awake at 2am he was kind enough to provide me with a complimentary snack and juices he was just charming. The way I rate my hotels is first by Service Excellence and Cleanliness and…"
2171,"We recently had 11 days in this lovely hotel and enjoyed most of it.  The staff are all excellent and the facilities are very good.  We were unfortunate that our excellent apartments (we had two) were overlooking a building site for the deck and restaurant. It was so noisy, no lazy lie ins for us. It should be finished shortly and then it will be excellent.  The owners/management could do with looking at their sales process as there as so many missed opportunities for resident sales and also the website is covering what will be there not necessarily what is there currently.  All those things apart, as I say the staff are wonderful, the rooms immaculate and nothing too much trouble.  The spa is excellent and I had a wonderful massage on my birthday from Magdalene and I was also…"
2172,Hotel room was excellent and the staff very friendly and helpful. Do not bother with having breakfast there as its overpriced cold and sometimes very little choice. Better off having breakfast at one of the many cafes near by
2173,"Wow, my first experience with a $90 resort fee! The online reservation system should include the resort fee in the price quote. Extremely deceptive and misleading marketing practice. The online rate looks attractive until you look at check out that they added $90 to a weekend stay. This hotel is in no way a resort. I was on a business trip and this is basically a 3.5 star hotel.  Ridiculous practice that should be banned . Include resort fees in your online listing."
2174,This is the nastiest hotel ever! This hotel does not change the duvets unless a stain is visible. Maybe if your ladies on floor 13 stop talking so loudly in the hallways everyone wouldn't know we are sleeping on dirty/ recycled duvets.
2175,Delightful staff. Good location. Near clean. Not a great area of town. But near station. Shopping centre near by. Graffiti everywhere on nearby building do not a great Environmemt and next to back packers. So a little at odds with normal Hampton joy
2176,"Helpful friendly staff, the perfect location to access all that Cannes and the surrounding areas has to offer and homely, comfortable rooms, what more could you ask for when booking a hotel that lives up to its price tag. Excellent value for money, I reccommend this hotel to anyone looking for their home away from home while travelling through France."
2177,"Very good location. Central and nice surroundings. Very friendly staff and great variety of choices for breakfast. We had chosen the hotel primarily due to location and the fact that it had a roof top pool & bar. Due to windy (although warm) weather the pool area was closed, which was a bit of a disappointment... Modern, very fresh and quite big rooms though. Lobby bar squeezed in and not very inviting..."
2178,"Hotel is ok.  Service is very slow with little care for pleasing the client.  I waited 20 minutes for the scrambled eggs to be replenished at breakfast, after repeatedly asking about status.  Bar was entirely empty with one lone bartender waiting for service.  Room service was awful.  I would think there are better places to stay in Lisbon than here."
2180,"I arrived at 10 pm after a LONG day in a fair and I just wanted a soup or a tea... nothing, the restaurante was closed and there is no room service, they told me that  could walk 2 blocks to take in a ""padaria"" a tea if I want... Could you imagine a lady walking two blocks to have a tea???"
2181,"My wife and I stayed here for a trip to see a Chicago Bears game. It was not s good experience.  When we travel, and we do it alot, we frequently stay at IHG hotels and Intercontinentals where they have them. We are longtime Intercontinental status holders from trips in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. So believe me when I say our stay here this was not up to par. Mostly, I blame that on the reception desk manager Demetrius. This person made sure we didn't get our ""guaranteed"" status upgrade, nor any of the other benefits (water in the room, fruit plate, welcome gift, free drink, etc.) while taking more than 30 mins to check us in. We complained to him personally, and even after that he did not apologize or recognize us when he saw us.  The room he put us in was sorely in need of…"
2183,It was a fine stay at this hotel. The service very friendly and could help in any problems someone has. The room was clean and invites for a nice stay. The location of the hotel was very fine and you could reach every other locations with  public trains very easily.
2184,"I love W hotels and I think I always will. But something is going on with the check in process... I have stayed in over 5 W hotels in the last year and i have trouble check in intel of them. Even though their policy says you can start check in at 3 pm , it can be 5 pm and you still don’t have a room. This happened in Amsterdam and it seems the global policy is to offer a cocktail at the bar... which not everybody wants, like me. Besides it does not solve the issue that you don’t have a room... sometimes my trips are quick and I only stay one night... anyway... the amount of miscommunication between the spa that I was using and the desk for check in was incredible, the way it was handled was always polite but it never gave a sensation of people actually caring and connecting with…"
2185,"Wonderful location and delicious breakfast with a great selection and many items that gluten-free people can eat.  Exceptionally clean hotel.  Friendly and accommodating staff.  Know that the rooms are much smaller in Europe so keep that in mind.    The hotel was in walking distance to Notre Dame and many excellent cafes and restaurants  It was a very long walk to Champs d Elysee but you can take a city bus all over Paris for 2 euros.  Uber is there too and all the vehicles are black and gorgeous with good looking, classy drivers."
2186,"This 4 star superior hotel is located in a very strategic point.  You can reach pretty much everything from there and very well connected to the airports. Check in was easy and quick as well as check out.  People are friendly and professional. The inside of the hotel looks pretty new and bright,  white is the main color. Rooms and bathrooms are very light and they come with a good design. The bed could be more comfortable though. There is a mini bar as well as a nespresso machine and a kettle. Whenever you need anything,  you just have to call and they are ready to satisfy you as soon as possible. I didn't try their breakfast so I cannot say anything about it. It's definitely a very good hotel to stay at."
2187,We stayed at 25h hotel on our first visit to Berlin and we loved the experience.   Although we could not visit much the Monkey Bar it is clearly a plus  The chilling out zone at the reception area was really cool and relaxing especially when there was 30C outside!  Original and functional rooms. The only issue is the lack of blinds (just curtains) when sun rises circa 4am!!!  I recommend the experience  
2188,"Was the Golden Tulip and friends had used before. The rooms are clean, well equiped and comfortable. Everything worked and we did not experience a problem with noise. Our big problem was that the Hotel is now alcohol free. This would not be a problem but there are no bars locally for a nightcap with friends. Food was more expensive than the town centre and not of a good quality. Staff were very helpful. Checkin all on computer and very easy to use. Handy for the town - 15 mins by tram"
2189,"Even though their web-site advertises internet in their rooms this was not the case. I had to stay on the first floor to get a very unreliable wi-fi signal from their lobby. Staff were uninterested when I brought this to their attention. The walls seem to be made out of paper as I could not sleep until 2 AM due to noise coming from the room next door. When I called Reception to ask for this to be brought up to the guests' attention they told me ""do it yourself"". I would not recommend this mediocre hotel with terrible service to anyone travelling on business."
2190,"This is a cheap hotel, so do not expect anything far from what you are paying. The hotel is close to the Carioca metro station and offers a cheap breakfast etc. The front desk is fast and helpful, so if you want to stay cheap, it is an option."
2191,"This is a business hotel so it is a bit impersonal but makes a comfortable base for tourists. Clean, comfortable with a (very small) gym and a sauna. I was pleased to get a kettle and tea in the room which is not always available in these hotels We really enjoyed the view of the river and watching dawn break over central Berlin. It's near the park so some good walks but you'll need to use bus or train to get to the major sights. Transport is really easy though once you've sorted out the good-value tickets."
2192,Located right by the Gothic Quarter you can't beat the location. We are greeted with champagne and friendly reception staff. Lobby is very small but hotel is very nice. The room is small but layout is excellent and spacious. Bathroom is tight for two people but well appointed.  Pros: Location Clean Nice room and okay for two people  Cons: small bathroom little pricey compared to similar hotels we've stayed in
2193,"We liked the hotel for its central location (close enough to the sights of Brandenburg Gate, Konzerthaus, Checkpoint Charlie etc.) We did a loop of these sights on the first day, and the Berlin Cathedral, Alexanderplatz Christmas Markets, East Side Gallery etc. on the second day, making use of the S-bahn from Friederichstraße station as our feet tired!   The room itself was clean, well appointed. Only things we will say were it was too cold in the room and we couldn’t seem to get it any warmer through the air system (was minus 1 outside on the day we arrived). Secondly, the pillows were uncomfortable. One under your head was not enough and two was too much. "
2194,"my room was not cleaned (pizza boxes and garbage), charged twice for overnight parking, manager would not reverse this. terrible experience. I would not recommend this hotel, it is in need of a remodel and service upgrade. "
2196,"The hostel is in such great location and the price you pay for it is awesome! Amsterdam is not a cheap city so don't try hard looking for cheap hostels. This one right here is one of the best. They have happy hour every day. The rooms are nice and you get your own bathroom with each room they also give you towels which is amazing, you get free breakfast and the staff is very, very nice! The only thing i complained about was the AC, that in my opinion wasn't working very well.  Keep in mind that Amsterdam is a party city so you won't get a quiet night of sleep but I am pretty sure most people go to Amsterdam to party ;)"
2197,The hotel has stunning view but the rooms are old from inside. The staff and service was excellent. The room service food was terrible both the times. They can make that better. Overall location was good. 
2198,Waiting for a connection at the nearby coach terminal I went for lunch at the Corinthia Hotel.  It was a lovely day so I decided on the 'Outdoors Restaurant' which looked very attractive though there were very few customers besides myself and my friends. The service was extremely slow and at times we felt forgotten. Fortunately I had three hours to kill. The food portions were small though tasty and very well presented. Seeing the small size of our main meal we ordered some further dishes. We were all a little disappointed.
2199,"We had a nice welcome at the hotel and was given 2 free beer vouchers which was nice. The hotel room we booked was an executive double on the top floor, the room was very clean, the bed was huge and extremely comfortable, toiletries were all there. My only criticism is no iron, I think in an executive room which is probably used a lot by business people really needs this in the room. All in all a great stay and will book again if in Berlin."
2200,Our 5th stay at this hotel and this time with family members. It was adequate but not outstanding. The hotel would greatly benefit from an update. Room was comfortable and you can’t beat the unobstructed ocean view. The location is awesome with only a 15 minute walk to the centre of Funchal. We took in the Madeira night buffet dinner but we were a bit disappointed with the lack of food selection and it’s quality. The grounds are excellent and the pools are clean and enjoyable. The one pool supposed to be heated but we didn’t find it that warm. Our Room and bathroom were clean with ample towels. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Nightly entertainment was lacking. Good choices of restaurants near by. All in all a decent place to stay. 
2201,"Room mate Anna is like being with a friend that knows you well enough to have your unique treats waiting for you when you arrive. You feel at home. The positives first. 1. The location is spot on with everything you'll want to visit in Barcelona. It's located in a high end area, posh shops on the doorstep and Guadi's delights are walking distance. 2. The metro Passeig de Gràcia is virtually right outside the hotel. 3. The welcome from the staff is warm, friendly and extremely helpful. The staff in the breakfast area is run by a formidable woman called Marta who was helpful and caters to your gastronomic needs. Breakfast is substantial, a glorious choice in a spacious seating area. If your gluten/lactose intolerant you won't be overlooked.  4. The rooms are huge, luxurious and…"
2202,"This hotel is pretty awful. The lobby is all torn up and totally disgusting. The protestors are screaming all day long — it’s so loud. Apparently they have been there for 2 months.   They have built this creepy entrance with guards everywhere. The hotel put out a basket of earplugs, which I thought was ridiculous, but sadly they came in handy.   The rooftop bar was closed for some event, and the elevators were turned off so we got stuck on the 38th floor. When we asked for an alternative, one hotel employee said, “try the Hilton.”  Indeed.   I would have more patience with them had all this disorder not carried such a hefty price tag."
2203,"We paid $1,000 for two-night stay for two rooms I would have thought that we would have gotten a little peace and quiet but we were put right next to the janitor's room and there was noise 24/7 also a lot of parking spaces were blocked because they had water damage cleanup and they had tree trimmers throughout both days we were there it was a pretty unpleasant stay for the price we were charged"
2204,"Below is the review and feedback sent to hotel as they asked for feedback.  I am always very honest with my feedback with our travels and I'll be the same here.  At the start we were very disappointed and almost checked out of the hotel completely, see below points.  * Your Driver on pick up was rude and laughed in my face cause I'm bigger than the normal person, not only was this a big turn off with the first contact point of your property but the driver was in ripped jeans, no uniform, didn't introduce himself. For a property of Vinpearl size and standing within the hotel industry we were expecting a property car to collect us not some rude well under dressed private contractor. We have stayed in much lesser class hotels in Saigon and around the world and been picked up with a…"
2205,"I was very disappointed with the room and service of this hotel. The only good thing they have is location.   We stayed here from the 2nd to the 12th, we had 3 adults and 1 child aged one and a half. The largest room they have is not suitable for families. When I asked if they could do something to help me, I was pretty much told NO as I did not book straight through the hotel. The point of this is to let people know the photos are not what they seem. We could only walk down the middle of the beds not the sides as there is not enough room. My son couldn’t fit in the crib/cot that they have it’s too small. The pool area is tiny and not even a place that you can just go relax. We tried to stay out of our room as much as possible and even found sitting in the lobby some what…"
2206,"The hotel is an old palace very beautiful. It has two buildings: one is the Palace which serves as the lobby , bar and restaurant. The other building has the bedrooms. The hotel has a nice swimming pool. Breakfast is very good. Now for the bad: I was given a bedroom with a bed that was set with two single beds. That is somewhat common. The problem is that apart from being two separate beds, the bed was arranged as two separate beds . That was very inconvenient for me and kind of ruined the stay. Another minor problem is that to access your room you have to enter the palace , take the elevator and then go to the other building."
2207,"Kerry has always been my preferred hotel on business trip due to its locality (mall, metro and taxi). However, this stay has been horrible!  1. Checked in the room, I was naive enough thinking the hotel is on cost savings by providing less room facilities. Only to find out later that I was not on the Executive Floor though I have paid the price for Club Room. Note that I have booked the room 3 weeks ahead and being a frequent guest. Left a note before going to work and came back seeing they tried to furnish the room to as an Exec room. Then, I got a called to offer me to change room. No packing and unpacking as it’s a 9 nights for me. Only request them to furnish the room as best as they can which it failed. Lack of water refilled. Poor service. Maybe the hotel is having too…"
2209,"We stayed a week from May 11 and had so much help in deciding what to do and how to do it, by the hotel’s concierge, Marc. He couldn’t have been more helpful and we were able to see so many of Berlin’s attractions due to to him. He procured tickets for us, to ‘Vivid’ a show we would heartily recommend.  The service by all at the hotel was excellent and appreciated. Thanks to all."
2210,"We were delighted with the standard of the accommodation, the service and the location of the suites. The apartments are stylish, clean and well equipped. An ideal location from which to explore this vibrant, exciting city."
2211,"After paying over $600 for 2 nights to attend a family member's wedding, I arrived the Crown Plaza early on check in day.  I had called ahead to ask for early check in.  Be advised, early check in does not happen here.  I was told there was no room and given ZERO options on what do with myself for the next 5 hours I would be waiting to get into my $600 room.  I wasn't even told where the bathroom was, or where I could grab a bite to eat.  I was informed though that I had booked through Orbitz, which was presented to me with an air of disdain, and therefore early check in was not guaranteed. I corrected the incredibly poor excuse for a front desk staff person by advising him that I had requested that through the IHG number and attached my account number to the reservation.  As I…"
2212,"Stayed here for 4 nights. Fantastic hotel. Clean, quirky, friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. Great location too, far enough away from the bustle to be reasonably priced but a 15 min walk to the Louvre. Will be going back at some point.  "
2213,"Staff speaks very good English and is very nice. Furniture in the room is a little oldish. When I entered my room the bottle of water was already opened and half drunk. We had to pay an additional 10€ per person to access the spa facility 1 day valid). I have honestly been disappointed by all of this. Therefore, I skipped the breakfast so I cannot judge it. Not used to this kind of situation in this kind of luxury hotels. Maybe due to my Chinese standards... "
2214,It is hard to find hotels in Paris that accommodate 5 people in one room.  Helzear Suites had several options with 2 bedrooms priced competitively with other 1-room hotels in the area.  So we found it to be a great value.  The location is excellent!  5 minute walk to L'Arc de Triomphe and all of the tour busses; 5 minute walk to the Seine and views of the Eiffel Tower.  10 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower.  Supermarket around the corner.  Our room on the 6th floor had a view of the top of the Eiffel Tower from our Bedroom and balcony!  Always well staffed and the staff was very nice.  Ines was particularly enthusiastic and helpful.  My one suggestion?  Complimentary Coffee and Water in the Lobby would be nice.    We would happily return.
2215,"Good 3 star hotel. Staff all very helpful, room and room facilities really good. The location is right next to the metro and it’s quick and easy to travel to the airport too. The hotel is also only about half an hour walk from the centre and is in a safe but less touristy area which we appreciated. There are some great wine bars and restaurants in the 11th too. "
2216,"Probably the best hostel I've stayed in.  Decent facilities, quality of everything was decent and good value for money.  Ideal location to get around. Staff on the desk were helpful and the ensuite in the bedroom was good quality.  Cant fault the place and would go back in a shot."
2217,"I’m amazed by the positive reviews for this place. I can only assume I was given the worst room in the whole hotel.  I booked 3 nights in one of their “Luxury Oceanview Rooms” only to check-in and be given a city-view room. This wasn’t a huge issue; the main problem was that my room had a large hole cut in the wall, presumably to service the air conditioning unit outside, which was then haphazardly covered with a sheet of plywood and an ill-fitting cabinet door (see photos). This meant that I could hear all the noise from the street outside – traffic, car horns, the kids playing at the elementary school down the street. The noise woke me up early in the morning and it was impossible to sleep during the day. I complained to the front desk but was told that no other rooms were…"
2218,Coming to the end of a 10 night stay and very little to fault this place for.  We have a large bed plus separate sofa bed in kitchen/lounge which works great as we have two children.   About 20mins walk from nicest Barcelona beach and 5 mins from metro. We have walked miles as so easy to get to Port Olympic. Sagrada Familia etc.   Laundry facilities in basement are fantastic after a trip to the beach - and free.   Only had breakfast here once and whilst very good buffet it is on the pricey side.  Carrot cafe and Shaka and Shake nearby all must be tried.   Don't be put off by immediate surroundings - a lot of work going on in what appears to be an up and coming area. 
2219,"Stayed here while visiting my daughter. First morning at the hotel my curling iron blew sparks as I was getting ready and doing my hair. Curling iron fine afterwards, outlet needed checking? Got moved to another room and in the closet there was a small slightly open little door that opened to an old creepy utility shaft. Dropped coins down it and heard it tap on pipes a loooong way down. This is unacceptable as a child falling in that would be injured badly or worse. Also creepy af because wind whistling in there. The whole place is threadbare, creepy, accessible to anyone as no lobby security or elevator scan, just yuck. I'm a 52 year old woman and not easily riled but this place is indescribably creepy on many levels and I hate it. I want to love it because it's old and…"
2220,"The hotel is really very minimalistic in it's amenities, offers rooms that are boring, scanty, devoid of any charm.  The hotel enjoys an excellent location, very close to the highway, to the Kista Galleria mall and to the nearby office district. It boasts a fancy, beautiful all glass exterior - almost a landmark building. But then that is it.  As you walk in, you find a reception area that is wide, open, inviting and offering oodles of space for just hanging out, sit with friends, family or even hold informal office meetings. The seats and couches are plenty and comfy.  As you take the elevators up to the rooms, is when things become really, really boring. You get a room that is really minimalistic in every sense of the word. An open, tiny little wardrobe that you will find good…"
2221,"Beautiful surprise in the middle of Paris ! We enjoy the pool, hammam and sauna. Very nice room for couple. Great breakfast. I recommend it if you want to cut off the world and take time for yourself. "
2223,"Location is great, right by several metro stations. Rooms were clean. The decor of the hotel was definitely catering to tourists, which did not bother us at all. The breakfast was really good with lots of options all of which we tried were delicious. Staff was friendly and had no problems communicating with in English."
2224,"smack in the middle of western berlin, right next to Zoologischer Garten train station, this hotel is fairly new and delivers what people love about Motel One: good budget quality at a bargain price. The rooms are small, but modern and quiet, breakfast a good bargain, and the place even has a decent bar. What else do you need for a short stay?"
2226,"A security guard who identified himself as a police officer forced entry into my room using his key card. There was no prior warning or notice of noise coming from my super king suite. My gf, me, and 3 other well dressed couples were having polite laughs on the 10 person couch in my suite when the said police officer barged in and told us we had 15 minutes to vacate and get out. He was unable to address me respectfully or reason with me. When I spoke to the supervisor on duty she confirmed that she didnt bother to call and was smug about evicting us. I remained as polite when I left as when I arrived. I wont be back!"
2228,"Wifi NOT included in Room Rate, the potato chips and soda For sale in the room Gives it a feel Of Staying in A convenience store or 7-11. Room decor was outdated and not on par with a 4 star hotel, unimpressed.   The Room Fridge was packed with more stuff for sale leaving no room for me to store anything- I don't think that nickel and diming your guests makes for a pleasant or memorable experience. The location and staff were the best things about the hotel, but for the same price I would recommend other hotels that offer way more amenities included in room rate and modern facilities- I definitely won't be staying there again or recommending. I am actually kinda disappointed because I expected so much more from a W Hotel. :/  I Really Hope they Read this."
2229,very good services and location but noise between the street and the other rooms.The desk people are very friendly and helped us in our services research.the bedroom and the bathroom were very clean..       
2230,"Obviously, you can stay somewhere in the center, but I prefer to stay off-center, not just because it's cheaper but because I like to see the non-touristy parts of a city, too. So this hotel satisfied my needs. It's in a residential part of Berlin, and if I'm on a holiday, I don't mind taking the public transport to get to to the more obvious points of interest, and see some parts of the non-touristy city, too, in the meanwhile.  This is a hotel + hostel establishment, my friend and I stayed in the hotel part, and we had no complaints at all. The staff at the reception desk is nice, the room is good and clean, there are good restaurants nearby, and it's easy to get to a station from where you can reach the more central parts of the city."
2232,"This is a review I also posted on another site:   One star. Only because I can't give zero.   We knew we were coming to South Beach at the tail end of Spring Break. We expected there to be some level of revelry at the hotel and were prepared for that, but the point of our trip was rest and relaxation. We even called ahead and asked to make sure that we were selecting the right kind of hotel for what we were looking for - we were told it was ""chill vibe"" and ""laid back"", and further up on the South Beach strip so it is quieter.  What they neglected to tell us when we booked (via Expedia), is that it was the end of the Ultra festival, there was a pool party every Sunday night, and that the clientele is loud, drunk and likely to be vomiting next to you.   We booked a three night…"
2233,"Decided to surprise my 12 year old daughter and take a last second weekend trip to Barcelona. Staying at the Ilunion in Barcelona was great. 5 min walk to the beach, a lovely street with restaurants around the corner and a 10 min walk,if that to the metro,which takes you into the city in like 15 mins. Rooftop pool is nice, room and bathroom are spacious. We both agreed we would come back and stay again. Great trip."
2234,"He add s up 40.00 to park to start, other hotels offer free parking and are nicer.  We received a room asked for a quiet room and received a room 2 doors from the loudest ice machine I have ever heard.  Asked to move and the guy on the phone told me I was far from the ice machine...I told him to hold on and sitting on the bed I could hear it making ice not even dumping it yet...he was hesitate  but switched rooms, we of course had to go back down stairs and wait in line again.  This would be again fine but we had our 8 year old and there was a dominatrix convention, try explaining that to an 8 year old boy.  Finally at the front of the line the guy helping us doesn't  know what we are talking about but finally gives us a room on a floor with no ice machine.  Awesome, we get…"
2236,Rooms are very spacious. Each floor has a sitting area with extremely comfortable sofas which lull you into a relaxed mood. Very conducive to engage into some reading outside your own room. Staff are very pleasant with a caring attitude. They seem to be very willing to engage with guests to make their as memorable as possible. A wide range of tastes is catered for in the restaurant.
2237,"Lovely villa at the heart of the city,less than 10 minutes walk from the seafront. The rooms are beautifully decorated and spotlessly clean.  Breakfast was continental ,self service and plentiful. The proprietor, Christophe, was very helpful especially with local information about interesting places to visit ,best places to eat etc . He was very attentive and appeared to take a genuine interest in all his guests . If you're visiting Cannes I would highly recommend this very reasonably priced,beautiful villa"
2238,"Where to start... As mentioned in a previous review, we stayed when a large group of Mexican students arrived late at night with no respect or regard to other guests. We tried to ignore the constant screaming, shouting, slamming of doors and noise until at 2am we couldn't stand it anymore. It didn't help that our first night checking in we were kept up by noisy neighbours (the walls are quite literally paper thin). I can't say we enjoyed hearing someone elses snoring or loud shouting into the early hours and so we politely the next day spoke to the staff who offered us another room (we didn't take it as those guests were leaving). Back to the chaos that was Friday night - poor guy on the front desk was trying to handle all the many complaints but really there wasn't much he…"
2239,"We stayed here for 3 nights last week when holidaying in Berlin. We were greeted by a very friendly and welcoming man (wish we’d got his name!) and even though we were a couple of hours early, he told us our room was ready for check in now. We had a standard double room and even though it wasn’t the biggest room ever, it has everything we needed and was immaculately clean. The beds were very comfortable and the shower was decent. We were located on the 4th floor so had a nice view from the window. The location was perfect for us : 5 minutes walk from checkpoint charlie and attractions around there, 15 to 20 minutes from the mall, Reichstag etc and about 5 minutes to the Gendarmenmarkt square which had plenty of places to eat and drink. The only place we had to get the U-Bahn to…"
2240,"We loved Hotel Henri IV Rive Gauche.  The location is fantastic and the staff very helpful.  Lots of sights and restaurants within easy walking distance.  Rooms and bathrooms are smallish by U.S. standards, but the same as you would find in major metropolitan areas in the U.S.  We will stay here again!"
2241,For seeing Berlin this is a perfect location. You are literally 2 minutes from a tube/subway station and only 2 minutes from Checkpoint Charlie. The hotel is comfortably and all you would expect from a quality hotel.  We were on the 7th floor and so had a great view. I only have one complaint - the breakfast.  It really isn't anything special at all. It looks a lot better than it tastes and is a real disappointment.  I can not see how they justify charging 17 euros each - it simply isn't worth it.  To add insult to injury they only charge 10 euros to customers off the street!??   If you book rooms here and breakfast is not included in your rate then go and get a better breakfast in the lovely bakery just up the road or walk out of the hotel around the corner and into the hotel…
2243,"We booked this hotel at the last minute after our previous booking at a luxurious hotel was automatically cancelled. We then decided to stay at this budget hotel as it offers a family suite which is composed of two rooms ( one double and one single) and meet our family's needs. The rooms of this suite are small but comfortable. Each room is equipped with an air conditioner and a TV. The air conditioners worked perfectly and could be adjusted at any temperature which we love it. (In France, some air conditioning room does not provide real A/C but just A/C look fans.) The staff are very friendly and the location is great. About 15  minutes walk to Galaries Lafayette and Printemps. 15 minutes walk to Le Mur de Je t'aime and Moulin Rouge. 20 minutes walk to Sacre coeur so we could…"
2244,"Booked via Expedia. No where was it communicated that the hotel's lobby was under construction and the restaurant was gone. Highly advise not to stay here. Rooms are extremely noisy - literally could hear the people walking above me and the persons tv in the next room. Does not even compare to the pictures. As a female, I did not feel safe at this hotel either. The door didn't even have a deadbolt. Talked to fellow hotel patrons and they agreed as well that they will never be back. "
2245,"It's ok I guess, everything needs to be renovated. And I am afraid to touch everything because I might get germs, because carpet everywhere. The breakfast is kinda sad. #sadboys Don't expect much. Even the music is 70's disco mostly. "
2246,"Specifically Martin who works by the bar. Without his help, I would have not seen so many attractions and heard such great insights into the local life of Berlin. He told me about all the trendy spots and where to go, and was very informative in general. He was probably the most helpful staff at this hotel, and the reason it actually got a 5 star review. Otherwise it’s still a hotel, but he really bumps is what made it that much better."
2247,"I booked three rooms. I had nothing but problems, & the staff really wasn’t all that helpful, like they didn’t care. I’ve stayed with them before for our weekend getaways & I usually love this place. But this last time really did it. It was our wedding weekend. I have the app and always use the app. I do the check in the night before and ask for digital keys. We arrived at 3:30pm. And my key wasn’t working. I go to front desk and they tell me the room isn’t ready. So then we have to tell the valet to send my wedding dress & luggage to front desk instead of straight to our room. Our room wasn’t what I expected either. I asked for a jr suite. Not a standard room. It didn’t feel like the jr suite I stayed at before. That was also disappointing. But because I paid for everything…"
2248,Wonderful location woderful hotel will recommend it to all very clean very good breakfast good price very close to metro station room size is great comparing with other hotels in paris the additional snack and free minibar is a plus that u can enjoy in all astotels 
2249,"The location is just perfect, a short walk to Alexanderplatz- a major transportation and commercial hub in the city. Some attractions are just a few minutes walk away. I booked for 2 nights in a dorm room, the room had a huge glass window offering a metropolitan view. Each room have 1 toilet and 1 toilet and bath. Lockers were rather small or could just fit important things such as laptops and documents. The staff were friendly and helpful. The beds were extra comfortable and it's hard to leave when you wake up. However, the pillows are rather small. Wifi was a bit frustrating as its performance intermittently lags so bad that I needed to go down to the lobby several instances. Evenings can be rowdy specially during happy hours as there is a bar/ restaurant in the ground floor…"
2250,"Yurbban Passage is a fantastic hotel, situated in a great location, a quiet part of the city but near to everything you could want. As other guests have said the hotel is well designed, contemporary, relaxing and with great facilities, the rooftop is a real highlight. The staff were really friendly and the room itself is well presented. I wouldn't hesitate to come back but a few minor points could do with addressing/improving to make this a real gem of Barcelona:  Breakfast is quite pricey about €19 euros per person but slightly cheaper if you book it for all the nights you stay. Most mornings breakfast was good but one morning it was particularly busy and we had to ask for more bowls, spoons, milk and butter. Other guests also had to ask for stuff that had run out. Perhaps they…"
2251,"I had over a week in Paris for work/conference and am so happy that i stayed at Hotel A La Villa Des Artistes. The room was very cozy, with a very nice bathroom and beautiful window that opened to a very nice view. The staff was very helpful and friendly and I loved the neighborhood. Very close to Luxembourg Garden, great for running in the morning. I would definitely book again if I have the opportunity to return to Paris."
2252,"We stayed here for three nights and check in was very good and efficient . Had booked a junior suite which we got although the view was abit off . The one thing that annoyed me about this hotel was the concierge who had no clue of all the places we wanted to go . I mean why have an international brand hotel and your concierge cannot speak english or know most places that tourists require to know. We where looking for a western union and there had no clue at all when we wondered off to radison blue just down the road and asked there where spot on. The location is very good and the check in and check out was a plus. Breakfast was abit expensive so we choose to eat outside. Have a currency machine in the hotel which was quite handy ,watch out for the con man just outside the hotel…"
2253,"Yellow Nest was my first hostel, and I have to say, it was pleasant. There is a fantastic kitchen downstairs along with communal computers (50 cents/15 minutes), vending machines and a small bookshelf. The hostel was about a 7 minute walk to the nearest train station. There was also a single sex washroom with three toilets and three showers on our floor. They have individual large lockers in the rooms but they do not have locks so make sure you bring your own, otherwise you can pay £3 for a one. We decided to take the train from the airport to the hostel because the website had said it was the quickest route, however, it turns out that we arrived too late to catch the train and ended up taking a bus and then a cab the rest of the way. Also, there was a new young woman at the…"
2255,I recently stayed at this hotel back in June. I booked 2 hotel rooms 6 months in advance for my bachelorette party and requested the rooms to be close to each other. A week before arriving I called in advanced to double check my reservation. They couldn't find it. Lucky I saved my confirmation number. After finding my reservation I asked when check in was. The women told me 3 pm. Planned my Travel time and dinner reservations around this time. When I arrive at 3 pm they tell me they can't find my reservations again. Again I gave them my conformation number. SAVE YOURS. After finding my reservation My room is not ready and they say check in is at 4... I said that's not what the women told me on the phone. The front desk just shrugged his shoulders and said they would text me when…
2257,"Having been recently refurbished the hotel is in good condition although it still shows some signs of age, particularly on the 'garden' side on which the rooms look onto a cliff face. The hotel location is perfect being so close to Dona Ana beach which the front facing rooms only can view. The Continental breakfast is a bit of a zoo being served in the bar and not too many tables. The hotel advertises Satellite TV which is true, however, there are no English speaking channels, not even a News channel."
2258,"The mattress and the pillow was very bad. Very small hard pillow. I sleep not well at all.Other things was good, good location, nice design, but very bad quality / price value.300€ for a very poor night."

2260,"This hotel used to be called ""The Golden Tulip"" and there was nothing gold about it. We know that it was recently acquired but we wouldn't recommend it right now (April 2019). The best thing about it is its proximity to Copacabana beach but it is unclean, tired, and rather unpleasant smelling. Too bad...the rooms are ample but haven't been painted in years and we were afraid to look under the beds. Our inside room looked out to walls that were within touching distance. Upon arrival, we found the remains of the last person's digestion in the commode and a cleaning rag on the sink. We switched rooms but the next one was only slightly better.  Of the 8 hotels in which we stayed during our trip, this one was by far the worst. We don't need perfect but we do need clean and caring. …"
2261,"Good experience, all staff are really kind and helpful, the hotel is very nice, located in a quiet place away from the confusion, clean rooms and completely renewed, pretty good breakfast, good value for money,  At our arrive different rooms were available and they made us choose the one we preferred. What we saw and read on the hotel website, we found at our arrive."
2263,Tiny space and overpriced. It's a Budweiser room at a champagne price. Charged for damages i did not cause. The bed was aweful.  And the management was rude. Casey. Charged me for something because of what I threw away in my room. 
2264,"I am indebted to reviewers who helped me find this charming hotel. The staff were stellar and the atmosphere was both Parisian and homey. I have been to Paris many times so enjoyed staying in a safe, quiet neighborhood 2 minutes from the  metro (line 11), 15 minutes from the Canal Saint Martin area and 20 to the République. Many nice bistros nearby. It was chilly so the heaters at the one at the end of Rue de la Fontaine du Roi (turn left then right again after leaving the hotel) made sitting outside for coffee pleasant.  Very clean. Breakfast was on par with that I've had at other hotels in the city, although the hot beverage machine does not get the water hot enough for tea.  My bed was super comfy, shower brilliantly hot and wi-fi strong and reliable. The only shortcoming for…"
2265,"The location is good, but you couldn't go by foot to the city center. The place is very nice, secure and confortable. The prices depends of the days (work days or weekwnd days). The personal is very nice, too.               "
2268,"Hotel is located in the heart of Paris where the furthest attraction was about 40 minutes by foot! If you are happy to explore on foot then you possibly may not even need to purchase a train ticket at all.   Rooms are small but clean and comfortable. House keeping left us a piece of chocolate daily and not to mention the Hermes amenities were great! The only thing I could criticize is that the blinds in our bathroom was clearly not functioning and torn, however the hotel tried to fix this by using safety pins to try and mend the top of the roller blind. Due to this, the blinds did not roll up or down and barely functioned correctly so we had to hang towels over that window to get some privacy.  Buffet breakfast was very minimal and very small selection of items to choose from, I…"
2270,"First time in Rio, hopefully not the last one... We landed in this umpretentious hotel in front of Copacabana beach. From Tulip Inn I would have expected much more... We struggled to find a room not stinking of mould... All appearance and care was at very low level. Probably next time we will move to Ipanema or the Olympic village."
2271,"You can tell that at one time Praia Ipanema was a nice facility. Unfortunately that time was probably 1995. The common areas have been refreshed but the rooms haven't. Our room had electrical outlets hanging out by the wires, furniture eaten away by the salt air, and mis-matched furnishing stuffed in haphazardly.   The service can only be described as hostile. No matter what we asked for, the answer was an emphatic ""no!"" We felt like we were bothering the staff with our stupid requests. My wife speaks fluent Portuguese so it wasn't a language problem either. The restaurant food was bland and over-priced. The breakfast room was likewise worn and dated.  The location, on the bright side, was perfect for our needs. We walked on Ipanema every day and on to Copacabana on a couple of…"
2272,"When I arrived I was greeted by the bellboy at my taxi, who strangely ""knocked"" loudly on the glass of my door more than once for me to open the door (whilst I was in the process of paying the taxi driver)  - he was polite however clearly ""training"" on standards are needed.   Front desk was very professional - you sit down to check in which was a nice touch and the Receptionist knew her stuff and full explained everything.  My room was on the third floor overlooking the main square in Porto - beautiful room, not the most spacious - with a great view.   However the architect has clearly not used their brains in some points.  -Luggage Rack  - the most logical area available in the room to put your luggage rack is where the ""architect"" has carelessly put the main electric switch…"
2273,"I travel twice a year for busines to Cannes! I 💜 Horel America, so clean, staff and owner treat you like family!  The best service, accomodation and people in Cannes! Close to restaurant and shopping! Amazing breakfast! "
2274,"I honestly expected a lot less for the price i paid. However this really is a three star hotel in an amazing location. The reception staff is very polite and helpfull. The 100 bus stops right outside. The rooms are clean, and the bed is super comfortable. "
2275,The building itself is stunning - it has been modernised in a classy way that keeps all the charm. The blend between modern and old is perfect. Breakfast is good - all you could want. Staff are very friendly and all speak good english. Good gym with all you need for a quck holiday workout. Location is great - 5 minuses walk from all the best shops.
2276,"stayed at the hai yen resort for 3 nights. was happy overall with the stay they location and grounds were nice, rooms fairly decent and the resraunt adequate. problems arose when booking bus tickets to dalat. despite clearly saying dalat repeatedly and saying "" so 5 tickets to dalat"" once the purchase had been made we were given tickets to saigon. we realised this when one man on a moped came to pick us up. he asked if we were going to saigon which we stated we were not. he entered the front office and out came the woman who deals with the ticket booking. she refused to accept responsibility for the what we then percieved as mistake and tried to book as in for another night as there was no more buses untill the next day. when queried about the tickets she stated that we had been…"
2277,"Booked as part of weekend eurostar package. We were going to see a concert at the Bercy omnisport and the hotel is a relaxed 10 minute walk from the venue. If travelling by eurostar you arrive at Gare du Nord which is either about 10 mins in a cab or 20 mins via metro ( take line 5) and then an easy 2 min walk to the hotel. The hotel has Modern minimilist styling throughout and the staff at reception were lovely friendly and helpful. Our room was very clean with a comfy bed and good sized quality shower. The hotel has Free wifi which was useful as 3g coverage in paris seemed non existant and also offers free tea, coffee and bottled water in reception. The hotel is also only a two min walk from the main gare de lyon rail and metro which provides easy metro access to le louvre,…"
2278,"We had a horrible experience at this hotel. We booked a king through hotels.com, when we got arrived they told us they had us in a queen (they didn't say anything about our original reservation for a king) when WE brought it up they said we're out of Kings, and if we wanted a refund to go through hotels.com. The manager Kirk was INCREDIBLY rude, and basically said this isn't my problem. We heard them feeding the same line to a couple checking in later that night, they put that couple in twin beds, so I guess we were lucky. The heater in our room was broken, we have a little baby so this was sort of important they lied and said they fixed it, when it was still obviously not working. After our third call they wheeled in a space heater. The only thing good about this hotel is the…"
2279,"We were so pleasantly surprised by this hotel! Our room had a little balcony over the street, which we were not expecting but adored. The room and bathroom are tiny even by European standards, but the lobby was very chic and had coffee and candy and foosball, with a sweet little courtyard. The staff were all multilingual, young and friendly.  I would stay here again!"
2280,"This hotel is very noisy, no housekeeping (they call it “green “.... whatever...) and one person entered my room at 4AM while I was sleeping. Unbelievable.  Worst experience ever...   Very disappointing for the very expensive price"
2282,"Looking forward to my last night in SH (for this month) and thought I would try someplace new.  Ritz Carlton as a global brand should also excel in China, where brands are revered, and disappointment means failure.  Room and Exec Lounge were nice and relaxing. Overall, service from greeting at reception , to on premises Japanese restaurant average at best.   I expected more from this global icon. "
2283,"We stayed at a few different hotels in Argentina, and this was by far the worst in terms of luxury, comfort, space, and amenities.  It is in Las Canitas, which is a decent area of Palermo, but don't be fooled - it is not as nice / trendy as Palermo Hollywood, Palermo Soho, or Recoleta.  We basically stayed here because it was close to the domestic airport.  The ""upgraded"" room was TINY (you can literally barely move around the bed), the bathroom amenities consisted of very generic bottles labeled as ""shampoo,"" ""shower gel,"" etc. that seemed watered down / diluted, and the bathmats were worn and dirty.  The breakfast was ordinary (but admittedly free) and is basically some small muffins, etc. or scrambled eggs cooked by the receptionist when she can get away from her desk.  Oh,…"
2284,"I stayed there with my colleagues during a business trip. it was nice , neat and clean with good breakfast and nice warm staff. the only problem was the view of my room's window which was the opposite building , in between there was a narrow alley , so while staying in the room I had the feeling that I'm in a prison! but everything else was totally fine."
2285,After lugging your possessions from terminal to the sky train to the elevator you see the Hilton ahead of you.  You finally reach the doors and have to manually wedge them open with one suitcase to get the other one thru.  No automatic doors here.  Alas you are inside on the carpet which does nothing to assist your roller luggage move ahead.  Finally you reach the check in desk and there is a special line for the HIlton Honors ....relief...but no one here to serve the Hilton Honors guests.  Down the way the regular checkin greets about 5 check ins....Hilton Honors finally someone shows up.  You wait until it is your turn.  Then you go Forward but someone comes up yelling that he has been trying to get thru to room service for a half hour and the check in girl goes away with…
2286,"Great hotel, close to Camp Nou and metro. If your willing to travel to the city center via metro (approximately 30minutes) then it's a place to stay. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is awesome and worth the money! "
2287,"We only spent one night in hotel Jupiter and were more or less satisfied. Although the hotel is located on a main street, it was relatively quiet in the room. The city centre and the airport are easy to reach by public transport. The room (including the bathroom) was spacious and the bed comfortable. Also the internet connection was good. But there were some flaws: The sliding door into the bathroom could not be closed and it was quite cold (the heating didn't seem to work). We also found the hotel's atmosphere quite cold for a four-star hotel. With a little decoration the feel-good factor could be increased. As described in other reviews, we don't think it's right that you have to pay extra to use the indoor pool. Finally, the man at the reception had initially forgotten to…"
2288,"Stayed at Capri by Fraser Berlin for 4 nights.  Great room with comfortable bed and hotel located in excellent location.  Very close to some lovely restaurants and cafes beside the river and in the historical area near Nikolaikirchplatz.  The staff on reception were exceptionally friendly and helpful.  The only very minor criticism was that the housekeeping staff did not always replenish tea and milks, nor some toiletries but reception staff helpfully arranged for new stocks."
2289,"Recent stay at this hotel was disappointing.  The hotel was in a tourist area very close to the Yu garden; Yu garden subway station on line 10 was walkable.  There is a convenient store, ATMs, and few late night food options nearby.  While the staff attempted to help, their English was very limited and checking in was difficult.  The room was not in good condition.  Laminate flooring was cracked and peeling, bathroom sink drain was not attached and leaked all over the floor, shower was leaky, and toilet ran throughout the night.  The hallways and room smelled heavily of smoke.  During my visit there was some group utilizing hotel rooms to show goods.  During the day, and up past midnight, people were wandering the halls talking between rooms with doors open and smoking in the…"
2290,"Room - Ok, not so good but clean, tidy, and simple Food - Good with variety and quality  Spa - Ok, not too bad but not give impressive both in service facilities and therapist Swimming pool - nice  Beach - private and very good  Bar - Ok, drinks are a bit pricey Reception and Concierge -  Truely bad in service and how to handle a simple request. Need a  lot more improvement in their service and interaction (reply and help guest) ... there are so many of simple help I asked them but not accomplished or got a weird reply."
2291,"This hotel is in a beautiful, historic building. You wouldn’t even know it’s a hotel at first glance. The room we stayed in was updated, good sized, with tasteful decor and a very nice modern bathroom. As an added plus, we had a view of the Eiffel Tower! It was a distant view, but it was very pretty at night. There was air conditioning which thankfully worked great as it was hot while we were there. A French balcony allows you to get some fresh air and a nice view. There is an elevator. Staff was very helpful and pleasant. Lots of sidewalk cafes and small stores in easy walking distance. Also just a short walk to The Museum of Natural History which was excellent!  I recommend! "
2292,"To preface, my girlfriend and I are both lifetime platinum elite members with Marriott, so we’ve been around the block when it comes to traveling.  We arrived at this hotel after over 20 hours of traveling from the west coast of the US.  We arrived a little after noon and after we waited in line for 15 minutes to be checked in, with only two other couples in front of us, we were told that we had been upgraded to the Presidential Suite but that the room wasn’t ready.  The front desk staff informed us that the room would be ready in an hour.  What we should have done was just asked for the room that we booked and gotten in a quick nap before hitting the town.  What we actually did, because we were curious to see the room, was sit in the executive lounge for 2 hours waiting.  At…"
2293,"A very nice hotel in a perfect place; if you can't walk where you want to be, you take the bus, U/S (train) or tram, they're all right there! No smoking except for the bar on 6th floor (and you can really sense it around the elevators). Awesome breakfast, no need to bother with lunch most days :D but if you're after a working internet connection (wi-fi) then you might need to take a walk next to the museum for the one of the Berlin Free spots. The wi-fi at the hotel only worked the first day of our stay (3 days).. "
2294,"The hotel is modern, clean and affordable. The staff is very nice, ready to give advice on sightseeing, provide maps, sell souvenirs and so on. The location of the hotel is in the heart of Berlin, nere Alexanderplatz, with numerous restaurants, coffee shops and bars open till late (2-3 am). Free Wifi is available with codes per each device and it works with no exceptions. Breakfast is very good, not included but priced at around 6€. If you are looking for a reasonably priced, clean and nicely located accomodation - this hotel comes with my highest recommendation."
2295,"This hotel was a fair price, great location, super quiet, and really clean. I was on the top floor. Breakfast was a bit pricey for what you get. Probably wouldn't get that again. Wi-fi free in the lobby. Room has air conditioning and nice, natural light. TV only has a few channels - all pretty much in German. Staff is friendly. Iron & board available from the front desk (must leave a refundable deposit)."
2296,"Hilton in general is very consistent and reliable.  This facility was the exception.  I had to cancel my trip which I did prior to my planned arrival.  They still charged me for the room, OK, I kind of get it, although I am sure they still sold the room, since my other colleagues that were staying there said it was sold out.  Since I told them in advance, if they were able to resell the room it would be nice if they would cancel the charge, just a thought.   It would be especially appropriate for people who stay at Hilton hotels on a regular basis all over the world and have been loyal to them. They did not post the receipt online, like other properties.  When I called to try to get a receipt for the stay/non stay, the customer service group passed me around from person to…"
2298,"We recently stayed at the Furama resort villas for only one night, we were able to get a good deal for the villa. On arrival the villa had a lingering smell that I can only describe as similar to a public bathroom and the overall cleanliness of the villa was poor for a 5 star resort. When it come to getting a golf cart/buggy to the main hotel was when the fun started a 15 minute conversation with 6 or 7 staff members that could not speak or understand English to the point we ended up walking to reception. Overall really disappointed with the quality of this hotel."
2300,"Convenient location, just a stone’s throw from the Ramblas. Centrally located to get around for meetings. Bit noisy unfortunately. you can hear people in the room next door, but also a bit from outside.  Staff were very nice, at the reception, the restaurant, at breakfast too. "
2301,"This hotel is very well located with respect to major areas one would typically visit in Berlin (Museum island is a 10-15 min walk), Gendarmenmrkt is across the street, Check-point Charlie is a 10 minute walk etc. For everything else, there's a metro station out front. Especially for first time visitors, who will likely spend a lot of time in the Mite district, this hotel is well placed.   We spent three days at the Hilton and overall would say it was a pleasant experience. The room was a decent size for a hotel room in Europe; there was a decent work out area, and of course a spa; and, the lobby is well appointed. While we didn't end-up visiting the bar in the lobby we noted live music during certain times and people seemed to be enjoying themselves. The staff were friendly…"
2302,"For Brazilian standards, the place is quite pricey -- around $90.   Not the most glamorous location in Rio, and the nearest commercial plaza is a good half-hour walk.  We were unlucky that our suite did not have hot water running, but apparently that was an unfortunate coincidence.   Breakfast was all right, but probably because we were spoiled by better quality services elsewhere in this beautiful country.  Also, they have a pretty strict cancellation policy -- 7 days ahead of booking dates which is reasonable considering the place is small. Something to take into account if you are considering more flexible vacation plans."
2303,"We were a group of 4 friends who stayed at a 2 bedroom apartment of Manga Rosa during carnival 2012. I recently joined trip advisory and had to share the experience to warn people. In regards to the apartment, it was good, clean and at a great location. It was comfortable and the AC worked well, the evening front desk manager Ulysses was very helpful and genuinely nice. The main downfall was that Joe (the owner) himself and the front desk convinced us to buy tickets for a bloco (Brazilian rock/reggae) that they said they knew and had contacts with which they got cheaper tickets for compared to the rest of the blocos, and that we would be a small group, people from our hotel and a selected few others, sort of like VIP experience, but it left from the other route (not the one in…"
2304,"We stayed here for five nights.  The staff were wonderful, genuinely want to make certain you have a good trip.  Helpful with suggestions and assistance.  Easy walk to the metro station and many attrations,  Breakfast was awesome!    The room was spacious by Eurpoean standards.  I was not thrilled with the modern bathroom as it did not allow for much privacy,  Bed was comfortable and room was quite, no street noise.  Would stay here again!"
2305,"We chose this hotel based on the location. We have stayed in Sofitel hotels previously and had hoped it would be as good as the usual Sofitel experience, but we were very disappointed. The room and bathroom was small and tight. The mattress on the bed was lumpy and high in the middle. Front desk staff were very good and helpful, but may not be able to say the same with housekeeping. This property is not 5 star, more a boutique or 4 star. The lobby area always smelt of cigarette smoke as people smoke just outside the front door."
2306,"We stayed for four nights over New Year. I booked a package through BA.com for a premium room. Our room, 610, was on the 6th floor, appeared to be a refurbished room and very spacious. The bed was a super king and very comfortable. Our room had a very small Juliette balcony with a fully opening door which if you stay in summer you could leave open overnight for air. Most importantly this room was very quiet and we did not hear our neighbours at all.   The hotel's public areas are nicely maintained and we found the staff to be very polite, I emailed the hotel a few times with questions before we arrived and my emails were responded to quickly and professionally. It was also nice to see the hotel manager on New Year's day in reception speaking to the guests to check that everyone…"
2307,"This is overall a very good hotel. It is comfortable, well-appointed, and close to the subway for trips to anywhere in Berlin. The restaurant and food offerings are excellent. The staff are courteous and polite, handling any problems with ease."
2308,"It's a cool hotel and slightly different concept, like there's a watergun in the bathroom, the rooms furnishing are different from other hotels with the bed facing away from the door and you don't need to pay for an whole breakfast if you don't want to go all in (but everyone seemed to buy everything either way because it feels quite complex otherwise).  The breakfast buffet is more like a cafe with premaid sandwiches and so in. As a pescatarian (veg but eat fish) I had slightly less things to choose from when I couldn't choose what to have on my sandwich my self. The omelett was so good!   They proudly write that you can fit your case under the bed so you get some extra room. I looked under the bed, and they haven't vacuum cleaned under there for a while so that was a no go. So…"
2309,This hotel is in a great location but is NOT worthy of 4 Star rating!!! Very small rooms & needed updating. Was charged extra $35 + tax for 2 beds as we were traveling with 2 children. Company we booked with supposedly called two days prior to our arrival & it was supposedly taken care of at no charge...Wrong! Could be better amenities for what we were charged. Almost impossible to watch tv cause it's on a side wall; not in front of the bed.
2310,"Stayed here for Carnaval and was really disappointed. For the price that was paid I didn't think a very good service was provided. The rooms are tiny with three tier bunk beds, some of the staff are really rude and unhelpful, the night watchman chases couples round the hostel at night telling them they're not allowed be together cause they're not married. There are not enough toilets/showers for the amount of beds, just 5 but at one stage 2 were out of order. Also the communcal area is just a couple of leather couches in front of reception and the bar just has a few uncomrfotable picnic chairs."
2311,"Positives: •	Good location, near a shopping centre and many restaurants in the surrounding streets •	Comfortable bed •	Gym ok, although a bit dated  Negatives •	Badly needs an upgrade, décor from the mid 1990’s •	No iron available, hence I had to attend meetings with wrinkled shirts •	Staff not overly helpful •	Jacuzzi out of action. •	No coffee making facilitates in the room. •	As stated on the back of the room service menu, if it  goes missing they will charge you a “tax”  Overall Do not book this hotel if your expecting a business standard hotel, it is clearly not. The standard is  similar to a cheap 2 star hotel. I would avoid if possible."
2312,"Lovely efficient hotel, right next to an underground station.  Brilliant breakfast with gluten-free bread (you have to ask).  No gluten-free beer though.  All the staff were very polite, friendly and helpful.  The art is a bit unusual, everything seem to be hung upside down."
2313,"Great hotel in awesome neighborhood in Paris. Rooms were very clean and bilingual staff was superb!!  Many bakeries, cafes and boutique shopping nearby We will stay here again when we come back to Paris."
2314,"We've been here for 5 days & have 2 days left, the hotel complex is amazing on first impression!!  However the swimming pools are freezing cold, the Jacuzzi in the anex  to the gorgeous room is also freezing 🥶 so not been able to enjoy either!!!  What is the point of either of these features that attracts tourists in the 1st place if we can't enjoy them 🙄  So I'd have to give this hotel a 3 ⭐️ disappointing on the most important holiday level, food in the buffet is ok"
2315,"For my family from the Philippines, it was a very nice stay at your Hotel. Especially Sophie and Cora they were very efficient and accommodating. They made our stay very special. The Hotel has it all. Thank you of course as well to all the other team members.   We for sure will come back and we will tell our friends to visit you.   🍀👍"
2316,"Wasn’t sure about the his place when we first pulled, but it is a real gem, nicely updated,not ostentatious, small rooms but we were only there to sleep. Located in the middle of a couple dozen great restaurants within 5 min walk , 100 meters from a metro stop, 1 block from a major taxi , hop on hop off bus interchange, this place offers good value."
2318,"Best Area. All in walking distance. Well equipped and spaced appartments. Nice Service. Affordable restaurant at ground floor. ""comfort appartment"" category or above are a good choice.We will come back.     "
2319,"I visited Berlin with a tour group and the hotel was picked for us. That being said it was a quaint hotel. Talking with my friends no two rooms were alike. I believe I had the smallest bathroom in the hotel. Big enough to have a shower, sink and toilet. Not much additional room. No A/C, had to open the double windows to cool down the room. Room has fridge, tv, dresser, with small table and chair. Bed was comfortable with one pillow.   The hotel has an extensive breakfast buffet and the staff was wonderful. The same can be said for the front desk.   Overall, great staff, comfortable bed, and great breakfast buffet. The Pros outweighed the few cons. I would stay here again. "
2320,"Rooms are good size, though bathrooms are a quite mini... quiet, good breakfast, very friendly staff, especially at reception. Good location for S Bahn, and long walks/cycle rides into Tiergarten and off to Branderburg gate. But there is not much around here... so if you want to go and eat, you need to head off one stop to Zoologischer Garten.  You can sit outside on a warm day (as I am now) and drinks and food are good. They also rent bikes for 12 euros per day."
2321,"This is a decent place to sleep a few blocks south of the Rijksmuseum.  The Canal outside the hotel is currently under construction with a bunch of cranes as your primary view.  Rooms and beds are fine, but there are signs of aging as things like ice makers, safes, etc. don't all work.  All that said, when you have as nice a staff as they do, I tend to forget about these minor things."
2322,"We paid a lot for this as it was for New Year's Eve (somewhere near £400 a night I think), and of course it's a well-respected chain, so I expected a lot more than we got.  I'll start with the positives though.  The staff were generally very helpful and friendly (with a couple of exceptions - see below).  Wagner at breakfast was particularly welcoming, and the guys on the beach sorting our sun beds were great.  As you'd expect the room was very good quality with a large comfy bed and a great view of Copacabana beach.  However, we asked for a high floor and only got 3rd floor - of course they were booked up over this period (which may explain some of the problems), but we did book a long way in advance and they didn't mention our request with an apology - we had to raise the…"
2323,"Stayed here for 3 nights during the World Cup.  As many of the other reviews note, this place, while prominent in the area, is not close to anything else. The good news is that every taxi driver seems to know where it is, but that is probably because the place feels like it's been there since the 50s. The rooms certainly give that vibe as everything was old, from the wicker chairs to the 10in CRT television (which, by the way, had built in knock-off versions of 80s arcade games, whaaaat)  The first morning I awoke to ants on my pillow, and after consulting with the front desk, housekeeping was able to do a cleanup. The ants did not return the following few days, but the concern was still in my mind.  Still managed to get a few nights of good rest, and the view of the ocean is…"
2324,"This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The rooms are decent and the location is okay but the staff in this hotel are absolutely disgusting. The only saving grace was Harold from the front desk. He was extremely helpful and attentive to all of our needs. We had issues with managers who were completely rude to us. Freddy gave us attitude while we were asking questions about our room and what we were paying for. Then another manager named Saloman told my friend she was a liar because she was wearing contacts and said that she didn’t want any problems with him, basically threatening her. We were confronted by a bartender after we spoke about a service that was given to us. Most of the staff was rude with the exception of Juan the bartender at the lobby bar and Harold at the…"
2326,Generally all was adequate.... just not the wow factor I have come to expect from a Riu Palace. Towels Im afraid like rags. Beds uncomfortable my bed was very hard husbands soft and lumpy. Staff made the hotel very good.
2327,"This large elegant hotel is situated on the Babelplatz in a former bank. It is an imposing building in a beautiful part of Berlin. The staff are friendly and efficient. From the moment you arrive you are treated courteously and extremely well. Our room was comfortable, spacious, and very pleasant. The breakfast is excellent, and the bar staff are delightful. The design is powerful involving a lot of red, and large contemporary paintings. While this style may have been the height of fashion ten years ago, it is now dated and strident. It is very much of it's time, and somewhat self conscious. This is a minor criticism of a very well run and comfortable hotel. I highly recommend the Hotel de Rome, and enjoyed my stay immensely."
2328,"I want to start by saying that in this property there is one man and only one man you need to know, his name is Eric Liu, one of the concierge people who, if the Human Resource Department would knew his capabilities, should make him the hotel’s General Manager, seriously. I had the pleasure to meet him because one of my suitcases was delayed and knowing how the airlines operate, I decided to seek assistance from the Concierge Desk. Eric made sure I left his desk with the assurance that he would look after the process of getting that suitcase as soon as possible to my room and, he did. The next day, when I thanked him, I asked him a few tips on areas I needed to go, made dinner reservations where it is difficult to get a table, etc. You may not stay at this hotel but do make sure…"
2329,"Horrible room, don't stay at the ""Deluxe"" queen its hideous. One of my worst experiences, and it wasn't cheap. The room smelled, it had no windows (shut down window), not even in the bathroom. The room was smaller than my closet. I wouldn't go back for free. The photographer for the hotel photos did a great job of hiding the puniness of the room and other areas of the hotel."
2330,The favorable reviews are inconsistent with my experience so I feel compelled to write this review.   The couple in the room next to me were discussing personal things in a normal tone. The walls are so thin it's unbelievable that this place can be reviewed as a hotel. You can hear the bags rolling in front of the room.  The room is dirty and I feel like I need to bathe when I walked in.  This is a youth hostel.   Don't subject your family or take the time to stay here on a business trip.   The guy at the front desk was rude when I called to ask if I could move - I can change rooms if I have been in the room for a short period of time but if I used the bathroom I am stuck. No housekeeping to clean up after me. That says it all - no investment in staff means poor service. 
2331,"Hotel was just as you would expect, bit pokey , small rooms & tv , but did the job . Breakfast was ok & staff good . Was well located being close to the metro . Dinner in the restaurant was nice but the hotel was a bit dark & lacked atmosphere!"
2332,"I have been in Ibis Ostbanhof for business consideration. The hotel is honestly very clean, breakfast quality is amazing and service's great as well. I do not know if that's due to the my room being in the 6th floor but to be honnest I was very dispointed with internet Connexion. Beeing in Berlin and not able to send emails. I was in Morocco before and never faced such a problem. I could have droped an ""Excellent"" but ""very good"" is enough. I also do not understand why having booked before i was asked for a prepaiement. This make you feel like a thief ??? I tought a credit card guarantee is enough like wise all hotels around europe ..."
2333,System down. No manual back up. No communications. Room not ready at 19:30 despite 15:00 check in. Hotel unable to send text to international customers!! And prepaid. Bad things happen but hotel response hopeless G
2334,We are in San Francisco for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day only just a 2 night stay. We have stayed at this property many times. We checked in on 12/24/19 and we were given room 2540. That room appeared clean upon entering but after 20 seconds I noticed crumbs on the wood floor lots of crumbs and a few plastic clothing tags as well as crumbs on the desk chair. We called the front desk and they said they would get a new room for us so my husband went to the front desk and while he was there I lifted the toilet seat to find actual crap in the unflushed toilet. We told the front desk clerk this as well. We were given a new room #2640 this room was clean so that’s good but it appeared to be blowing cold air through the vent. We shut off the climate control for the night and  when…
2335,"The location and the building are great. I was welcomed by the usual nice and friendly girls at the airport but not picked up by the regular Mercedes but by a van instead which forced me to go to the parking area, one floor up using stairs, with my briefcase and carry on which was not that light, while the tiny and very nice receptionist was continuously trying to carry them. I was booked at a small Horizon Club suite and was upgraded to a large suite, the reception girl that greeted me at the arrival and took me to the room was very nice and efficient as all the Horizon Club staff is. Hotel car service was good during my stay until I was given a terrible and old tourist Mercedes limo, those of 2 seats facing each other. I was late so I had no alternative than taking it. The car…"
2336,"A bit off the beaten track, but very good value. Very popular, judging by the numbers at breakfast on Sunday. I had a huge room and the breakfasts were superb. Staff could not have been more helpful!."
2337,"The room was a good size, very clean and comfortable and radiator heated up quickly. The kitchen area was very useful, with enough pans and utensils and room cleaning put everything away while going over the room each day. The bathroom and room were very clean. The wardrobe was large, included a trouser press and a safe. There was a TV and information on the surrounding restaurants. There was a U-bahn station just outside the door so it was very convenient for public transport."
2338,"As a long-term SPG and Marriott Platinum member, who spends over 330 nights a year in hotels worldwide,  I was excited to use my hard earned points at the Ritz-Carlton San Francisco.  We arrived late and were treated with total disrespect from the front desk clerk who made clear that this was the Ritz-Carlton, not the Marriott, and as such we would not receive any room upgrade or club lounge access, even though it does not indicate this on their website where they promote their club lounge.  They offered access for an extra $350 per day!  I had even called the hotel in advance to check on an upgrade and club access.  The next morning, the manager was even more disrespectful than the desk clerk.    Rather than spend 5 nights in a sub-par room overlooking an alley with no club…"
2339,"I was apprehensive after seeing the earlier review about it being difficult to find with construction works and took long hard looks at google map etc. However, most of the construction work is gone and it was quite easy to find after I looked at google maps etc. Rooms were clean and I have no complaints. I stayed there for 4 nights for a workshop. Hotel reception staff were great and getting them to call a cab for me was no problem at all. It is a quiet location but overall..i would say ok."
2340,"We chose this homestay for the high ratings and so many good comments about it. The reality was totally disappointing and I want to share our experience.   The hotel is pretty dirty and no hot water in the shower. In our room we found a cigarette butt. The shower/toilet was not clean. They ask you to go barefoot inside, but the floor is not mopped for weeks. You can cook in the kitchen, but it is also pretty dirty. I am sure this homestay should have hot water, but the two mornings we took shower there was only cold water running.   The second big disadvantage is that is it too far away from the city center. It is 15 mins driving by bike! I have found no buses going to that area. Some comments say that it is far away from the noisy center. Yes, but the area is just abandoned,…"
2341,"Breakfast was better than expected, and the staff tried to be helpful. But the room was absolutely tiny! As were the towels! I suppose the only thing that made it a 3 star review was that we kept reminding ourselves its a very low budget hotel."
2342,"My favorite part: bunks with curtains. WITH CURTAINS! Excuse my extreme excitement...but I've never stayed in a hostel that allowed me to have my own privacy in a dorm; that certain level of privacy is something I don't expect when traveling, so when presented with such a luxury I was really happy. I'd shut everyone out when I got too tired and introverted, plug my phone in into my personal outlet and turn on my bunk's light and just read; it's a great environment to recharge.   The room was very clean and the linen didn't make me second guess them for bed bugs (my #1 fear when traveling). My dorm room had a huge mirror so everyone was able to fix their hair, do their makeup and such at the same time.   The showers have great water pressure and it stayed hot the entire time (I…"
2344,"On HotelsTonight they listed a room for 559 usd, and then discounted 40%. At that time 5 stars hotel, Fairmont, had a room for 449 usd. When I got to the room, a huge disappointment! The room was very small and the bathroom door was right next to the bed! Absolutely deceiving! And when I complained to the hotel staff, they absolutely showed NO intent to do anything. I had to pay additional 75 usd to get somewhat normal room. Big problem - rooms are dirty. Even phones are fool of grease! Very dirty and NOT wort the money! Very very disappointing!!"
2345,"We booked a suite, when we got there it ""looked"" clean. You could tell that they did a very lack luster job as the pillows had make up and other stains on them. They text me to ask if everything was up to my standards, I am not sure why as they didn't reply when I said it wasn't.  I went down to the front desk to express my displeasure and was shuffled to the next person as fast as they could by two different people as they didn't want to deal with my question or they had no idea.  This was a common happening with the front desk as they seemed not very organized. Don't be fooled if you get a suite with a ""whirl pool"", its just a bigger than average tub, not a whirl pool. Make sure if you drive here you have take in account the $57 parking a day. You can park across the street at…"
2346,"We stayed here is September and first reactions were what a nice hotel it looked. A well kept outdoor pool and bar is at the front and then a typical Greek building sits behind. The staff were welcoming and we got a ride form the airport (despite only emailing them late the night before) which was a nice touch. The room (pool side) was big and clean and fitted with air conditioning.   The bathroom was small and the water ran on the floor as the show curtain didn't do much........ plus if you fixed the shower into the wall holder it shot sideways. There wasn't much hot water (not a major issue given the weather). My biggest issue was the beds, which were hard as rock and didn't make for a comfortable nights sleep.   Breakfast was decent - cereal, greek yoghurt, cold meats and…"
2347,"We stayed here for five nights in May and we were very disappointed as the rating on Trip Advisor would suggest a top notch five star hotel, which to my mind this resort is not.  It is at best an average 4 star hotel which provides complimentary spa treatments.   The hotel was pretty full when we were there and the significant majority were couples under the age of 30 years.  The reception area and main bar and restaurant felt more like arriving at a budget hotel than a five star resort, with furniture that seemed more Ikea than luxurious or boutique trendy.  As part of the welcome pack, you get a naff card information  book, that feels like it is more for kids.   I can't complain about the staff's enthusiasm and they were friendly, however, they were in the main very young and…"
2348,"I was not looking for a luxury hotel but an honest business center style place to stay.  The hotel is hosted in a pretty big tower (about 28+ levels). The room are offering good space for international std with an little desk and even kitchenette in the smallest room.  But unfortunately the overall experience was dissatisfaction. The carpet are dirty. the beds are not comfortable, terrible plastic protection on the mattress. Air conditioning is noisy. Outside noise (mainly from the hotel fans) are not blocked by the old windows. bathroom are not really dirty but old.  the included buffet is offered in a burger restaurant across the street. A sad offer with product not so tasty... IN BRAZIL ?"
2349,"We only stayed for one night at Cler but it was superb! It was the end of our 2 week French vacation and I wanted a view of the Eiffel Tower to cap off our trip. We stayed on the top floor and the views our room gave were truly stunning. My husband and I drank wine and watched the tower sparkle from the bed. We didn’t experience any amenities the hotel had to offer because we were only there for 12 hours, but the hotel was very clean and modern, and the front desk staff was very accommodating with booking a taxi for us to the airport. It was in a great neighborhood as well. Highly recommend Cler Hotel! "
2350,"Although they claim it to be in the city center, that's not really true - it's about a 10-minute walk from the city center. There's a tram right across the street, though. It's easy to get there by car - however, their parking facilities are incredibly pricey: 40 euros per day!!!! We stayed in a nice, large room on the corner with a city view - but it's more of a ""river view"" than a ""city view"". However, as this hotel is very large, you're gonna find a crowd there literally every time, every day. We had to wait for our room to be ready for more than one hour; breakfast was fine, although a bit chaotic as there were so many people... But the food was nice and there were many options to choose from."
2351,"We had an awesome time at the Val Girard Hotel. We stayed for 4 nights and the room was always perfectly cleaned. Even though the room was tiny we still enjoyed it to the fullest. We even had a nice balcony view of the Eiffel Tower. Unbeatable!! Breakfast was included but never really had the chance to eat, and the days we were able to, the cook/server was very busy. I would suggest the hotel to offer some help since they can get very busy at time and when we tried to eat there were no plates or tables cleaned. He/she did what they could and I don’t blame them a bit, 1 person can’t do it all.   One problem I had was that I gave them my 4 pieces of Luggage to be put up in the luggage room. They told me to leave it by the concierge and assured me that they were going to be taken…"
2352,"Very good experience indeed of this hotel. The rooms are spacious, clean and well appointed. Staff are friendly and courteous and the breakfast is tasty with lots of choices. Location is good and easily within walking distance of major sites and attractions as well as public transport. Numerous restaurants are within easy reach too. I would have no hesitation in using this hotel again and would recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in Berlin for a few days"
2353,We stayed only one night but the hotel was good in all respects - the staff was very helpful and the location was convenient to the metro and to taking a taxi to Orly Airport. It's on a quiet side street and Uber was readily available.
2354,"If you are booking this hotel for low price, it's not even worth it. The room was very small, barely any space if you unpack your stuff even for a night's stay.   Worst was the noise coming from the adjacent rooms and the corridor. Haven't stayed in a room where each and every sound of people talking, kids playing and screaming, things being kept here and there in the adjacent rooms can be heard clearly.  "
2355,"First off I want to start off by saying maybe the reason I am on the fence is because prior to coming to Santorini my husband and I stayed at Nissaki Hotel in mykonos and wow what a hotel! Not one thing I'd change and the staff treated you like gold without the pretentious nature of a luxury 5 star hotel.   Anyways, onto West East. It's really the perfect location we thought. We rented a convertible Mini Cooper for 4 days to tour the island as we wanted. It's right in the middle of everything. Short drive to fira and oia, although walking would not be ideal from this hotel as its on a very busy main road.   The hotel is very modern and clean. The rooms are quite nice and the maid service is great. New towels at morning and night, little snacks at turn down service and the…"
2356,"I am now here for my third night at the hotel and there’s a consensus with my family: this hotel is a disaster. Pretty much anything that could go wrong with hotel service has come true.   First, it is fair to point out the pros: the beds are pretty comfy, and the continental breakfast in the club lounge is nice.   Now, the cons, which have truly negatively impacted my family’s San Francisco vacation:  - When we arrived around lunchtime we were not allowed to wait in the lobby for the rest of our family because there was an event for the hotel staff in the lobby. Instead, we had to wait in the hallway by the parking garage. They were very strict in not allowing anyone to sit on the lobby furniture... They literally had an event for themselves without taking into account that…"
2357,"I kind off don't know how to phrase this.  Other than if you can avoid it,do so  We choose the weekend when chicago was maxed out with reasonably priced hotels and we had to stay here until we could move to the silversmith(btw this is well worth staying in). So in a quick synopsis this consists of a room with the most grubbist carpet I have seen in many years, absolutely disgusting.  You can't control your own heat , cold air which always says something about a place. It asks that's you are quiet in the rules of the house, thankfully we had a noisy fan in our bathroom that blocked out people shouting outside our door I think and traffic and people using taps next door or down stairs. In essence the price is a joke for what it is.  Its shabby noisy and just vastly overpriced. …"
2358,"This hotel is in a really good location, with the old town just steps away, also the cable car, taxi rank, bus stations.  We have stayed many times in adult only hotels but never in one that is so bias to the guest that are regular visitors, ( I was not the only guest to notice either) would have thought it was in the hotels interest to gain new visitors ?! The hotel is nice and clean and the rooms have all you need , we paid extra to have higher level sea view , we were given floor one on the side, gent on reception said all our rooms have a sea view, we were disappointed, as all the guest who arrived same day but had been before had high level sea view front and side views and were able to see the ships coming in. Just a tip if you book a garden room these are on the right…"
2359,"We stayed here for three nights while we were in Paris for the Marathon. Lovely little hotel, only forty or so rooms over six floors. Handy for the Metro and lots of restaurants around. The staff were all very pleasant. The pool and sauna were great, especially after the Marathon. I thought it was good value, especially for Paris. The room was bright airy and nicely decorated, assuming they are all similar. We were in the fifth floor with views over Paris rooftops. "
2360,"Stayed here twice with work commitments and had a better experience the second time.  Location: close to the airport and a free shuttle leaves every 20 minutes which is great. Rooms: 50/50. 1st room was great on a higher floor, comfy, quiet. 2nd room was on the ground floor, a lot older loud loud fridge that kept me awake all night. Room was a bit run down. Food: ok, not a massive menu and an average breakfast at best. Service: asked for 4 beer at the bar in reception and i was given antactica fruit juice instead of beer. when i realised i tried to return the unopened cans and asked for beer and said i would pay the extra. The woman behind the counter refused point blank. I asked for the duty manager and she rudely pointed at the exit and ordered me to leave, i threw the cans…"
2361,This hotel is definitely aimed at the conference market - lots of meeting areas and only one big bar. Decent rooms and a nice walk from the Tiergarten. Good breakfast buffet available but dinner options a bit more limited.
2362,"A quick lunch on 8 May with my wife. Beautifully refined surroundings, excellent service, a quiet ambiance & thoroughly recommended. We would have liked to have stayed longer but had other engagements during the day, so had to leave early."
2363,"My partner and I stayed to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. The hotel were very accommodating letting us stores bags before and after check in, giving us ideas on where to visit whilst in Paris and leaving a lovely note with macaroons within the room. The hotel was comfortable with all facilities needed for our short break in Paris, it was clean and in a great location near the Eiffel Tower however we were also able to get around Paris easily from the hotel. Would not hesitate in visiting this hotel again   Xx"
2364,"We booked a double room three months beforehand. When we arrived there was only a twin room free. We explained that it wasn't our fault and were told that it would be an extra €20 for a double room as it was a better room. We complained and the charge was dropped. The room wasn't much better than the original one. No mini bar or aircon ) it was 30 degrees), only a 500ml bottle of water at €4.50.  On the positive side, it's right by the S-Bahn station, we were given a free drink voucher at the bar, and the breakfast is fantastic. "
2366,"The hotel was clean and in a good location and a good price. The biggest issue was that we had stand in line for 45 minutes to check in. There was only one person at the desk and after walking uphill from the train station with our bags (definitely take a cab even if it's close), it was very disheartening."
2367,"This hotel is very conveniently located in a quiet neighborhood. The rooms are well appointed, with remodeled bathrooms. Breakfast includes healthy options, but there are also many restaurants nearby. Clean, comfortable with charm. Knowledgeable and friendly staff. it is my new favorite. "
2368,Only few weeks after the grand opening I staid here for 3 days. The hotel was obviously not finished with many small things missing normally standard in Sofitel hotels. Point of main concern was the bad smell in the room (paint and lime as it is new) and the huge noise from outside as it is located next to elevated highway. 
2369,"Half an hour to 40 Minutes from main attractions, walking distance from commercial Kurfürstendamm and many nice restaurants and cafes nearby. Quiet, friendly and great staff. Second time after a lovely experience at Christmas 2018!! We shall come back"
2370,"The room was clean, bathroom nice & roomy, good selection at the breakfast buffet,  all staff were nice & professional—-  walking distance to any where you want to go...I most likely would stay there again......."
2371,"I am not a fussy traveler.  Just give me a clean, comfortable bed at a reasonable price and I'm set to go.  Unfortunately, this hotel could not even give me that.  Our party had two rooms and the mattresses were shot in both rooms.  We all kept rolling toward the sag in the middle, and no one slept well.  I could have overlooked the stinky hallway and the stains in the carpet, and even ignored the obnoxiously loud ""music"" being played in the elevators, lobby and front entrance (it sounded like a soundtrack from a porno movie) since we didn't spend much time at the hotel.  But if I can't sleep well, my trip suffers.  And I can generally sleep ANYWHERE."
2372,"I am really fond of the hotel. The rooms are nice and clean. The gym is always available and the buffet is great. The only thing which could be better is the internet connection, which is quite slow. Although it is named "
2373,"The hotel is nothing special. Well located near paulista Avenue Mercure standard or maybe a little less  Ok if you stay once in your life. But when you become a frequent business traveller, when you stay more than once per month at the same hotel, when you are a platinum member of the Accor le club this is not the best choice.  They will hardly offer what offer as benefits of the loyalty programme  Maybe the first night you'll get the complimentary bottle of water. Hardly ever an upgrade and in more than 25 checkins they've NEVER offered the welcome drink. All this amenities that are supposed to be offered when you are a ""valued guest"" by the loyalty program. I stay here because it's near to my office. but definitely if o find another option I would change As I've mentioned not…"
2374,"This was our first time in Lisbon and the first time in this hotel. The staff are very friendly and customer service is very good. However, the rooms are not of the quality we’d expect from a 4-star hotel. To be honest it is a strange hotel with hallways and decor in the rooms that gives a prison-like feel.  This is also the very first hotel of 4/5-stars that we’ve been that charges you for the water bottles placed in the room. Unless of course your a HiltonHonors member in which case they’re free.   I attach a photo of the hallway to give an impression of the hotel.   Breakfast is a little disappointing - compared with others in other cities we’ve been.   The hotel is quite a distance from the city centre so in hindsight for our purposes was not the ideal location.   Would not…"
2375,"Everything was very nice at the hotel. Impeccable room, good attention to detail, and great night staff. I had a late arrival after 1am. The gentleman that greeted me was welcoming and courteous. The location was also very convenient for me."
2376,I usually don't take to Social Media to complain but I figured after my room was broken into while sleeping I would at least get contacted by the hotel manager and Marriott Reward to at least inquire about what happened. This happened at the Chicago Marriott Downtown Magnificent Mile on May 11th. I went to bed around 2 am.  Shortly after I woke up at 7:15 am I noticed that my backpack and wallet were missing from my room.  I had placed them closer to the door when I went to bed as was checking out that morning. This occurred on Friday  May 11th.  I also noticed that my door was slightly adjar.  I immediately contacted hotel security. Upon checkout nothing was mentioned. No one bothered to ask if I needed help to get home as I live in Seattle. Left with no money I had to have a…
2379,"When I was going to use the bathtub, I found many stone or black stuff came out with the water. I asked the hotel to fix it in the afternoon. In the evening, I went back to the hotel and wanted to use the bathtub. The dirty black stuff still came out with water. I called the service line to solve the problem or provide a new room. The responding was that they can't fix it in short time and was no room available until next afternoon. I had tried to ask the hotel to fix it again, but no room available was the only answer. It was ridiculous-A huge hotel has no room available.   However, it was the middle of my stay..I have the other 3 days. I had to repack my luggage in the middle of the night, due to I had a meeting in the early morning. I report the problem in the afternoon. The…"
2380," The room was very small, in bad condition and with . The bathroom is very small and with an cheap curtain for shower. Small mirror at sink with poor lighting. The old conditioner was very noisy and positioned very close and at bed height. The results of cooling was zero! The pictures that I had seen with new and spacious rooms aren’t as I have found in hotel. Only the reception is modern and spacious. Very difficult moving in the cramped space of the room. Never found an hotel as this. Look at in my review. I thought that the price of the room around 290$ per night could be warranty of quality. It wasn’t! Look at my pics"
2381,"Stayed at the Hyland Shanghai Sofitel this week, disappointing experience from start to finish, the hotel is tired and dated, terrible air conditioning system and very lack luster service, Accor you can do better than this"
2382,"This hotel is perfectly suited in Cannes.  Just 100 meters from Le Croisette and the public beach. 10 min walk to the Baio.The atmosphere here is tranquil. Parking is free. We stayed in the executed room with terras. The breakfast buffet was perfect, including eggs and we could eat it at the terras. The service is excellent.  "
2383,"Spent 3 nights here in medio November and loved it. The room’s balcony overlooked a busy street but also one of the main attractions in Barcelona: Casa Batlló, one of the Gaudi buildings.   The room was lovely and the staff very service minded. From the hotel I walked all around the city on foot, apart from Parc Güell to where I went by taxi and returned on a bus.   If you like Gaudi this hotel is in a very good location as it’s situated close to both Casa Batlló and Casa Milá. Bus stop to/from the airport is not very far either, on Plaça de Catalunya, which is only a few blocks away.   Room Mate Anna is a modern and lovely hotel in a ditto modern and lovely city."
2385,"Loved this hotel. Beautiful 5 star hotel and experience. Staff are extremely friendly and offer a real 5* service - Wagner on reception was extremely helpful. All of the reception, bar & breakfast staff couldn’t do enough for you.  Rooms were modern, spacious & the beds were extremely comfortable.  Location was really authentic- you can get to the city centre on the metro which is outside the hotel in 15 mins..  The spa is perfect , room service fab. Overall amazing stay. Can’t wait to return. Thanks. "
2386,"Casa cool beans is a nice place, but YOU HAVE TO read the special rules of this place. If something is wrong with you, one of the owners can become very aggressive. We went with 15 years old children but there are special rules we didn't know before booking that mention children under 16 are not allowed. That became a ""war issue"". Anyway, the beds were bad (old and flat) and the shower dangerous (take care of electric shock when you move the temperature slots). We didn't enjoy."
2387,"Rooms are pretty. Suite set-up weird and obviously remodeled layout rather than thought out. Understaffed and the staff that are here do not seem like they are Four Seasons trained/quality. It does not have a personalized service Four Seasons ambiance. The proximity of the Disney resort beach and its herds of screaming kids even became obnoxious to my 9 and 10 year old's sensibilities. There's just no way around the fact that when you walk into the lobby you get the sense that you just walked into a renovated JW Mariott, which is exactly what it is."
2390,Hotel was in a very central location for exploring Lisbon. No welcome from the reception staff who were bordering on rude. On checkout they were. Rooms big and very clean but need to go for breakfast 'off peak times' as very busy and impersonal.  
2391,"This hotel has the perfect location. With great views to the ocean, wonderful gardens and pools and quietness. There is a shuttle that takes you directly to the centre, more specifically to the door of CR7 Museum. All the staff is very friendly and attentive. The only thing is it is not a family focused hotel. It is the perfect hotel for elederly people who don't enjoy children screaming or having children around. You barely hear the sound of a kid. Th decoration is very hotel... no flat screen on the rooms... the buffet is very poor and the indoor swimming pool accepts kids only from 11 to 16. When I asked why they said it was because of the elderly. Even some of the outdoor pools are banned for kids under 14 (inclusive). There are very few or better almost no activities for…"
2392,"The room had not been vacuumed. The room smelled like an entire ashtray has been dropped on the ground. The view facing the river is fantastic, but the curtains are so thin the parallel builiding's sign lights up the room the entire night. "
2393,"The hotel is very nice. It is located in good neighbourhood, near to metro station (100 meters, two metro lines), shops, brasseries. The staff is friendly. The rooms are not very big but for Paris are OK. The bathroom is big."
2394,I dropped family off with a pre paid room voucher and set off to drop hire car off.  2hours later i returned to the family sat in reception having been refused access.  I get a credit card is required but is it really necessary on a pre paid room to leave a family sat in reception like spare parts?  To add insult to injury the receptionist attitude was terrible. She is obviously related to the queen of england and working below her usual levels.  We carried our own bags to the room as we had no luggage ticket.  The room view is a wall.. onwards and upwards
2395,"This is a 2 and 1/2 star hotel during the summer, but it would likely be a four star hotel the rest of the year.  This is one of the   most difficult hotels to review.  Why you don't want to stay here in the summer is for two reasons:  First, I would rate the quality of sleep during the summer as poor. The room I wasassigned the first night was an avg of 26 degrees C, which converts to almost 79 d grees F.  Please see the ""pros'"" section for addl information.  Second, this is a hotel that appears to rely on group tous in the summer.  This results in crowded common areas, and a significant amount of group tourists wating for the very small elevators, but also, there was a good breakfast buffet.  Although overly crowded, the buffet included a chef making eggs for the guests, and…"
2396,"We had read the website closely, but still did not appreciate just how separate the 'cottage' rooms are from the main castle.  Staying in the cottage did not give one the feeling that you were in a historic building, and there aren't many spaces in the castle to enjoy sit and enjoy the fact that you are spending a lot of money for what should be a unique experience.  We did have a drink on the battlements, which was pleasant (though for a hotel in this category to serve beer in cans is somewhat down market).  Our superior cottage room was, we think, probably the only wheelchair-accessible room, a facility we didn't need.  It was therefore compromised in that it had no balcony (NB to Pousada staff, who speak excellent English on the whole, a 'balcony' does not equate to a…"
2397,It is exactly as I expected. Almost like college housing with better design. It is cheaply made. Super thin walls and floors.   Well equipped. Had everything I needed and especially appreciate having a full kitchen.   Bed not really comfortable but it did the job.   Reception was excellent. Extremely warm and helpful.   Really the issues are the noise from other guests.  A large Chinese group took over many apartments and kept their doors open so they could come and go. I had to put a stop to that quickly. People just need to be more aware of their noise.  
2399,"Never come to this place!!! The staff and customer service is terrible! We were burning up in our room with our two kids (One being a 6 week old) the entire night and they did nothing about it! My husband went down to the service desk at 2am for yet another complaint about the heat, that still has not changed since checking in to the room, after multiple attempts at adjusting the thermostat, because the heat woke up our nearly 2 year old son, and the supervisor pretty much laughed in his face. He told my husband that he could transfer us to a different room but cannot guarantee it won’t be the same! He expected us to pack up our infant daughter and toddler son at 2am and haul all of our different things to a different room and for what?! The same damn thing?! Terrible service…"
2400,"This hotel has pros and cons and although we saw some great potential we were very disappointed with our stay. Not good value for money and the only hotel in Vietnam that we weren’t impressed with.    Location- fab location right on a beach, it’s a nice beach but not private and many locals come and take over the area in front of the hotel from 3 or 4 everyday. Very quick easy walk to the night markets and along the main road within 15-20 mins you can find many restaurants and bars. We ate out most evenings and found some great food and well priced. There are spas and shops all within easy walk of the hotel which was very handy- nice not to feel isolated.    Rooms- the rooms are lovely, very big and clean with comfy beds, great bathrooms and big balconies. Recommend ocean view…"
2402,Beautiful Hotel by the Sea & Most prestigious hotel is in the area. Historic icon Carlton InterContinental Cannes is truly amazing.   Sea view rooms are great.   Great reception team and very welcoming.  And Again Duty Manager - Mr Emmanuel Bruna is the STAR of this hotel.
2403,"Apart from the location of the hotel, everything else is quite disappointing.   Air conditioning in the room did not work.  Even after getting the engineering department to look at it - only hot fan air blows out even with a 16 degree setting. Their suggested solution was to open a window instead.   Communication is a major issue as most staff have limited english abilities. Tried to request for a paid upgrade when checking in but was told that was not possible even though it was advertised as a Le Club Accor promotion at the front desk.   Requested different pillows from the pillow menu, but most were unavailable.   Overall a very disappointing experience and would rather stay at a hotel that recognises loyalty members or has better trained staff and well maintained facilities. "
2405,"Hotel adds a resort fee for ""free services"". This fee is not optional. This is a scam. See the (poor) picture please.  Several things in the room were broken. - Will not come again.  The location of the hotel is good, but there are many other choices nearby so please avoid this hotel."
2406,"I was in Berlin with my girlfriend for a course so we choose the Hotel due to proximity to the course venue! It was really a treat! The hotel has this cool funky vibe to it, the decoration is extravagant and extraordinary and the rooms are gorgeous!! Not suitable for families or for people who seek a relaxing weekend as it is very very loud!!! The only serious flaw to this hotel is their breakfast/restaurant! There is one restaurant which is also available to the public! Because of this reason there is a waiting list in the morning (!!) in order to sit down and order breakfast which for the hotel guests is not very attractive! On top of that despite the fact that everyone is extremely nice the service is also extremely slow!! There seems to be a problem with organisation i…"
2407,Clean and modern apartments. Ground floor has excellent terraces which are good for bbqs and entertaining. The property is a little outside the main area of the city but is close enough to walk and near metro stations.....
2408,"Very friendly, helpful staff. Comfortable, good sized rooms. Breakfast was very expensive but nice. Concierge was great. Would definitely stay here again. Good location for sightseeing, easy to get to main stations/elsewhere in the city. "
2409,"This hotel has an amazing view of the Aegean. It is fancy, but to the point of being stodgy. There are lots of staff members, and the restaurant staff is great, but the front desk staff was not as much. There is no beach access. The hotel is isolated, so it's a cab ride to do anything other than sit in the pool or eat in the expensive restaurant. The hotel charges for coffee in the room. The bathroom is nice looking, but the shower is odd - there's no door and no curtain so the water goes everywhere. The pool closes early and the rules seem to be enforced."
2410,"Overall the Golden Tulip Belas Artes cannot be a recommended stay option for Sao Paulo.  Although centrally located, the standards remain below what should be expected in today's competitive hospitality sector.  During a recent cold snap, the room's heating was not working sufficiently to keep the bedroom temperature at an acceptable level and the first night was spent shivering under a thin sheet before blankets were made up the following day. The in-room safe did not work properly, soundproofing between rooms poor and the shower was a disgrace of  an appliance.  Paid Wi-Fi in the room did not work but was still charged at check-out.  This property seems to be taking advantage of the outrageously high hotac charges currently prevailing in Sao Paulo and expecting to be able to…"
2411,We had my son with us and they were not able to provide a cot or even a room large enough to accommodate a cot.  There were no double rooms available.  Very disappointing and crowded hotel.  Boutique is not the right word for this hotel.  Small and not worth the money.  I’ve stayed in Chicago a ton and this was the worst value for the money ever.  And my poor son had to sleep in the corner of the room in a pile of linens that took four hours to arrive. 
2412,"My two young sons ( 6 and 8) and I stayed for a long weekend.  The location was fantastic, the room was a perfect size for the three of us and was lovely and clean with simple facilities that met all our needs. It was comfortable, cozy and clean.  I would definitely stay there again."
2413,"Couldn't cool or control temp in room temp controls. You should expect to sleep naked, with the room windows open (If you can sleep with all the noise and pollution).  Expect to pay US$20 for a soggy bowl of wonton noodles if you plan to eat in!"
2414,"We enjoyed our second visit to Madeira very much but the hotel was not quite to the standard we expected. The major pluses were that it was a small and compact hotel and the view from the outdoor restaurant is virtually unbeatable. However, the room we were in had a slightly tired feel to it (the aircon unit was noisy and probably installed by Zarko) and not as clean as we expected, the breakfasts were a major disappointment - very monotonous and lacking any originality (I am comparing this to the hotel we stayed in on our last visit). Although the staff were fairly attentive and pleasant only the cleaners seemed to be happy to be there."
2415,"Visiting Hawaii on our first trip, I was disappointed with the hotel. I had booked through my travel agent, with the request for a 2 bedroom room for my son and I. We discovered we were only given a room with 1 bed. I was abit upset when I was spoken to rudely when I requested a room with 2 beds. I was informed that I would have to pay for the upgrade, even though it was what I had organized in the first place. Then being informed that they were booked out and I would have to stay in the room I was given. Then I requested a roll bed for my son.. These are not available in this hotel. And they offered me sheets and extra blanket, but my son would have to sleep on the floor. We ended up buying a inflatable bed from a shopping center. The hotel has a old musky smell to it. And the…"
2416,"Very expensive Teeny tiny hotel rooms, the view was horrible-stairs from another building, front desk was rude and not helpful, you have to pay for everything even a cup of coffee, elevators are so small and so slow, beds suck, the list goes on. Only thing that we liked was the door man, he was very helpful. You pretty much pay for your location (not the views)."
2417,"Gorgeous setting, friendly staff, comfortable rooms, great food, but unfortunately we can't say it was worth the money. It was the smaller things that added up, such as torn towels, broken shutters on our window, some issues with transportation and other various service related issues. The staff really do make an effort, but on a five-star standard, they miss the mark. That is probably the most important thing to note: this is a nice hotel with nice people, but they are charging way too much for the level of service and amenities they provide. Part of the issue was the national strikes that paralyzed the country for the duration of the Summer and Fall. We were originally scheduled to visit Santorini in early July, but due to several issues, to include strikes which halted all…"
2419,For the price the quality of service is very bad and staff very unfriendly  deasapointed   The rooms are so so   the only good point to my opinion is the location other wise choose only this hotel when no other option
2420,"Hotel was not as it shows on website [photoshop],and they charge my VIZA card twice,hang up in my face three times  ,breakfast was baaaaddd ......the security guy was very helpful made calls for me from his own cellphone..."
2421,"I was on a business trip, and found myself with a day spare. After a quick search for a last minute hotel, I picked this. My choice was partly price, and partly location based. I was driving a box van, and despite the advantage of on site parking, I found a space within a 5 minute walk on the nearby streets, so as not to block the parking for all other clients. The welcome was warm, and inviting. The room clean, and surprisingly spacious. Breakfast in the courtyard was delightful, and the coffee divine! The hosts could not have been more welcoming, or friendly.. I echo one of the other advisers reviews, and say that the larger chains could learn a thing or two about this level of customer sevice.  Advise about local restaurants, bars and sights was freely and accuratly offered..…"
2422,"The hotel staff are very helpful, especially the restaurant and bar staff, as other reviewers have said. The hotel has clearly been renovated recently, and is very pleasant. It has a minimalist scandi-chic vibe common to recent AC Marriott renovations. The food was decent. The bathrooms are very small. The beds are very comfortable. The new TVs, with airplay, are good. The hotel is a two minute walk from a major S Bahn and U Bahn station, from which central Berlin is 15 minutes away. "
2423,"The hotel is around the corner of Rue de Lafayette, so om walking distance from the main (shopping) streets. The hotel is very nice, clean rooms with good beds and a good breakfast buffet in the morning. Very friendly staff that speaks English so no problems with communication! The street it is located on, is a small street, so not much traffic."
2424,"The apartment I stayed in was very spacious and well designed. The location was very convenient, a lot of good restaurants around and a supermarket just around the corner. The staff at brilliant apartments were also really nice and genuine. Can not wait to stay there again!"
2425,"We were immediately welcomed into this lovely property by enthusiastic, friendly front desk staff. There is a small seating area in the lobby, and a fairly large adjacent breakfast area with a high quality continental breakfast. There are several floors to this hotel, and an elevator. The halls are quiet and short, with twists and turns that (probably?) reduce overall noise. Our room was simple, but quiet, with a fantastic patio. The room also had a small safe. The bathroom was compact, requiring a pivot in and closing the door to access the shower - a large person might want to inquire about different floor plans that may be available. We loved our experience here and would certainly return!"
2426,"Second stop on my China business trip and stayed all in Hyatt hotels - Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen.  Third time I've stayed in this hotel, first was shortly after it opened and was great. Second time was 3 years ago and there were signs of service slipping (guest service requests taking forever). This time however.....very disappointing.  Had a late checkin after a delayed flight and was exhausted. I booked a club room but was not offered a club lounge checkin at reception until i insisted, wasn't offered anything to drink (which is normally standard for club lounge bookings....i stay in Hyatts frequently).  There had been a slight mix up with my company card prepayment for hotels.....All other Hyatts I stayed in were really accommodating and were able to fix the…"
2427,"Cool building, and great location, and at the time of our visit a decent price on introduction through DesignHotels.com for a standard room without breakfast. I'd recommend not paying for the breakfast and heading out into the city, as the time we tried the Butcher Social Club's breakfast it was very underwhelming and poor value (and cold), though the coffee was excellent.   The hotel favours its cool design over some basic functionality, and while a record player in the room and LP library and neat, some very basic things didn't work properly. The comfy, spacious bed in a tight space meant lots of toe-stubbing on the exposed iron footings, but the most annoying aspect was the very leaky shower. A dedicated shower cubicle with an excellent, high-pressure shower was very nice,…"
2428,"We enjoyed our stay at Melia Ria.  It was close to many places to eat and if you are so inclined, you can run in the mornings along the water.  I was there on business so the ease of getting in and out of the city helped."
2430,"Stayed here for four nights,nice clean and good location lovely swimming pool on top and great view down on the Copacabana beach,breakfast was good and plenty.Only negative was the noise from the work on the lift they were doing LOUD! Banging early morning with not apology and when we mention it to  reception  completely ignored it with a smile well trained! I say other than that, we enjoyed our stay."
2431,This hotel has rooms without windows. They are cheaper and it is clearly indicated. Don't take them. It's not worth the price reduction. Very expensive for what you get.  The ceilings are also rather low. The rest of the room is fairly standard. 
2432,"We stayed for a long weekend in a comfort room.  Spacious, clean and comfortable.  Great neighbourhood for restaurants, bars and quirky shops.  U2 underground line at the top of the road.  Would highly recommend this hotel and would return again."
2433,"Hi, I just wanted to order room service. However, on two different occasions the Chicago Hilton let me down. Basically, the tablet in my room didn’t work, so I tried calling in my order for room service, but they insisted I use the tablet. As a result, I was left hungry and out of luck. Hotel is nice, but the people suck."
2434,"I thought I would get a retro gaming machine (pinball or arcade) in the room, but it turned out only one of the gamer pads has this facility.  We got a PS4, which is nice, but the TV was very small for a game setup. Especially if you are playing from the bed.  There was no refrigerator in the room, but we got one as soon as we asked for it. Proof of great service right there!  I think the gaming bad could be made much better by providing two comfortable chairs (like bean bags), and a larger TV. Then the room would be as close to perfection as it can get for the price penta hotels are asking.  Over all top notch place to stay. I'm really happy we chose this hotel."
2435,"We spent Three nights here whilst touring Spain and Portugal. On arrival we had a long wait whilst the customer services rep tried to sort out our rooms. Finally getting the three room keys we headed up to the 14th floor with all our gear. When I tried my room access card it would not work. A maid was in the area so she let me in, only to find someone else's personnel belongings all over the room. back down to reception and another wait whilst trying to sort out this issue. Finally given another room on the 12th floor away from my travelling companions. Once sorted though the room was a good size with a huge comfy bed and stunning views over Porto. Not the cleanest room we have stayed in with the bathroom looking very tired.Located just on the outskirts of the City, easy walking…"
2436,"I was really excited to have the opportunity to stay at this hotel due to its relative newness in the San Francisco luxury lodging community.  My hopes were quickly dashed when I was informed that the Clif Energy Bar Snack placed next to the welcome gifts on the bureau actually had a $4.25 charge, and the hotel refused to remove this charge even though I pointed there was no sign or notice on the bureau warning of this charge.  To make matters worse, when I asked to speak to a manager about the situation, I was given the cold shoulder and told that when she became available she would call.  After waiting 20 minutes for this call, which was all I could afford to wait due to a full schedule of activities that afternoon,  I contacted the IHG main office who helped me resolve my…"
2437,"Stay there for 6 days. Front desk guys were really not interested in helping, lady was very nice though. $35 per day for parking. Accor Platinum status did not make ANY difference at all, no early check in or late check out(even available, they wanted to charge $20 per hour). Room is a little small but is acceptable at this price range. All in all, room is acceptable but experience was not so. Loyalty is probably not worth much here."
2438,"We picked this hotel for the great location on Michigan Ave.  The location was great but the experience was terrible!  We arrived on a Friday around noon and decided to use the valet.  Since we knew that we would have to leave for the airport around 5am on Saturday, we took only the bags we needed for the one night, leaving two suitcases in the car.  When we called the valet to check out at 4:45 Saturday morning, one of the suitcases was missing.  We were charged $60 for one night of valet and in the process, they lost a piece of luggage that contained about $1,500 worth of property.  The hotel is not taking responsibility for the loss, nor is the valet company.  Very disappointing service from Marriott!"
2439,"Great place to stay. Professional customer service. Great value for money, very close to U-Bahn(Subway station) and a bus to Berlin Tegel (TXL) airport leave from right outside the hotel.  Loved the restaurant both in the hotel and nearby. There is a Mexican restaurant round the corner, an ALDI behin the building & a departmental store too. For people travelling in-out & get to work, perfect combinations."
2440,"Quirky hotel with rather bleak outlook, being opposite dark looking office blocks reminiscent of '60s  architecture. Spotlessly clean with a great shower and in a central position for exploring Stockholm, but no basic amenities like fridge and kettle, poor air ventilation especially as windows do not even partially open. Disappointed with the breakfast experience so started to buy croissants in nearby bakeries after the first night. Thought it was going to be full of young professionals but in fact luckily people of all ages. Staff cool to the point of aloofness but perhaps this is a national characteristic."
2441,"While stuck in Barcelona due to bad weather back home, some work colleagues and I stayed here for 2 nights. Lovely staff and nice room right beside cathedral, shops and close to most attractions. Bar is very small but would definitely stay again. Reasonably priced also."
2442,Spent a hour in the sunshine with very few other people Lovely place only a small beach and man made but nice to sit in the sunshine Not sure what is would be like in the summer could be very packed??
2443,"My wife and I stayed for a long weekend and we were impressed by the welcome and the kind offer of a free pass to the spa.  The room was comfortable and had a great view over the river. However, the Wifi network in our room was so week that we could not use it at all for most of the weekend.   The breakfast was of good quality, with a variety of hot and cold food on offer.   Our checkout took a long time  and I was surprised when the member of staff behind reception started attending to another guest before he had finished serving me. The same man was then very rude to another guest who asked him a question.  It's a nice hotel, but is certainly not deserving of 5 stars.  "
2444,"Can't stress enough how happy I was upgrading to a larger room. Not quite a suite but was huge compared to the other couples room we travelled with. Never the less get the room you desire and this hotel is perfectly located in alexanderplatz. Tram stop outside hotel. 2 stops to alexanderplatz. Clean and very modern  Amazing price per night Reasonable priced bar Amazing power shower in bathroom  We had a corner ""suite"" with Windows from both sides of room adding to natural light. Book this hotel. Can't recommend enough "
2446,Motel one Amsterdam is a modern vibrant hotel that is clean and comfortable free wifi through The bedrooms are modern with lovely shower facilities and really lovely and quiet. There are several buts although the breakfast offer is good there is insufficient seating for the size of hotel and quantity of rooms making it an unpleasant experience . There is also only very light snacks of toasted sandwiches available throughout the day  Reception service is very slow and disorganised and no tea an coffee making facilities in the bedroom.
2447,"clean place, location convenient but not very nice. Swimming pool not very large. Also, as winds are often very strong, you cant always use the pool. Tv and internet didnt work at all. Also, although the place is clean, I would expect cleaning service and sheet change to be more frequent (not once in a week). But owners are very polite and really kind."
2448,"We stayed at Hotel Mathios for our Honeymoon and used it as a base to explore the amazing island of Santorini. The staff at the hotel were friendly, especially the receptionist and the restaurant staff. There were two small pools at the hotel which we found ourselves not availing of because of the hotel's proximity to a nice quiet beach on the caldera side of the island. It was also only a short scooter/ATV/car journey from the famous Red Beach.   The village of Akrotiri was nice, but very quiet. A few nearby restaurants served fabulous local food and wine, as did the restaurant in the hotel.  Our only serious issue came in the second half of the week when the owner asked to speak to us about damage to the room. This came as a surprise, and it turned out to be a couple of nicks…"
2449,"Very dissapointed with the stingy hotel management: $20/day for renting a microwave, $15/day for self parking, located so far from the hotel to encourage using the vallet for $20 and... $5 for a plain bagel!! This isn’t the Turltle Bay our family used to love: Will never come back."
2451,"All started at check- in.  We arrived 3 hours early put our bags in office.  Came back after getting something to eat to stand in line for 30 minutes because there was no one to help one person at checkin time at 3.  First given a room that was not cleaned had to go back to desk and got a room.  After inspecting it...I tried to leave early and the hotel would not let me.  So we stayed out our 3 night stay. Gross, would never go back.  Worst Holiday Inn I’ve ever stayed at!"
2452,"The marketing for this hotel is inaccurate. The rooms are suffocating and hot with no ac units. The entire place is uncomfortable and small. The hostel around the corner is much nicer and you can stay at the Marriott for less than what we had to pay. We booked the hotel within two hours of checking in and once we walked into the hotel room and knew we could not stay at this hotel due to its extremely uncomfortable and unsettling atmosphere, we kindly asked for a refund as we would be staying at a different hotel. The woman at the front desk had zero remorse and an extreme lack of empathy. She sounded like a robot exclaiming “that is our booking policy” “sorry that is our booking policy” over and over. Once I asked to speak to the manager, she put me through to a woman who was…"
2453,I will start with the good. The front desk staff was very nice and pleasant. The security detail folks were all friendly. Good location to transportation and walking around. I understand labor issues (a worker strike was occurring) so I was okay to over look somethings but others are just showing poorly run and managed. Also no heads up communication of a strike that started 2 days before my arrival. The room rates were still sky high even though there was a strike and a lot of services and amenities limited or not offered. My room was not ready which was fine so they assigned me another room. When I entered the room impact of the strike and poorly managed oversight of work being performed was very evident. I found a dirty sock on the floor between the 2 beds. There were papers…
2454,"It’s a good looking 5star hotel. Service standards though are 3.5 stars. From check in to house keeping - not the best. As someone who travels extensively across the Middle East & India, I will probably not stay there again. "
2455,"I was looking for a hotel near the Tiergarten area in Berlin for the Marathon and came across the Hotel Palace Berlin which is only a 25min walk from the start. This is an ideal base and very well appointed hotel with large spacious comfortable rooms, large bath and seperate shower. The hotel also has a very good Spa with swimming pool and Gym, Two hotel bars one for Gin lovers and a very good steak restaurant. All the staff are very friendly and always ready to help. The Hotel is in an area with plenty of other bars, cafe's and restaurants and is opposit the Berlin Zoo and Aquarium. We really enjoyed our stay here and hope you do to."
2456,"When we booked this holiday the only rooms left had a garden view, having seen the photographs we were happy with this as the view was of lovely greenery and flowers, However, on arrival things were not as expected. We walked into the reception which looked lovely but there was an overwhelming smell of smelly drains. After checking in we went to our room which was nice,it came with a small kitchen and most things you would find in any good hotel room, but the view was of trees and a public park! At 2 am I was woken by people shouting outside and dogs barking. We got up to investigate only to find a group of homeless drug addicts arguing and taking drugs!! and they were in the same area everyday & night.The hotel & local Police weren't bothered, the Police were more interested in…"
2457,"Well we never expected a hotel called Idol and a 'groovy' theme to be more than a novelty. Couldn't recommend more highly, fab staff, rooms that make you grin with great decor and design. Perfectly located. Would definately stay again!"
2458,"this was probably the best choice we made once in Berlin. It is central (5minutes stroll from Alexanderplatz), easy to find, modern, clean and well, it has a shower that looks on the bedroom which is stunning (we are building one in our house now). Great service and great place, we would definitely go back"
2459,This is good hotel at really fair price. It's not super fancy and rooms are on smaller side but very clean and fresh. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The location is good and very close to train station which is convenient. Street noise isn't overly loud but some buses make noise during day. My room also had small patio but it just looks over train station which made it useless. Overall I thought hotel was great for the price. 
2460,The staff was very rude to us and lied that the hotel was full and they don't have any free rooms as well as space to enjoy their swimming pool or beach. Later we checked and there were plenty of rooms to book. Highly NOT RECOMENDED!
2461,"There were not enough chairs at the pool or the beach. They constantly ran out of towels. They kept blaming their lack of organization on ""the holiday"" but last I checked the holiday comes once a year"
2462,We stayed here with the family bed and breakfast for 1 night before we took a cruise out of Barcelona a week ago.  We had a good size bedroom with a bath and a shower.  The bedroom was spacious but very dark as the lighting could have been better.  The beds were comfy and the sheets were good quality. The bathroom was nice and modern and bright! Breakfast was very good with plenty of choice.  Very clean everywhere and staff helpful and friendly.  Rooftop bar and pool was ideal to enjoy after our flight. A bonus! We would certainly stay here again without hesitation.  Good location and calm. 
2463,"Nice enough hotel, good setting. On check-in I was asked for a credit card. I asked if it would be debited, since my room was prepaid, and was assured not. Of course, they debited it for 500 Y immediately. Since it is a prepaid card, and I was going out to dinner at end of a trip, this was annoying. I complained the next morning and was told that the amount would immediately be unblocked. Over a week later, I am still waiting. An email to the management did not even get an acknowledgement. Shanghai has some very well run hotels - my advice is, use them."
2464,"The location of this hotel is unbeatable, every designer store is within 5-10 min walking distance. Lots of great restaurants near by. Subway is close by as well.   Room was a bit small - but still workable with our 2 large suitcases. The hotel staffs were great - every time you walk by, you always feel welcome.   The shower was a bit of a hassle as the glass panel hardly blocks the water spilling out...our bathroom floor was soaked every time we have shower - we had to request for more bathroom towels every night.   Also we sent a note to the hotel that we were in Barcelona for our honeymoon and birthday, however, the hotel didn't do any effort to recognize that. It was a little disappointing.   We were on the 3rd floor, however, once in a while we can still hear the subway…"
2465,The facilities were good and the location is okay however don't expect anything remotely similar to a reasonable rate for onsite services ie restaurant/bar/in house laundry etc We stupidly didn't check what the cost of laundry was and got charged $500AUD to wash our socks!!! complete extortion. The cost of the laundry nearly cost more than the hotel!
2466,"Booked a last minute deal with Easyjet holidays. On arrival at the hotel we were offered a superior room if we took two nights meals at €16 each for a 4 course meal. We did this,but be aware that there is a at least one fish/ seafood course so if like my partner you are not keen on fish it's a big of a waste. Could not fault the staff. Hotel is clean and we had a balcony overlooking the town. Ideal pool area..quiet. Do not be put off by the road directly above the pool area. There is minimal noise. It's a 5 minute walk down to the beach which is a stoney beach and also very quiet. Santa Cruz is a delightful little town with a handful of shops and restaurants. Bus stop to Funchal is directly across from the hotel and there are frequent buses. Breakfast is continental and cooked,…"
2467,"Beautiful communal areas and great service from the friendly and helpful  staff, but the bedroom and bath room were way below standard. The bathroom had no heating,  was tiny and very cold, had a wonky shower and was in desperate need of  modernising-- a bit more hostel than 5 star hotel. There were no rugs on the floor and only a very noisy fan heater that worked intermittently and had seen better days. (It was 11c when we were there.) The towels and robes were grey--would have once been white. Maybe it is just this one bedroom that is so poor--its number 2/Os Miais. Agree with all the other positive comments about the place."
2468,"I stayed at the Sheraton for 3 nights on a business trip, and it was quiet average.  The room is normal, nothing special, the bed was good and cozy, but the design was not uplifting or ""cool"". The bathroom design was good, but the shower gave me a hard time. The handles design to switch between the shower head and tub tap and the temperature wasn't functional. In the morning, the water could be really hot, while later in the afternoon and evening, it's only warm. water pressure was not too weak, but also not strong at all.  Not much of food variety for breakfast, and neither for lunch. I even tried to order a pizza to the room and it wasn't errr great either..  The hotel's location is good, where it was close to touristic walkable locations.  Staff were friendly, but…"
2469,"Lovely old hotel with a beautiful view from the terrace,staff very attentive,quality of afternoon tea very ordinary for the price of 33.50euros each.Much better value and quality for 10.95euros at our hotel."
2470,"With this one u get what u pay for.   It is a decent budget option; the rooms are there, clean but worn and not too far from the city centre (but not IN the city centre). The service was decent in the reception, the housekeeping staff was very friendly and accomodating. The restaurant was not so good; breakfast was fine, and the place has a nice view, but they have things on the ala carte menu that they don't have ingredients for etc.  In retrospect i'd book the accomodation again but i would not have dinner there again :)"
2471,"We stayed here for 2 nights recently as part of a package, so we really don’t know how much it cost. We were not impressed. Good points - friendly staff and a superb breakfast. Our room seemed clean. Location was reasonable. Less good points are as follows. Our door did not lock and despite several attempts by maintenance it failed to consistently lock. Our safe locked us out. This took ages to resolve as reception did not pick up the phone and the queue at reception was long and slow. Our room was not cleaned despite us coming back at 4.30pm. It never did get cleaned. Our room, at the top of the hotel, was only served by 1 elevator and this was out of order for most of our stay. Our bathroom was tired. Definitely not a 4 star hotel."
2472,The Best Western Paris Louvre Opera is very well placed. The staff are helpful and welcoming. The room good and breakfast too.  In all I really enjoyed my stay and hope to return. I would have liked to stay longer.
2474,"I was expecting a decent hotel with great service.  However, it was a total disappointment, in particular the service.  The front desk was very impolite, not to say they were not helpful.  The breakfast were unpalatable, I wondered how long did the food had been put there.  The hotel should be quite new, but obviously, poorly maintained, the key cards (both!!) did not work and you were asked (impolitely) to get back to the front desk to fix it.  The only thing I could possibly compliment is the location.  However, given the above, I am sure there are some far more better choices!"
2475,"We booked a room at Ibis for 4 people (double bed and bunks). It was very cheap and we didn't have high expectations, but there were blood splats on the carpet near the beds and toilet and on the bedside table, and a very messy patch up job in the plaster which led us to believe there must have been a violent incident in the room. When I reported this to the receptionist she couldn't have cared less and brushed it off, as though it was pretty standard at this hotel. I have stayed at other Ibis hotels and they are generally very basic but tidy and clean. The top bunk also wasn't made, which surely is a basic requirement of housekeeping to make all beds? I have worked for Accor for 2 years, and regardless of being budget or not, I highly doubt this hotel is meeting brand…"
2476,What a lovely hotel to find. Beautifully well kept and well furnished hotel. The reception staff were very helpful and the room was spacious and comfortable.  Would definitely stay again. Hotel in a good location for access to get train station and access to central Berlin. Lovely walk from the hotel through the park to the Brandenburg Tor. 
2477,Location was excellent and service was very good. Air-conditioning was noisy and caused draught. A wardrobe and some cabinet would have been nice to have ... likewise a refridgerator and a water kettle. 
2478,Anna was very helpful all the way. She is very clear and good at communication. My daughter liked her so much and we wanted to say thank you to her. She must be promoted to higher management. She booked excellent restaurants every evening with a great view of Paris. She also booked all the places to visit for the entire three days. 
2479,"The Wombat's Berlin is a very new, modern hostel only a 10-15min walk from Alexanderplatz. I stayed in 6 person, mixed dorms. The rooms were a good size for 6; 3 bunks, keycard operated lockers (big enough to fit a small-medium travel pack), ensuite, large opening windows as well as a small table and stools. The only comment would be that (same as most of Europe) air conditioners are lacking, I stayed on a week with consistent 35+ Celsius days and the small electric fan was appreciated but not exactly effective, remember this is a hostel, not a hotel, there's a reason the rooms are cheaper for singles. The location is great, less than a minutes walk from the nearest U bahn station (Rosa-Luxemburg Platz) and approximately 15 mins walk from Alexanderplatz. The surrounding area as…"
2480,"We choose this hotel due to its location. We always book an executive room and have breakfast.  The breakfast is really good and worth the money. The hotel room was clean, unlike last year when we complained as the room needed renovation and a good clean, however for an executive room it was tiny. Half the size of previous years which was disappointing. The housekeeping was really poor also. It was not done on our second day despite us letting housekeeping know that we would be out for the day so our room could be done as we left (he was on the corridor). They day that house keeping was done we had run out of toilet tissue and they didn’t refill. We had to call down for some, they knocked on the door, handed over the tissue but did not show us how to fill the dispenser which I…"
2481,"near to challiot palace, trocadero station, eiffel tower 7min walk to all. Very kind reception. (even in early morning)  A little bit small room and real  small lift but I truly enjoyed my staying. Thanks"
2482,"The room was fine. The bathroom was really nice. The staff were very friendly. The price was good. Had a drink in the bar in the evening and the atmosphere was good. Had breakfast on one occasion. The fresh omelette was excellent, otherwise the buffet was fine but not exceptional. Would certainly return to this hotel."
2483,"I’ve stayed at nomads Melbourne with a friend from the 27th - 30th of January 2018 in a 6 bed dorm (mixed). The size of the room was okay, but it smelled so much in the room and the corridors. So it wasn’t the best place to sleep. The toilets and showers weren’t clean at all, especially the toilets.  The hostel has a bar, but this one closes at 10pm... so it’s definitely not the best place to meet some people.  There is also free WiFi (poor) available only at the reception within a certain period of time. Otherwise you need to pay.  The only positive things were the rooftop of the hostel, which is pretty nice to chill out at the end of the day, and the Geographic situation of the hostel, which is pretty close to lots of things and in the middle of the CBD.  I wouldn’t recommend…"
2484,"I loved everything about this hotel, It is charming and comfortable and clean. I also love the location. It is near two metro stations and the neighborhood is quiet. There are a variety of restaurants (Italian, Chinese, Japanese restaurants, etc) and stores (grocery, pharmacy, bakery, etc) near the hotel.   The staff were also very helpful. Overall, my stay here was incredibly wonderful (I only wish though they had a laundry facility). And when I visit Paris again in the future, I would surely pick this hotel again."
2485,"This hotel is only a few minutes drive from the airport which is great. Beautiful pool and lovely service. There was a cute little balcony off our room where we could sit outside and eat. The room was close to the road and could hear a lot of road noise and people talking outside. Although the website says laundry service available, this is down the road and the hotel said they do not recommend using this due to expensive price and clothes not being cleaned properly, so I didnt feel like this should be advertised on the website if this isn't something that is recommended. We booked an airport transfer which was good, but again not recommended by the hotel as they suggested a taxi would be cheaper. We wanted to go to the beach but the bus we needed didnt arrive, so location to a…"
2486,"We stayed in a room with a pool, the room was lovely the view was amazing however it is seriously over priced. I took my 2 year old and my 3 year old and found it was very very dangerous it's not for children! If just for couples it's very very romantic. The food is over priced the minbar is extortion but there is a shop down the road. You we haft to rent a car. The bus stop is near by the staff are brilliant and again the view is stunning."
2487,"The first night the room was cold and the thermostat did not work, the personell solved but only at the second request to the reception. The second day the room was not redone. On the second night the occupants of the next room tried several times to enter our room through the communicating door. We called the reception that minimized by saying that the door wouldn't open, but I don't think they called the madmen in the next room to beg them to stop. Positive note: friendly staff."
2488,"We were very happy with our stay in August, before and during a Rick Steves tour. We found the room to be as described-a small,comfortable, clean double room with good closet space. We loved the full breakfast buffet with a wonderful variety of coffee choices and bread & pastries. The location in Prezlauer Berg (in the former East Berlin) is very accessible to public transportation with the M1/M2 tram a few yards away. The neighborhood is trendy in a family-friendly Brooklyn way, but still economical for tourists and with many fun restaurants, cafes and parks.  It's close to the Berlin Wall Memorial and Mauerpark, with a lively market on Sundays.  The staff were very friendly and helpful, going out of their way to help us plan routes via public transportation to Potsdam and…"
2490,"The hotel's location was excellent, and the staff were reallllly nice. Though we had a bit of a dark room, but that;s ok, everything else was good, comfy bed, and all made for a wheelchair access, the toilet as well, great option in that matter. The rooftop views are amazing a sunset drink there would be unforgettable. "
2491,"Stayed during MIPCOM oct 2018 and am almost inclined not to share that this hotel was excellent since I have not yet booked for next year. Surroundings a bit cheesy but the hotel itself is extremely well kept, clean and friendly."
2492,The beautiful decor and attentive staff ticked all the boxes for our mini break.   The hotel is perfectly located for exploring Berlin and with easy access to the S-Bahn. We spent three wonderful days here and loved every minute of it.
2494,"On the positive side, rooms are clean, big, good beds, friendly and professional staff, nice breakfast (good products), ... And walking distance from touristic area (let's say 25 min walk down the hill).  Isolation of rooms is very low which means that you hear conversations of next rooms.  If you don't have luck ... well ... But this is a very good value."
2496,"We had a lovely stay a Vice Versa hotel. It has a beautiful entry foyer, really quirky rooms, with UV bathroom, and butterflies and clouds painted on the ceiling. The rooms are very clean and well equipped with all the essentials – and more. There was also a Samsung smartphone left in the room for complimentary calls! Really nice touch. The front-of-house staff were always ready to help and gave us useful directions and tips. The hotel is situated with a good selection of bars and cafes nearby. Would be delighted to stay there again – in fact, I’m trying to think of an excuse to get out to Paris again, just to stay there."
2497,The hotel was located by the beach and a 15 minutes walk to the hop on hop off bus. The beds were comfy breakfast was great. Reception staff happy to help and direct you to anywhere. The housekeeping staff did a great job cleaning. Will definitely visit the hotel again.
2498,"I went alone and was on a budget. This wasn't the cheapest hostel but I still booked it because of it's location. You need to book minimum of 3 nights to be able to grab a bed here (at least that's what I had to do from where I booked). I booked a 16-bed dormitory but got a room that has 22 beds or something. Anyway, the complimentary is really nice - typical European breakfast; staffs are really nice as well and can bond (smoke/chat with) with you in your room or just at the ""lobby""; there's an event every weekend like beer pong or DJs; vending machine for drinks, chips, and cigarettes; clean toilet and bathroom (you can always call someone to clean it if it's dirty); BUT THE ROOMS ARE SO HOT, SMELLY, AND SOOOOO DISORGANIZED. It's not the hostel's administration's fault but the…"
2499,"Fantastic position, minutes from a lot of attractions, plenty of restaurants, tango shows, shops in the area. Breakfast basic and not sufficient. Staff rather ok. But the worse about was the smell in the room, like the oil based wax, that gave me headaches and insomnia. I've been told that they are not able to open the windows and to aerate the rooms, cause that is a historical building (which is surely true), and they offer me a tiny electrical so call ""air purifying""...that did absolutely nothing. It is also very noisy, which is quite normal considering the position."
2500,"Standard hotel - nothing exciting or anything special but not too bad.   Thankfully I had a room on one of the higher floors which offered great views over the city, room was very clean and spacious but the bathroom was miserable.   The bathroom is very drab, all one colour and dark (quite a miserable room), the lobby was very brightly lit and welcoming.  The room itself was fine but dark even with all the lights on, safe, place to put wet shoes when entering, balcony, small sitting area with a table, dressing table with large mirror, fridge etc  The staff were mixed some really friendly who always had a smile and a welcome when some literally didn't look up from what they were busy with.    The breakfasts are terrible (I was quite surprised to read good reviews) - small cafe…"
2501,"Great location, ideal for sightseeing and restaurants, but funky design means some practical issues. Air con - is not. Switched to heat by staff even though room was stifling! Shower leaked in all rooms, musty smell in bathroom. Fix the quirky designer issues and a great hotel."
2502,"A small hotel overall clean and friendly owing family that is clearly not hoteliers. We got the best room available at a reasonable price of 90 USD in a low season, the rooms are actually quite small, shower that even cannot get enough water to rinse the soap, room view that is surely not scenic, the good point of the place is that is quiet and you can be almost alone in all the facilities, however the next door busy hotel, is so close that the housekeeping of it can bother you with noise in the morning, the included breakfast is extremely poor with fix small set menu choice, not buffet, nor to say that the staff cannot cook an omelette and only Vietnamese coffee is available, lucky we managed to let the non speaking English service to arrange at least some instant coffee, the…"
2503,"Mercure Salvador Pituba provided me with the worst sleep quality in any stay at an Accor hotel. They gave me room 913. I turned off the air conditioning in the room before going to bed, but during the night I could hear a machine all night. In the morning, I decided to investigate, and found that there is a door in the outer wall right beside the window, concealed by the curtains. Turns out that the air conditioning for the floor is located outside, and access is through the room! Of course the door was locked. I have attached two pictures, one showing the concealed door and the other showing the external column where the machines are located.  Breakfast was below average, and the butter was in a very bad state, separating into two layers, one of them in a dark yellow.  And to…"
2504,"I would like to advise bad changes in Crowne Plaza Pan Yu lu 400. Bad surprise, they have changed TV provider and now only chineses and US channels, no more german or italian or french, what's a choice. All the week end a very weak WiFi signal, cutting connection every 10 minutes. And this morning, Monday no hot water for shower or shave during one hour. Very bad. To improve quickly otherwise, will check for another hotel."
2505,"We stayed here last week and had 2 rooms as we were a family of 8.  We messed Kostas around before we even arrived asking for a bigger room which he was very kind and accommodated us.   The hotel is one of the better value hotels on the island and I would definitely recommend this to couples as due to a lot of hotel rules it makes a quiet one, but as we had young children with us we felt uncomfortable and was forever telling them to be quiet and not to jump in pool, etc.  Also wasn't fair on the kids we did take them to the nearby water park pool most of the time just so they could make a noise and splash around.  If you go half board please check breakfast is included before you arrive as apparently this isn't always the case.  The food is good here but as a group of fussy…"
2506,"My friend and I are both steak fanatics.We must have had steaks at hundreds of restaurants in Shanghai, by far the steakhouse at this Four Seasons is amongst the most disappointing ones. I'm hoping that my review can draw the attention of the F&B manager. I believe an immediate improvement plan is at urgency.  As I stepped into this place, I realized it was a buffet restaurant. Quite obviously, the grand stand at the center used to be for food display divides the restaurant into two sections, by no means it looks even close to a steakhouse.   There was very limited choice of wines on the wine list, Australian Penfolds was the only one I recognized out of 5 options. When the waitress poured the wine for tasting, I was certain that the temperature of the wine was over 30 warmer…"
2507,"It was a comfortable stay. But next time, I will consider a space with fewer people in a room. It would be better if there was a kitchen around, at least accessible for those who wish to stay for longer periods of time. "
2508,"This is a gem of a hotel. Ideal location: central, safe and never far from nice patisserie store, creperie or restaurant. The hotel is spotlessly clean and very modern (albeit the upstairs would benefit from a little brightening). The rooms are nicely furnished and the bed is extremely comfortable. It is worth mentioning that the rooms are compact, and the shower in our room was over a bath with a high step, which may be an issue for some.   We particularly liked the coffee and tea-making facilities which were accessible and complimentary at all times. Breakfast was very fresh. The spa facilities (pool and steam room) are a real asset to the hotel; ensure you book your 45 minute slot in advance. A perfect way to unwind after a long day of sightseeing.   The staff could not have…"
2509,"Only stayed here due to a problem with the price on the BA website - got a 3 night stay for a bargain. Room (deluxe garden) was spacious and had everything I needed except a kettle, only an expresso machine, as I don't drink coffee that didn't impress me. Requested a kettle which arrived very quickly but no tea bags despite asking twice. Glad I didn't pay the full room rate!  Nevertheless a lovely hotel, in a very central location and good facilities. Lots of cafes and restaurants close by as well as designer shops. Would only return if the price was right!"
2510,"Hard beds.    Coming in to the resort, the big, front fountain pool was empty and derelict.  It made me wonder if the resort was closed.  There was no porter or greeter at the front steps when we arrived in the early afternoon.  We had to lug our suitcase, stroller, baby, etc. up 2 flights of stairs to get to the check-in counter.  No one offered to take our luggage to our room.  We had to ask, and the man took one, lightweight canvass bag that had our drinks in it, while we lugged our suitcase, baby cot, car seat, stroller, and baby.    The entire resort is full of hazards for young children.  Exposed wires, light bulbs hanging out of 4/5 lighting posts along the sidewalks, cracked pavers near the pool, broken plastic tubing for wires, rusted playground equipment, etc.  The…"
2511,"I should heeded the advice of Tamal C based on his review of this property in November 2015.  I travel frequently for work and I stay in hotels for over 300 days per year (My membership status: SPG Platinum 100, Hilton Honors Gold, Marriott Rewards Gold, Hyatt Gold Passport Platinum, Langham Voyager).   When my car pulled up in front of Twelve at Hengshan, there was no one to help me with the luggage.  This is in stark contrast to the Langham Xintiandi, which I had just moved from to try out this hotel.  Turns out to be a big mistake!  At the checkin counter, just as Tamal commented, the front desk refused to upgrade me to a suite even though I showed them on the SPG app that there were still suites available.  I have stayed at multiple St. Regis' and W Hotels and they have…"
2512,"Hotel located a short walk from Eiffel Tower and across the street from Metro.  rooms are small, but we were only there to sleep.  Lovely view of the Eiffel Tower from the room.  The metro is above ground as it passes the hotel and light sleepers may find it a bit noisy, but it did not bother us."
2513,"Our family of 4 adults (2 from Sydney, 2 from London) enjoyed 5 days at Hotel Adele & Jules. This is our second stay at the hotel - we’ve named it our family hotel in Paris!  Our stay was very comfortable, conveniently located & the staff very friendly & helpful.   We will stay again next year.  "
2514,"The staff was very friendly and the room was cleaned everyday. Pretty small rooms but it was amazing what they were able to do with the space. I would definitely recommend this place to others. If you’re looking to save some money on the hotel, this hotel is perfect."
2515,"They try and sneak in extra charges at checkout.  Where as the location of the hotel, and the feel of the hotel are excellent, Adding charges at the checkout creates a disappointing experience.  I would probably not stay at this hotel again."
2516,"I was here with family for several days and nights (not the all-inclusive package). The lobby is gorgeous, the pool is stunning (not to mention an incredible Madeira view), and the location of the hotel is excellent - a great walk (10 mins?) downhill to beautiful downtown Funchal. The gentleman who is usually at the front door was always very polite and welcoming, and the reception desk staff was always happy to order taxis for us.  The daily breakfast, which was included in our booking, was excellent, a mix of pastries, waffles, fruit, individually-made omelettes, etc.  The negative: I was very disappointed by how our room was cleaned daily by the maid. She literally made the beds and replaced towels - that was it. Dirty glasses remained on tables, nothing was tidied up, and we…"
2517,"The mandatory ""facility fee"" should be eliminated or a part of the room charge. Charging this daily fee after the fact (and making it mandatory) makes the room appear less expensive then they actually are."
2518,"**Remember to print off your booking confirmation as they wanted a copy of it. This is the first place I have been that want a copy of the email they have sent to you.**  The hotel itself is modern, the breakfast is good and the rooms are modern and big with large windows that can be opened for fresh air. I would stay here again. Check out is not until 12:00 which is great. Our flight was not until 22:00 so the hotel let us use a storage area for our bags. The hotel is located right outside the tram stop. With trams every 3-4 minutes into Alexanderplats. (Take the M5 or M6)   I would say the only negative is when you get off the tram there is a sign for Vienna House, this is not this hotel. Which we initially went into before realising.   "
2519,You enter the world of Old Paris in this charming and beautifully decorated boutique hotel.  The service is wonderful and the ambiance is unforgettable!  In a perfect location close to many small cafe's. What a delightful find.
2520,"So 1st of all the reason why this hotel is so great is the view. It's amazing....but the hotel itself not so much. VERY VERY outdated. We stayed on the 1st floor and heard every single footstep and/or movement from your upstairs neighbors. Then on the 2nd night we also got next door neighbors, the only thing that separated us was a thin wooden door between rooms, and could hear every shriek, cry and scream not to mention running around of their children. Don't get me wrong, my husband and I have 3 kids of our own, but since this was a weekend for us it wasn't pleasant hearing every single thing the kids next door we're doing. Plus the bed was horrible, so sleep was not great, and the security of the doors in the hotel are questionable. Ours looked as if it's been kicked before.…"
2521,"Stayed here for three days and found the apartment to be stylish, roomy and in a great location right next to the San't Pau metro stop. Staff were very helpful and the free breakfast at a small cafe in the next street was very welcome."
2522,"Charming hotel with a fabulous staff.  We had one of those complicated trips and communicated with the hotel before our arrival.  They were very responsive and accommodating, addressing every one of our unusual issues.  The room was very nice and the bathroom was simply luxurious. The hotel offered internet and a full breakfast.  We enjoyed the breakfast very much, the selection is large enough to please everyone.  The hotel is very close to a tram stop and only 2 stops away from Alexanderplatz.  This is a hotel in the former east and--as with so many hotels in that area--there are a few quirks: there is no air conditioning, there is no elevator, and the reception area is not open at all hours. We were able to work around the reception hours, such as flight arrival and departure…"
2523,"My wife is a diamond member of Hilton.  The level of service here was as-expected from our experience with Hilton - if you are familiar with the company, there should be no surprises here.  The location is fabulous, just outside the door one can begin walking to various sites in Berlin or hop on the U-Bahn stop just down the block for a further trek across the city."
2524,"Not a bad location, different design, looks industrial, at least the room I stayed, I felt like I was staying in factory, expecting noises from machines around. very polite and helpful reception stuff, good quality breakfast. "
2525,"The pictures make the room seem like a nice size, and it couldn't be more wrong. The room is so tight you have to walk sideways to get into the bed. (We had a room with 1 queen size bed). Everything was small and tight about the room. Thankfully, we didn't stay in the room much because we were doing so much on the island. The other down side was the SMELL! The lobby and hallways everyday had this weird moldy smell. (even though the lobby is open to the outside).  Only plus side about this hotel is how close it is to the beach and the parking lot across the street is only $1 per hour. (So don't valet!)"
2526,"I had an enjoyable weekend stay at this hotel but after checking out there were charges for room service that had been added to my bill when I did not order room service. I had to use a general Marriott accounting customer service call center to try and get someone to help me. The first time I called the customer service for help they said the charges were only ""pending"" but I could see they were actual charges. I called back two days later and had the charges removed. Overall, it was a terrible experience because it took about 25 minutes to deal with the customer service and it took two calls. The hotel did not off any additional points or compensation for bad accounting. There are many nicer hotels in the area that are better than this hotel. I won't go back."
2527,Absolutely amazing stay at this hotel. The location is brilliant just a few steps from the metro and a short stroll to the best restaurants and shops in Paris. The hotel has a unique design and the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. The rooms are spacious which is uncommon for Paris and there is a fun atmosphere the second you step into the hotel. I would stay here again and again it has absolutely everything at a great price.
2528,"The staff at this hotel is not accommodating at all. I paid in full in advance and was hit with a $300 deposit upon arrival. When I asked to speak to a manager, she was sanding there he whole time. But on her personal phone. As she spoke with me another member of the staff asked me in front of the manager, why I didn't have an extra $300. so rude!! The manager just simply laughed at the comment."
2529,"First off, the location was great. It is in the main plaza so it's easy to navigate your day trips from here. But our hallway and room smelled terrible! It just smelled stale & wet. We were so disappointed. And our room was directly in front of the pool, which made it impossible for us to leave our blinds open. So basically, we were in a humid, wet, dark cavern for our stay there. Just...don't compromise the quality of your hotel by creating as many rooms as possible just to get more money. It's not worth it."
2530,"The hotel itself is ok: the room was small but functional and the bathroom was spacious and everything was super clean. But the greatest thing about this hotel is the location, just beside a subway station. There is also a bar literally steps away, which is a pretty good feature too. I would definitely stay there again! "
2531,"I stayed 2 nights in a double room and was exceptionally happy with my choice. I booked this online 30mins before I arrived from London and when I arrived my reservation was printed and waiting for me.  All the staff speak English and the service is fast and impeccable. There are plenty of places around the hotel to eat if your looking for a local experience, of which we tried a number of them and weren't disappointed. The designer area of SAint- Honore is about a 10min walk and the champs élysées is a 20 min walk, and it's completely safe to walk at night.   There is also a supermarket 5 mins down the road if you want to enjoy some bread, cheese and wine before you venture out.   The rooms are small but that's typical of Europe and I have to say the shower was amazing! I would…"
2532,"pre-paid, walked in at 11:30pm to find out.... they have no rooms available, sorry!!! then I find out from the guy at the front desk that they do it all the time.... overbook and sell out. so... they ""walked"" me to another hotel (a nightmare of a hotel) which they paid less for then what i paid them... wait, did that make sense??? yes! thats what they did! I pre-paid $151 plus tax - they paid $139...  then I find out from the front desk lady at the ""new"" hotel that I am not the first one today!!! So..... STAY AWAY FROM THE FELIX!!!!   PS - went back today to speak to the manager which mysteriously was not there while the valet told me she was. I am not making this up!!!"
2533,"After driving on the road for over 3 hours early in the morning to beat Holiday traffic, we were very hungry for a late breakfast.   The restaurant could not serve us food at 11:00 am. This is our start to Anantara experience.   I hope it is better from here."
2534,"A nice and cosy place. The team was excellent, helpful and very flexible about check in and check out times upon entering and departure.  Air-condition was only set to heating and although winter was too hot."
2535,Rooms smelly and in need up upgrading.  Sofa stained.  Bathroom basic.  Very noisy location so sleep difficult when rich Paulistas are testing their Lamborginis at high speed at 3 pm down the empty streets... No English language TV stations. Staff friendly and helpful. Room tray not picked up even by the next morning. Location conveninent for me otherwise I would never stay here.
2537,"The Titanic Hotel is located in Mitte, so basically everything is in a walking distance. If you want to go further, just take the subway in front of the hotel.  The hotel has a huge spa area - you should really check it out!!! I had a special rate from Hotel Tonight, when I checked in the staff member seemed a bit like that he doesn't care at all because I don't pay the full price. The room itself was nice, had a good size with everything you need. Although, big minus, stains on the floor and on the bed cover. But at all a nice and clean hotel. "
2538,"Excellent location. Rooms are small, as is the norm in these old buildings. But very comfortable and we had a great view, as requested. Shower surprisingly good, linens very good as well. Bed comfortable. Noise not a problem. Breakfast was very good, with fresh croissants delivered every morning. But the staff made our stay! Everyone was patient and kind, especially Arnaud at the front desk. He helped us immensley. he is truly an asset to this hotel and we will come back here if we get to return to Paris."
2539,"Wonderfully located modern hotel with very helpful reception staff. Room was modern comfortable but had no waste bin and although tea/coffee was available guests had to PAY for milk- this is a four star hotel!  Breakfast served in an uninspiring underground room which was matched only by the uninspiring buffet. No table service at all, not even coffee. But, for a clean comfortable well located hotel in Porto then this is a good choice. Four star prices though....."
2540,"Great Valet staff, Great housekeeping, Nonexistant upgrades promoted but not available.One room smelled so moldy I had to buy a candle to freshen it up. Couldn't sit on balcony due to other guest on another floor smoking skunk weed. Breakfast room was over crowded and iced coffee machine broke during stay. evening reception was not good"
2541,"A very cute and stylish hotel. The hotel was conveniently located near the train station. Our check in was great. They walked us to our room and showed us the layout of it. Nice-sized rooms with an impeccable sense of style done in the theme of cinemas. Breakfast the next morning, although pricey, was amazing. Clean, modern and convenient. The only issue was spotty Wi-Fi in the room. Excellent hotel otherwise. I prefer staying in a well-managed themed boutique hotel like this than in a larger chain. Kudos!"
2542,"Bad smell and no cleans moquettes in both rooms- in breakfast we saw in the fruit a surprise!!! Nice people working. Beds are never well done , bad smell of powder. Lamps black so much power - dirty towels leaved in the room. "
2543,"My girlfriend and I stayed there for a romantic weekend getaway and had a very good experience. The location is great: very close to major points of interest like the Arc de triomphe and Champs Elysees or Moulin Rouge and Sacre Coeur basilica. Also perfect for shopping and dining, if you're into that. Still, the neighbourhood is quiet and safe. The staff were very helpful and always greeted us with a radiant smile. That's what really makes the hotel such a success. If I had to complain at all, I would point out that the lift is minuscule, so watch out if you have a thousand bags. Also, some of the furniture can seem a tiny bit used. Our table and nightstands had multiple scratches and tears, but they didn't take away from the pleasant, colourful, happy decor and other great…"
2544,"$20 breakfast that gives no real options. Well below average food in exchange for a pricy bill. Service was good, so... I added a 15% tip that took the cost of my breakfast to $23. I was on a business trip, my company paid the bill, but I simply skipped breakfast next day, 'cause was not worth the money."
2545,"Service at check in and check out was terrible. We asked for our wedding party gift bag for 3 days and was told it was not there. Calling the desk was always put on hold and never answered. We saw the bag behind the counter ourselves and when we asked for it they grilled us, offered no apology and could have cared less."
2546,"We stayed at this hotel for two nights.  It’s very clean, and the beds were comfortable.  Staff was personable and efficient.  The Post restaurant was very good.  The hotel is near the underground, and across from a concert venue.  The area is a bit run down.  "
2547,"My husband and i stayed at the Ohla Barcelona hotel in May 2019 with our 7 month old baby. When we arrived we were greeted by the concierge and directed to the 1st floor to check in. We took the lift and as the doors opened the reception reminded us of a spa rather than a hotel as it was very dimly lit and consisted of a desk with 2 chairs facing it. - we found this quite strange. The girls on reception were polite and courteous, however very young and in our opinion maybe a little inexperienced for this customer facing role. We were provided with cool hand towels to freshen up and ushered to our room. We had booked an upgraded junior suite to ensure we had a bath for our young son to enjoy. We were in room 611. We had also requested a cot to be made available for our stay and…"
2548,it was double strand experience in this hotel between great property lake view quite place and rood stiff staff at reception last thing you cant imagine you did acheck out and you have a dollar for payment they insist to pay i euro the are so rood that they get no Chang in this fare away hotel we try the visa card of near by tourist to solve the problem other wise we will gate late to our flight or to face the unknown is there is hotel in the world not accept dollar this is unique for this hotel .also one afternoon we take tea fro reception desk were one of the staff shout loudly it is not for you it is just a cup of tea????
2549,"An extremely beautiful property which is elegantly decorated and In a convenient location.  Staff were very friendly, however, we did feel there were several service lapses for a hotel of this quality.  Our bags took more than 20 minutes to be delivered (most bags, except one which they forgot and was brought up in 30 minutes or so).  When calling several times from the room I was on hold for 5 minutes, and no one answered the phone (tried 3-4 times), so I had to finally go down to the reception.  Also, when we returned at 3:30pm from a day of walking around the city we found that our room had not been made up, despite the ""make up my room"" light being left on.  Every time I raised these issues the manager in charge seemed to offer up a reason...it was very busy and bell boy…"
2550,"Walking distance from the metro, it was a very nice hotel. The staff was friendly, the room comfortable, clean and nicely decorated. I just found the bathroom a bit small, maybe a shower instead of a bathtube might have been more convenient. "
2551,"Very disappointed...their rooms look nowhere near the pix on their website...knew I was in for disappointment when I entered the front door...chipped paint, dirty and tired....staff really could care less about accommodating....though near Union Square...not really Union Square...within 5 minutes of leaving hotel, solicited by beggars and hookers.......mind you.....the room was not cheap ($400/ night)......really disappointed....never again"
2552,"This was my first time in Paris. Thanks to Caroline the  best employer on this hotel I find Paris very interesting. She help me with location,restaurants hair salon, best places to go. Anyway this place is just magical like the french culture."
2553,It's an interesting place. Staff are nice. Bed hard. Right next door to a club so you can hear the music go on into the night.  Outside communal area attractive and nice. Room clean and nicely decorated.  Not too helpful with booking transport. Didn't see any other guests. 
2554,I’ve been wanting to stay at the Arena for at least 10 or 15 years since seeing an article about it in a design magazine ( probably something wanky like Wallpaper) and thought it would be a nice luxurious environment to relax in especially if the weather turned bad.   Upon arrival we were asked to pay upfront - it almost felt as though they didn’t trust us. I tried to explain that my salary was going in to my account the next day so it would suit me better to pay then but I was told we had to pay in full on arrival. Not a good start.   Then the rooms. If you go based on photos online you would expect a lovely designer / boutique style room but my companions room felt quite tired and in need of redecoration - also she had no free toiletries provided - just hand soap fixed to the…
2555,"$200 bucks for one night in this tired and outdated motel. Bed was very hard and uncomfortable, the air cooling system was a joke. There was a huge wet spot on the carpet between the  credenza and the foot of the bed ( the walkway to the bathroom) Do not waste your money here if you can help it. Live and learn. Hubby and I should have reserved a room somewhere further out from the Golden Gate Bridge area and had a nicer quality room for the dollars we spent. Idea was to be in the Golden gate bridge proximity to spend the next full day there. Horrible room. Musty."
2557,"We recently stayed here and Sabine was a wonderful hostess . Our room was lovely , spacious ,well decorated & spotless!! We had breakfast with other guests and it was just wonderful . The breakfast was beautifully presented and we likened it to 'Babette's feast'. We joined other guests and their company was wonderful , stimulating and memorable . Sabine could not do enough to help and was a delight ! We will definitely recommend to friends ."
2558,"Hotel is very well situated for all I need to do. Taxis quickly available, Train station close to the front door that takes you anywhere in Berlin. One stop away from major shopping area and underground. With magnificent gardens (Tiergarten) you have a vast area to walk in and history is all around you. The buffet lunch is excellent for the price and the hotel offers a great system of giving you 150 Accor points if you don't need your room serviced daily. Have stayed here before and will continue to book at this hotel when in Berlin."
2559,"If it didn't have a noisy air conditioning and breakfast was more informative for non-Germans, I would give 5. As a vegetarian I had difficulty in having breakfast because there were not enough tags. In fact those few tags were in German. It would be better that the reception was more hotel like because when I first entered, I hesitated if it is a hotel or an apartment. But the room was so nicely decorated that I would  prefer to stay again. I saw a card about an option of not having room cleaned and towels to be changed, then mini bar will be free but as it was not at a very visible place and German side was up, I recognized on my third day, so I did not use that option. I stayed in a ""business"" type single bed room, it was cosy, unlike many single bed rooms"
2560,"Where do we even begin. My wife and I visited Miami for our honeymoon and booked 4 nights at Shelborne. Upon arrival we were assisted by Shanda,who rudely told us we were there earlier then check in time which we were aware of. We had to carry our own luggage in as no Porter wanted to assist us.  We stayed in a city view room,the room was dusty,the carpet was stained and filthy and there was a cokcroach running in the bathroom draw.later that evening we woke up itching and had to call housekeeping to change the sheets.  The manager did move us to another room but not much better still very dusty and the carpets were dirty again.  Upon check out we were in a similar situation as the porters made us carry our own bags out and into the car   This hotel is definitely not 4 star we…"
2561,"I stayed for my birthday trip in September.  The rooms are small but clean and comfortable.  You can't go wrong with this hotel!  Mr. Renato, who works at the front desk is the absolute best, he helped with any\all questions with a smile every time.  The train station is across the street, and there's plenty of restaurants and shopping places within walking distance.  The only negative is that there's no complimentary breakfast, what they have you must pay extra.  I also purchased some of my attraction tickets at the front desk."
2562,"Loved this hotel. We lived in Paris for many years and know how bad and expensive some hotels can be. This one is inexpensive and fabulous. Congratulations to the interior designer. The bathroom/shower was wonderful!. And the room was surprisingly spacious for Paris. Loved the coffee lounge another plus in a space hungry Paris. I like this neighbourhood, its well communicated and not too full of tourists."
2564,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay at the 1K Paris. The room was very comfortable, great size, quiet, with a great bathroom.  Just a warning that there isn't a door between the bathroom and bedroom; not a problem for single travelers.  Mini bar, coffee maker, fridge, very comfortable bed, plenty of storage/closet space, towel warmers, bathtub and shower, very pleasant and friendly staff at front desk and in housekeeping.Great value for the money in Central Paris.  Metro access is just 200 feet from the hotel.  I would definitely stay here again in the future."
2566,"We won't be staying here again! BEWARE!!!!! EVERYTHING in the room's worn out and beat up it's absolutely NOT worth the money we paid for the 4 days in a suite. The wallpaper was peeling in areas, the ""complimentary shower/bathroom products"" were used, all but one were less then half full. The refrigerator was broken and it was replaced quickly.  The appearance of it was beat up, the door wouldn't shut completely we had to rig it to keep it shut. Then the phone wouldn't work to reach room service, the front desk or housekeeping. I had to use my cellphone to order room service then was transferred three times to the restaurant in the hotel that isn't part of room service. We placed the room service tray in the hallway that night and it still hadn't been removed the following day…"
2567,"Along the main street of passag de gracia, with lots of branded goods. The apartment entrance is just next to Fendi. And diagonally across Casa Mila. T the beds are comfortable. The main toilet attached to the main bedroom is pretty but not practical. There's no door to conceal from the bedroom. The shower head is placed low to the bathtub so you have to squat or sit down to use the shower. Cos if you stand up to do so, water spattered all over the bath area. Apartment equipped with kitchen and washer dryer but there's no instruction manuals and you will need to figure out how to use them. Couldn't make use of the washer dryer at all.  Try going up to the top floor with the small pool for the view.  Couldn't make use of the pools as it's pretty chilly when we were there. …"
2569,"Estrada Monumental splits in high and lower. We had to ask around, because the GPS  gives you the location 15 km away on a vacant lot! I had book through Expedia a T1 with sea overview. we were given initially one with a partial view. I declined and then we were given a studio on the third floor - room 308; right above the hotel entrance - newly renovated with Ikea kitchen furniture. Not what I paid, but at least was new. We stayed for 10 days but no cleaning was done. Just the beds and fresh towels. The gym was full of new furniture - not operational."
2570,"Holiday and 3 Day Weekends Never Again  Families stay away, this hotel now caters to the adults that must re-live one more drunken college weekend!!!  I am a very loyal Marriott business traveler (Platinum Elite) and additionally my wife and I have always enjoyed staying here. The hotel has a fabulous pool and the ambiance in the lobby is fun.   A few things the Hotel Management MUST reconsider: 1. Coach your pool security to show civility and understanding when ""inspecting"" your guests. On one morning I was walking into the pool to get the room key from my wife only to be questioned and almost not granted access. The fact that I was sweating profusely wasn't a clue?I had the wrist band but made a mistake trying to walk in drinking a bottle of water....at 9am!!!  2. Time for the…"
2571,"We asked for assistance from housekeeping, the owner/mgr. came out yelling and screaming at us for talking to the housekeeper.  Also hassled us about the use of the handicap parking even though we have handicap plates.  On another day came back in the late afternoon and the room still had not been cleaned.  Housekeeping refused to clean it until we made an issue of it.  Then owner/mgr. hassled us again.  With extensive traveling that we have done, we have never, never been so poorly treated and insulted.  With family in the area this would have been an ideal place for us and other family members to stay but now have certainly lost our business."
2572,"Beds are Hard,  very noisy because of the Renovations also need to upgrade the TVs in the room. Need to double glaze the windows on the rooms facing Flinder Street very noisy. Will stay again but  towards the rear of the hotel."
2573,"I'm not in the habit of leaving less than complimentary comments about services however, I feel no option but to, given we have offered the owners of this hotel every opportunity to respond to our comments.  To date (a month after our visit), they have still chosen not to respond. Not even an acknowledgement of very reasonable points which made our stay very, very uncomfortable.     A potted history of what we experienced is below with some really good feedback as well as the more negative issues we experienced:  The hotel is in a reasonable district and is comfortable, with some good staff.   However the owners (as we were advised by a staff member) used the lounge like their living room. On our first night my husband and I went to the bar for a drink (we are as far as I know…"
2574,"It’s located very close to the historical center of Paris . One can walk to most of the historical monuments on foot. It’s clean , cozy, quite, very well decorated, modern. The staff is kind . It’s recommended for a comfortable stay in Paris ."
2575,"Accessibility:  Quite simple, straight from the U-bahn, a few steps away and you are there.  Area has alot of small restaurants around and a few bars which makes it quite a nice area.  Hotel room: Its a simple room with a tv, bed was comfortable and clean room.  Bathroom was clean and tidy, no extras in the room.   I had a bottle of water which costs 4,50 which is really quite high for something thats only 1 litre for such a cheap hotel.  Breakfast: Delicious, a few meats and cheese but things such as tomatoes were fresh and tasted good.  Fruit was nice, coffee was actually one of the better ones I have had in hotels.    Staff: I found the staff very pleasant and friendly, they were helpful especially at breakfast and reception which was a nice surprise.  I found them to be very…"
2576,"From the beginning I had problems. Was told my reservation was canceled as  I tried checking in (I didn't cancel). Room smelled bad, like mildew or mold.   Breakfast was terrible. I'm a diamond member and got it for free but they normally charge about $25 for the buffet. I wouldn't pay a dollar for it....it was a THAT bad. Hairs in the bacon 1 morning. Soupy pre cooked eggs. Toaster didn't work. Stale rubbery pancakes..  Had to wait over an hour for towels at the beach.  I do appreciate a manager waiving my resort fees for the stay but I just can't recommend this hotel. Service was not on par with the Hilton brand. Stay elsewhere!"
2577,"Just be ready for $60+ parking a day.  My room was about $86 a night before taxes, but got charged $60+ a night for parking.  They only have one guy getting cars so it's a long wait too.  Never paid that price for parking anywhere."
2579,"Clean and well kept room. Near to a lot of restaurants, can also get halal food nearby. Hugely good. Helpful sraff at reception.Though expensive for food, 'complimentary' water bottle in room cost €3.90!"
2580,"On the river with clean modern rooms and friendly staff. However it’s not close to the center of action if you’re a tourist wanting to be close the sights and restaurants, and it’s a 20 min walk to get there or you can take a tram or bus.  It’s a business hotel without much atmosphere, so it depends on your needs. "
2581,We had a very small room with a very small double bed at the corner on the 2nd floor. Bus and tramway station were in the front of the window which was quite noisy. All in all too expensive for what we got. Maybe it's better to have a hotel a bit outside of the historic center. Lisbon is not that big and taxis are not too expensive.
2582,"Good stay, good room. Some old sheets was less expected from a ""Hilton"" brand. Breakfast ok, i stayed 3 weeks later in another hotel not from hilton, also 4 stars and breakfast was a level higher. Bit dissappointed but hotel was overall ok"
2584,"Great staff - incredibly friendly, helpful and professional. The hotel is trendy and stylish and the room was clean and comfortable.  Convenient location. Short walk to Zoo Station for the bus to and from Tegel. The breakfast buffet was fine, too.  Good all-round experience."
2585,"Hotel locate in the centre of city, u can see nice view of Dragon bridge from the rooftop of swimming pool.  We booked room with city view but there is only small window that u can see the view. The room and bathroom is clean but small. When we enter the room was really warm...the room doesn’t have enough ventilation and very stuffy. The air conditioner make so noisy. I can’t sleep whole night. Yesterday, we arrived at hotel early morning around 10 am. It’s seem the reception doesn’t believe that we made reservation in that hotel coz our backpacker outfit (don’t judge ppl with their outfit, pls). He asked our credit card directly n pay the room in check-in time meanwhile the room was not ready. Normally for the payment is in the check-out time. They inform us only the breakfast time. Further there is information folder that we have to took pic and read it ourself. Generally the staff is not really friendly. We have been twice to rooftop bar at swimming pool and order drink with open bill to our room. They charged twice of tax&service which I guess not make sense (I work in the hotel as well but we charge any service only one time with open bill). The breakfast was good buffet but not really taste good. I wrote here about my experience in this hotel. I don’t recommend this hotel qua room, staff, service n also not valuable for money. There are a lot of hotel, I guess better this hotel. …"
2586,Lobby looks ok Check in and check out takes ages and the attendees are rude and non helpful and extremely understaffed  the room decor is old and dilapidated need an upgrade immediately! Concierge are great! I would  not recommend this hotel to a friend!
2589,This probably could have been a nice stay but they overbooked and cancelled the reservation I made months ago the night before I was set to arrive. Ridiculous. Don't book unless you want to be on the phone trying to find another hotel the night before you arrive. Worst. Service. Ever. Thank you very much.
2590,"Room was extremely hot with a mold smell, (and not because San Fran weather is cool, it was 17c outside and our room was still deadly hot). Breakfast food was mediocre, no fruit, no vegan options and no effort to accommodate, surprisingly since it is San Francisco. Bread crumbs under the bed and 100-year old dust on the windows. Never again. "
2592,"I usually have a great experience at Marriott hotels, especially JW Marriott hotels. But this hotel did not deliver what is expected of the brand and for the cost.  I was placed in a tiny room close the the elevator. It was very noisy. I could hear people walking by to the elevator plus the person next door. They did not ask if I wanted breakfast or any other amenities the hotel offers."
2593,"The room was fine for value (a little bit of a tired hotel in need of an upgrade).  But we experienced the worst customer service upon check out.  We left our bags downstairs as we wandered the city for a bit more for the afternoon.  When we came back, we noticed that our bag handle did not work. They had stacked all of our other heavier bags across the extended handle, which bent the handle out of shape, and it no longer rolled properly.   When we mentioned it to the staff, they said the ""bag rolled fine to me"", and did not offer any sort of apology or service recovery.   Very frustrating experience!"
2594,"One big catastrofa...totally bad..never more. ...not clean, poor breakfast, we didnt feel save there.. I dont know how is possible that so bad hotel still exists in this age. Big dissapointment for me and for my friends also."
2596,"Excellent hotel! Super attentive and helpful staff at the front desk. Rooms great! Breakfast super. Great location for the Tiergarten, Zoo and shopping on Tauentzienstrasse. Looking forward to coming back again in the near future!"
2597,"Stayed at the Indigo for four nights.  The room was small, but clean.  The bed was two twin beds pushed together with two individual comforters.  The room had a minibar refrigerator that isn't very cold.  The Tassimo coffee/tea machine is annoying because you can't make hot water to brew your own beverage and the tea selection provided for the machine weren't great.  And there was a very uncomfortable side chair that may have been better as a modern art piece.   The location is fairly convenient since it is near the zoo underground station, but it is not close to tourist attractions (a bonus for us).  There is a basic grocery store and small mall nearby.  The gym has one multi-exercise machine, a few weights, and a couple of cardio machines.  It is very dark though, so don't…"
2598,"Only had one night here as We were visiting a relative who is in a nearby Hospital, and to be honest it was the only room left in all the Hotels in this area that We wanted. Check in was easy, with friendly Staff explaining all the facilities etc, Rooms were as many described, small, but clean, comfortable beds, Tea and Coffee etc. We didn't make use of breakfast, which was an extra 10 euros per person, and sounded nice, lots of local Cafes etc, easily walkable. Will stay there again, when We return."
2599,My stay at this hotel was awful.   The front desk is chaotic and understaffed.  The staff seem like they are in constant combat without proper training and a computer system that is often not working causing them to use paper and pencil. My reservation for an Executive King was lost so I was given an ancient double.  The room was OK.  The bathroom was so poorly laid out that I couldn't even comfortably sit on the toilet - since two rolls of toilet paper were jabbing into my side.   The i-pad with the room service didn't work - no one could fix it.  They sent a paper copy out the menu to my room.  I never got a final bill to reconcile.  Awful in all regards.   The lobby is beautiful - well worth a visit but don't check-in.
2600,"1) Poorly-trained breakfast staff - Serving tea in a coffee cup - Serving tea 1/3 full in a coffee cup and gave the reason that they ran out of hot water  2) Inflexibility - Could NOT issue receipt a day before checkout to ensure speedy check-out the next day - Had to wait for 40+ minutes and debate to get this issue solved, unlike other Hilton hotels I have stayed.  3) Poor Front Lobby Management - Other guests' bags and luggage on seats in front Duty Manager's desk - No space for guests with relevant issues to sit down  4) ""Lying"" to cover up mistake instead of apologizing sincerely - Sending newspaper in a language that is NOT my preference - And told me that my nationality is registered as ""China"" when they replaced the newspaper in my preferred language. - They had my…"
2601,"Today I arrived at this hotel after flying from a Hawaii work trip.  I booked one night at this hotel using my Hilton Honors points back in January.  At the same time, I booked three additional nights.  When I arrived at the hotel around 5:00 pm, the two men at the front desk informed me my reservation for this evening had been cancelled because the credit card I booked the room with had expired.  They claimed to have contacted me by email and phone sometime today but since I was on an airplane all day, I couldn't get to those messages.  When I complained to the manager, all he kept saying was ""I apologize."" None of them had a clue I had three additional nights booked.  I called The Witt located one block away, got wonderful help from the front desk and got a room at their…"
2602,"I stayed in the private room named Reserve, which is booked directly from their website, not under HI hostel. To my surprise I found the room with a strong smoke smell and instead of being offered a replacement at no additional cost, I was offered an ""upgrade"" therefore required to pay more. I decided to stay in the room hoping the ""thorough"" cleaning could remove most of the smell. The A/C helps reduce the smell, however according to the hostel rules they are electrically active from 10pm to 8am. Another annoying issue is the presence of lots, lots, of mosquitos (aedes aegypti) . They are everywhere in the premises, inside the room, in the coffee area, by the pool, in the reception, and so on. It's true this is an issue in the whole region, but there are no provisions to minimize it with electrical traps or similar devices. Everyone is exposed to the risk, you are left on your own. I noticed there is an effort to keep the hostel nice and clean, however from my observations the way these two items alone are managed give clear signals of the limitation and preparedness of the hostel's administration to take care of guests with more responsibility on health issues.…"
2603,"Rooms not designed to be used by people.  Shower floods entire bathroom.  Very noisy from rooms above, street noise, and kids in hallways.  Room safe did not have a lock on it.  No place for more than one suitcase.  Not enough electrical outlets.  WiFi went on and off.  If not for staying with family group I would have moved out after one night.  Friendly, limited-English staff and good a/c."
2604,"On our way back to our hotel we decided to go for a quick drink before calling it a night! We have always walked past this hotel and I’ve always been interested in trying out their rooftop bar! Upon entering the hotel we asked the door host if it was okay for non guest to use the rooftop bar and he happily told us we could use it and showed us the way up, which was a relief as I thought they’d be a little bit intimidating or snotty but that definitely wasn’t the case at all, we even had a laugh upon conversation :) the staff at the rooftop bar were very attentive and staff that was walking by too always had a smile on their faces which makes them approachable :) the cocktails were delicious! And loved the olives and nuts that came with the drinks too! That was a bonus for me :)…"
2605,"Friendly staff, outstanding location with access to Notre Dame and also across the street from the Latin quarter. Quick checkin and also great help booking a transfer for the airport when we were leaving for our next destination. "
2606,"5 business visits to Cannes, and 3 times out of 5 at Cezanne Hotel. Small, quite, and clean, with a great breakfast. 10 minutes slow walk to la Croisette, surrounded by nice restaurants, and very helpful staff. Will be back. "
2607,"This hotel is gorgeous and the owners definitely paid attention to detail when creating all the rooms.  Each room is rustic and unique.  The beds are comfortable, the bathroom is roomy and beautifully decorated.  It contains high end hair dryers and toiletries.  The hotel is centrally located and about a ten minute walk to Central Station.  The breakfast was excellent and the staff was very friendly and professional, specifically Lutizia and Puck.  The cons of this hotel is the noise.  And unfortunately, it's significant.  I understand my friend and I chose to stay in a centrally located hotel, but I travel often and most centrally located hotels have some soundproofing.  This hotel appears to have none.   I unknowingly booked The Woodworker room.  When you choose a room in…"
2608,"This hotel has a great location if you want to stay out of the madness of central Amsterdam . Check-in was a bit disappointing with just one receptionist talking on a phone while the queue grew. Eventually another receptionist arrived to help. She advised us that although it was 2pm and a room was ready for us we couldn’t have it until 3pm as we weren’t IHG Rewards members. However we could get the room if we filled out an application form. From a basic customer service standpoint this is shockingly disappointing from such a big company The room was fine but the mattress was very soft and not great quality. The shower was good.  Breakfast was also good with usual choice of cereal, cold cuts etc. After breakfast at 9am we went back to our room but the keycard would not work.  The…"
2610,"Our flight from Lima landed at 5am and our next flight to Johannesburg was only departing at 6pm.  We had no desire to sit in the airport, so prior to departure we booked 2 hotel rooms for the 4 of us and a day tour of Sao Paulo.  Our tour guide and minivan collected us and drove us to this hotel.  You will see from prior reviews that I do like a certain minimum standard.  In my home country 4 stars is more than sufficient, and quite luxurious.  Apparently in Brazil 4 stars is a school dormitory.  We received out room keys and proceeded to our rooms.  Upon entering the room and being greeted with acres and acres of white my comment to my business partner was something along the lines of ""is this a school dorm room or a minimum security prison?"" Not a carpet in sight, so you are greeted with very cold floors.  2 twin beds, on wheels.  In the large bathroom were towels that have last seen fluff on them around about the time the Amazon rain-forest still had all her trees.  Put it this way, if my travel agent had booked me into this room for any longer than it took us to shower, change and leave on our day tour, I would have been on the phone to her to have us moved to a better location.  In the end it served its purpose.  We showered in hot water, changed into clean clothes and went down for a pretty good breakfast.  Would I stay there if I were visiting Sao Paulo again?  Sadly, dear reader, the answer is no.…"
2611,"So we stayed for 4 nights in this hotel. Room was nice, but not really big. With cleaning and services everything was good. Location is also great, really close to Potsdamerplatz. Our room was on 6th floor, so was hot sometimes, needed to open window always. Conclusion: everything nice and I would recommend to stay in this hotel, but I can't say that it's the best place for romantic couple staying."
2612,"Trams outside the door take you everywhere, room / ordinary but the price reflects that, helpful friendly staff, great little Italian restaurant 300m away (casa de Michael).   Not sure if you’ll find better value in the city as the whole place is massively overpriced and just a tourist trap, my advice is avoid the city other than the museums and take yourself off round the suburbs where you’ll find great stores, cafes and restaurants."
2613,"The nutty reviewer and his better half decided it was time to visit Paris as we had never been before.     We did our research and found the Cler Hotel located on Rue Cler, an old market street from the mid seventeen hundreds. The hotel was clean and recently renovated, and the pricing was reasonable for Paris.   There was a nice buffet breakfast and an elevator as well.  What made our stay especially enjoyable was the great service we received by from both our hosts at the Le Cler hotel namely the hotel managers, Idi and Florentine.  They provided valuable information and great service and made our stay so enjoyable.  The area around the hotel was great too.  Rue Cler below us (see pic from our room) is a great street the locals use to get food, wine, cheeses, fish, and a la…"
2614,The hotel was nice on the whole. The room was clean and moder and came at a good price. The breakfast was pretty nice and came at a reasonable price. The main disappointment was the walls were very thin. 
2615,"I was here for work for a few weeks, and write this review based on my experiences in room 1620. I'll begin with the positive parts.   One of the best things about the room was the view, which included a spectacular moonrise, as well as multiple breathtaking sunrises.   I was also glad to have multiple dining options right next door, like a 30-second walk from the front entrance of the hotel. There were at least a half-dozen great choices, each with slightly different menus. I strongly recommend the noodle place on the lower level, as well as Lawson's convenience store.   The staff at the hotel was hard-working and friendly, although few spoke much English. However, all were adept at using phone translations to communicate, and were very receptive to finding ways to help.   The room itself was sufficient, with fresh water bottles each day, and full dispensers of shampoo and conditioner. And I appreciated the built-in clothesline in the shower, to dry lightweight laundry.   Although the room did not include an iron, there was one available for free use in the coin-operated laundry room on the ground level.   Breakfast was predictable and sufficient, including coffee and tea, cold vegetables for salad, pickled vegetables, two kinds of cold cereal, congee, multiple kinds of bao (including the custard kind, my favorite), as well as hard-boiled eggs, a green vegetable each day, purple potatoes, corn on the cob, rice, and pasta. Most days included a customized noodle soup option, but this was often not available until a little later (like 8).   There was much to appreciate about this hotel! But there were also a few factors that made the stay difficult overall.   First, the overpowering smell of cigarette smoke was so frustrating. It's a non-smoking hotel, but on multiple nights, the smell of fresh cigarette smoke was shockingly strong. Each time I complained, the front desk sent a security guard to sniff the air in my room, but no culprits were ever identified, and the bad air continued.   Second, the internet access was tremendously unreliable to the point it was not functional most evenings. This made it impossible to engage in necessary work in the evenings. Even the hard-wired computers in the hotel lobby did not have reliable internet. This is a serious issue to be addressed if we will continue to stay here.   Third, the carpeting in the rooms was pretty disgusting. My room's carpeting was heavily stained and worn, and the daily housekeeping service did not include vacuuming (evidenced by a peanut I accidentally dropped in an obvious location that remained in place for at least 6 days).   Finally, in spite of the restaurant choices right next door, the location is not great. It's not really walkable to anything of interest (aside from the university).   Overall, this was an okay but difficult stay, challenging for the reasons mentioned (primarily the cigarette smoke and the terrible internet connectivity). The highlight was the staff.…"
2616,"Booked this trip as a surprise for my boyfriends birthday. On arrival the guy that greeted us was very friendly. He said we had been upgraded to an executive room however this is what i had booked anyway so was a bit disappointed with that but not a big deal. When we got to our room, it wasn't the biggest of rooms but it was still lovely and very comfortable. After 5 minutes there was a knock at the door and the man from reception had brought us two cheesecake slices and two glasses of Prosecco as a surprise because they knew it was his birthday. I cant remember the mans name but he was very helpful and very nice. We didn't eat breakfast or dinner in the hotel but did have some drinks and really enjoyed them. All in all, i would recommend staying here. I would have gave it 5…"
2617,"My husband and I stayed at the Raleigh with our 16 month old daughter on our way back to London from the Cayman Islands. My husband and I stay in South beach every year and try a new hotel on our way home from the Caribbean. We have stayed in Mondrian, Lowes (with our daughter when she was four months) shore club and the national. We have travelled significantly with our daughter since she was born and I am now five months pregnant with my second child.  The Raleigh is not a four star hotel it is dark room is tiny and dirty- dangerous looking wires and mould on the bathroom window. The room is very dark and the TV doesn't work. If you try to use their hair dryer it trips a switch and lights go off I the room and hair dryer burns your hand. Apparently this is due to it being an…"
2618,"Great lounge gentil and helpful people.... was happy to be over christmas in the city.... Berlin had an image in Motel ONE ------ only breackfast is not that what we would see in such Hotel .... but if you re in the city ,,dont complean"
2619,I'm currently staying at this hotel. The staff has/has tried to fool me more than once and does not speak English fluently. I'm waiting to see how the staff acts at the lobby when I tell them I speak Portuguese. Furthermore there is a washing machine running everyday from around 7am to 10am and 7pm to 9pm on each floor making it impossible to sleep or rest in the neighbouring rooms. The breakfast is very good but overall this hotel gives no value for your money with its unreliable staff. I'm sure you can't loose choosing another hotel next to this.
2620,"I didn't had any Hilton Experience at Parc 55. At check-in the person at counter asked me for upgrade for $140 which i denied and he gave me the worst room on 4th Floor.  There is no swimming pool at this hotel, one need to go to next door Hilton to use pool. The room had some strong odor. At 8:00AM I wake up with the noise of construction crew who were fixing something outside my window.     As other reviewer, Christian V reported , it happened to me also. Every time i enter the hotel lobby they ask for room key and ID. I noted they don't ask white guys. I was with my family and it was embarrassing.  I think this has to something to do with the hotel's neighborhood  (lots of homeless and high crime rate) and part of employees training. The hotel is on the edge of Union Square,…"
2623,"Staying here was overall a pleasant experience. The location is good, it wasn't difficult to find, the rooms and bathrooms were clean and well layed out. My only real issue was that there was a severe lack of plug-ins in the room. For a room of eight (?) of us there was only a single plug by a tiny shelf high up on a wall. The issue seemed to be the same in other rooms as the plug out in the hallway with the lockers always had someone out there as well with their electronics, and if you went down to the bar, all the tables with plugs were usually taken up by a single person charging their stuff. Bring a power strip!"
2624,"Super helpful, friendly staff. In a really good location for seeing the city and getting around! There's a good kitchen to use and a breakfast included each day. The rooms are pretty average but have storage lockers for your stuff which is nice. Everything was clean and I would have no problem telling people to check it out!"
2625,We stayed at the Mercure moa from Monday to Friday. The hotel was lovely. The rooms were very clean and decorated tastefully. The bar and restaurant staff were fantastic. I would especially like to mention Florian and Hassan. We went to the bar to relax every evening after a long day sightseeing and their service was second to none. There is a seating area in the bar that you can sit and relax in with a bottle of wine. The only negative point was there was a convention on one night and they had completely shut the bar seating area off to hotel guests   I thought this was extremely poor as this was not explained to us the day before  or at check in by reception staff. Florian and Hassan ensured that we were seated comfortably in the restaurant and saw to our every need. The two…
2626,"We fell in love with this place from the beginning. Not just for its great location (you can walk everywhere), but for its staff and cleanliness. If you must catch a late flight (ours was departing at midnight), they are happy to keep your luggage at the Reception so we could enjoy one more full day of Barcelona. Although you don’t have all the amenities of a hotel, the best thing is that you feel like you are living as if you were a local."
2627,"This is a gem of a little hotel, in a super location.  It crams a lot into a small space and for a solo traveller I had  great little room, well organised with attention to detail, that I could use as a base from which to explore the city.  I found it to be a very well managed hotel and everything I mentioned was put right immediately.  For example the safe in the room was not working and within an hour or so was replaced.  The breakfast at 14 Euros is excellent value and well worth paying extra for. UI will return here."
2628,"Stayed in this pretty little hotel for a week. Great location close to the Eiffel Tower. Easy walk to shopping and metro station. Restaurants and grocery store around the corner. My teens loved this location. Reasonable rates, clean comfortable rooms with AC. Very helpful staff especially the front desk. When I go Paris again, I’m staying here. "
2630,"We stayed at San Francisco during 18.6.-6.7.2010 and stay approximately in six hotels. The Hotel del Sol was a big disappoint, in fact the worst hotel I ever have stayed. We travel a lot with my gf, and therefore we do know something about the hotels all around the world.   This hotel was loudy, rude, dirty and very unprofessionel by the staff. Our room was could at the night and even if I complain that (three times) they did not do anything about it. We had always the same guy in the reception and he was the rudest portier ever. Also the hotel was very noisy and the worst thing was that in our room (room 103) was without doubt mold. At least both of us had cough and our eyes were wet all the time. Not so nice... The room was very clammy also and stink bad..   Marina area was…"
2631,"The hotel is in a prime part of the city, I will give them that. Hotel room is very spartan and minimalistic for what you pay for. There's no amenities and the hotel room wasn't that clean when my friend and I arrived. Also, the hotel charged me an extra 2-person fee to have my friends get ready in the hotel (did not stay the night in the hotel). No use in arguing with the hotel manager who was very rude and abrupt and said he say four people instead of two people come out of the hotel room. Guess you can't have guests get ready at this hotel. Tried disputing the claim with the manager who said on the phone while I was talking to him that his security guard watched video tapes of 4 people coming out of the room. As I continued to explain my case, the manager then changed his…"
2632,"Arrived late at night, was greeted by reception and gal was very friendly.  Full points for being friendly and for good customer service.  However, that's where the honeymoon ends.  Upon check-in we were informed that check out was at 10a.  When requesting a late check out, we were informed that the hotel manager would need to be consulted.  Once consulted, we were given a late check out of 11a.  Wow, don't go overboard with that.  We were provided a ""Temporary"" room card that would allow us access to the fitness facilities and pool until midnight.  We had paid for an Ocean-View room. Upon arriving into the Accessible room, we immediately found a puddle on the floor that we had to mop up from the non-functional fridge.  I went to look out for the ocean, and I couldn't find it. …"
2633,"Check in was a mess.  The front desk folks could hardly speak English. Very difficult to understand and with a poor attitude.  Despite my company reserving a room block and having a confirmation they couldn’t find me a room.  Somehow this was my fault.  WTF!  Then, when they finally found me one it was a double.  The service is very poor and the location is not safe.  Do not recommend.  Furthermore, they are taking advantage of a local business conference people are attending and charging $1k/ night! They are seriously ripping people off.  This is unconscionable.  I am speaking with our travel people and we will not be staying at this hotel again. This is a distrusting place with disgusting staff and service."
2635,This was my first time to Barcelona and after researching & reading reviews I chose this hotel. It's a very nice hotel within minutes of Las Ramblas & Goth area. My room was very nice with a beautiful view of the cathedral across the street. It was lovely hearing musicians throughout the day from my patio. Room was very clean & very nice & comfy. Wifi is a bit spotty. I'm giving it 4 stars only because I didn't feel the hotel's front d again of course!
2636,"I've stayed in March for a conference. Well located near the Spittelmarkt  U-Bahn Station and in a walking distance to the museum island. Room is very spacious and comfortable, very cozy lobby and a tasty and variable breakfast. The staff is helpful and polite and the overall experience is worth a future stay."
2637,"Hotel was in a good position. Staff were helpful. Breakfast/food in general was good,the buffet provided during the day was very good value for money. The buffet in the evening was also very good. Piano plyer in the evening createda good atmosphere. Very poor quality room. Floor falling to bits, stains on bed linen, layout of the room poor. TV poor quality. Certainly not the standard one would expect from this chain or comparable hotel chains."
2640,Large rooms with very comfy beds Nice bathrooms Super clean Not far from Potsdamer Platz I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel Breakfast is quite expensive so I chose to go to Potsdamer Platz instead
2641,"Location , public areas and buffet breakfast all excellent but we had a top floor room at the main road end and it was dated and noisey late into the evening . Would go again but would like a room as shown in the photos and overlooking the pool area"
2642,"First, I love the fast wifi. I rely so much on it when i travel so when it's not working or it's DSL speed, it makes the whole experience miserable. Good job on that The rooms were somewhat small (but expected based on the hotel *** rating) but clean and well appointed. I like the breakfast room and the continental seemed pretty good but didn't have time to sit down for breakfast the 2 mornings I was there (although i did enjoy the orange juice). I'll be back. "
2643,Apparently my room that was pre assigned was changed in the computer but I wasn't aware of the change. At 1:30 AM someone was trying to get into my room as they were given a key. I asked for someone to come up but no one did. Only way I could get the person to leave was because I said that I was on the phone with the police! Couldn't fall back to sleep thinking person might come back. When I checked out no supervisor on duty and front desk staff could care less! There are supposedly cameras but otherwise no real security protocols in place.
2644,"I stayed at the Hotel Felix this past weekend and it was easily the worst hotel experience I've had in a really long time. The rooms are TINY. The walls were filthy. The view looked directly out into a construction zone. My parents stayed in the room next door and although they had a decent view of the city, the windows were so dirty you could barely see out. My mom and I tried to order 2 glasses of Pinot Grigio from the hotel bar. 20 minutes later the bartender came up to us to tell us they were completely out. No big deal (other than a 20 minute wait in an empty bar), we both picked another type. Then came the bill - $20 for each glass of win (that tasted like it cost them $1). I was appalled. The customer service was atrocious. They screwed up our reservation and rather than…"
2645,"I stayed at the Creekside Inn and it was very nice. Quiet and clean room, very nice breakfast, beautiful grounds. When I checked out I inquired about a room 5 nights later when I would be returning home, and was told it would be the same price. When I called that morning to book, I was quoted $20 more for the room. When I explained what I had been told before, I was told there was nothing they could do to change that. In the end, they charged me $10 more, BUT downgraded the room type that I had originally had. The room was clean, but there was no community information in it, and the television guide did not match the stations on the television itself. I inquired at the front desk, but they said they could not find a listing that matched the actual television offering. The first…"
2647,"The air conditioning was on heating and rooms where really hot, the front desk informed us that they usually don’t allow air conditioning on winter. Windows to let air in where really small, and it was extremely noisy Outside. The breakfast was ok but the people that served it was really rude. The parking lot was really small and it was first come first served. It is not as others Novotels around Europe. "
2648,I was disappointed overall in this hotel.  The location was grand and so was the lobby but the rest was lacking. The walls were badly scuffed and dirty and The carpet was stained. Our safe wouldn't  work properly because the batteries kept falling out because there was no cover so staff kept having to come up and open it. After the fourth staff member visited we gave up and stopped using the safe. The bathroom was FREEZING. There was no heat source so showering was definitely not pleasant.   The hotel is completely non smoking which is great but everyday our room smelled strongly of stale cigarettes. I mentioned this to staff twice but was told they couldn't smell it.  Our keys stopped working the day before we went home so we were locked out for 45 mins. The cleaning lady did…
2650,"Rated as the #1 hotel in Copa, I was expecting world class. My experience and the state of the rooms were subpar. The room was supposedly ready by 1400 but we were still waiting for it to be ready for another hour. The lady upfront was not helpful at all and actually charged us for an extra person in a 3 person prepaid room. Once checked in, we received a handicapped room. I was then called later that evening to move rooms. Both rooms were old and bland and the bathroom was outdated. Service in general was nothing to be impressed with.   The rooftop pool area was great although small. It gave us a great view of the blocos.   More english was spoken here, both by the guests and the workers.   A little further away from the beach, is Yoo2 which is an amazing hotel with much better…"
2651,"I stayed at this supposed 5 star hotel in the Hongqiao area with an important customer. After a three day stay on their executive floor, I had to leave for a short two day trip elsewhere. When I returned, they supposedly lost my reservation and instead of  a 1280 RMB rate, they insisted on 1900 RMB. The F1 race was going on then, and they needed my room I suppose.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL AND GO TO THE MARRIOTT OR HILTON PROPERTIES NEARBY!!!"
2652,"We organised a surprised weekend away for a friend's 40th and this hotel was perfect.  We had rooms 210 & 211 from Saturday to Monday and they were well appointed, clean, fresh and so quiet.  I was offered leading up to our stay to pay an additional €15 per room, per night for the their 'quiet' rooms and I am so glad we did not 'waste' the additional money as it was not necessary.  The only thing I would point out is their gym isn't very well equipped.    We checked in and headed out to do 'tourist' things, on our return late afternoon there was a small cake in the birthday girl's room.  This was just such a cute touch.  On check out, they worked out it was my birthday and I received a very cute Berlin bear.   Location is perfect for walking around the city, very close to an…"
2653,good place to stay but litte far from city center. around 15min walk to the corner of the city from central station. Rooms were good but can be redesigned to utilize empty space. more lights in room would be great. luggage storage facility after check out was very good. No super market around. over all experience is neutral nothing very outstanding or bad.
2654,"My 19 year old daughter and I stayed here during the first 2 weeks in July.  We payed extra for a room with a pool view and terrace and would highly recommend this style of room. The hotel is very clean and the staff very friendly and fluent in English.  The pool always had available sun loungers, although we were there between 9 and 10 on the days we used the pool. The beach is a 2 minute walk from the hotel and Rue D'Antibes, the main shopping area, is 2 minutes in the opposite direction.  There is a brilliant casino supermarket 5 minutes away. We will definitely return here - we had a fantastic holiday and have fallen in love with Cannes."
2655,"This visit to the Intercontinental there was constant electrical problems. The electricity in my room kept going off. In the middle of the night , 6 AM and during the day the power would shut off. And we order to have breakfast included in our stay. And before the food was great. This time I could not get a Hot breakfast. The food was barely warm. Even when I asked to have the eggs cooked fresh by the time they brought them to me they were barely warm. I tried this two days and I canceled the breakfast package. No use in paying good money for breakfast and could not enjoy it. I went to the nearby Burger King to pickup Breakfast for me and my wife. The others in my party went to the Ritz next door and other eateries in the area.  I dare not try dinner there if they could not…"
2656,"We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights and it was superb. The room was on 6th floor but lift worked fine. Air conditioning was a god send as we had the hottest temperatures on record for this time of year. Very clean and housekeeping staff kept it very tidy and replenished. The concierge Sergio was very good. He gave us lots of info to book trips and airport transfers and advised how to get to places. From moment we got there the bar staff knew exactly what they were doing. They told us about the 2-4-1 cocktails which we took advantage off. The following staff Sedha,Mehmet,Ellin and Marion were absolutely fantastic and well knowledged at what they did. Even when Ellin had to deal with awkward customer who couldnt understand the promotion even after she explained she was calm and…"
2657,We had a lovely stay in the hotel. Room was comfortable and staff were helpful and friendly. Location was good. Not too far from the main sights maybe a 20-30 minute walk. Good access to public transport links in the area. Bed was comfortable. Slept very well in container room apart from one night where there were trucks making noise in the post office yard at around 5am. Decking area outside bedroom was private in the evening and comfortable to sit out on  in good weather. An enjoyable trip. Would consider booking again for a future stay but probably a garden view bedroom and not a container. 
2658,Hotel was querky and different with a very interesting history.  Was close to trams which was very handy and made it easy to get around.  We booked a 2 Star room (double with shower/toilet) and the room itself was very adequate and we had a nice view of the canal.  The downside was that the pillows were terrible and we could hear other guests walking around on floorboards which impacted sleeping.
2659,Stayed 1 night in this hotel. 2 adults and 1 child. Staff were very friendly and extremely helpful. The room was clean and spacious and comfortable. The hotel is located just a short walk from Berlin Zoo and the main shopping district. Breakfast had all we could ask for and a nice little touch also adding brown paper bags with a note telling guests to help themselves to some pastries or fruit for later.
2660,"I liked this place. It's possible that I choose this place next time I visit Berlin. Close to public transport, not fare away from the airport Tegel and with tram 20 minutes from Berlin Mitte. Close to bakeries and different restaurants Affordable price. Yes I can choose this place once again!"
2661,Reading other reviews the overheating in the rooms seems to be a recurring problem from other people who stayed here. On entering the room the thermostat on the wall was indicating 32 degrees with the heating off. (The Hotel is NOT equipped with cooling function). I complained to office staff and they said they will open a window. The staff were very unhelpful. It was obvious they get many complaints from guests. It was a tiny window that they eventually opened and cooled the place down on a cold Shanghai winters night to 27 degrees. I could not sleep at that temperature. I checked out the next day and stayed at the Holiday Inn next to this hotel.  DO NOT STAY HERE.
2662,"The hotel was in a good location with restaurants, bars and shops within a stone’s throw.  It’s only about a 15 minute walk to Old Funchal town centre, with the port and sea front even closer and it’s very close to the Christiano Ronaldo museum (should you wish to visit that).    There is a roof top swimming pool which to be honest is quite small but being up there does allow you some nice views of the surrounding area.  The reception staff were very friendly and helpful.  The only thing that let the hotel down for us was the inadequate cooking facilities.  We choose the option of going self-catering with the intention of cooking a few meals for ourselves thus saving money on eating out every night.  However the room only had two basic rings and a kettle.  No microwave, no oven…"
2664,"This hotel is fairly new and close to the beach (if that is what you want) or metro. However, if you are there to visit city sites, this is not for you.   Positives; clean room close to beach and subway good breakfast (lots of choices for Spain) and good coffee  Not so positive: we walked everywhere and it was far from the tourist attractions.  Last time we stayed in Barcelona we were next to the Gothic quarters and it was much better. For this hotel, you need to go eat dinner BEFORE you come back or you end up walking/taking cab or subway once again. This meant long days. We much prefer to be in the center of things and have a less known hotel: location, location, location. As for getting to the train station, we ended up taking 2 different subway lines in rush hour and at…"
2665,"Beautiful hotel very good location for transport around Berlin , huge room with seperate bathroom and walk in wardrobe. The beds where very comfortable and room was very clean , plenty of coat hangers for our clothes and lots of tourist information books and maps in the room Only down side is there are no tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms"
2666,"This hotel is awful. At $300 a night, it's a complete scam.  The Starbucks downstairs was NOT open when we woke up Sunday morning at 6:30 AM. Yet we saw many people leaving the hotel at this time. And there's only one person on valet duty in the morning as well. No complimentary breakfast either. Fail.  The beds are SO uncomfortable that you feel like you're sleeping on a damn trampoline. Linens are thin and cheap. Rooms are very narrow and it's easy to smack yourself against a nightstand or dresser walking around.  Front desk people are useless. The girl working this morning 4/7 was not accommodating and couldn't get ahold of valet when we called to have the car pulled up. Zero customer service.  There are so many better options to stay in the area, I would avoid this hotel and…"
2668,"We stayed at the hotel for three nights and had a lovely stay. It is in a lovely location with good transport links to the rest of the city. We wanted to eat in German restaurants and found three within walking distance. The hotel is very much a boutique hotel, with only about 12 rooms so it feels cosy. It is staffed by the owners who are very friendly and has hand painted wall art everywhere imitating the surrealist artist Rene Magritte, which is very unique. Breakfast was lovely and overall I would recommend the hotel, however I am unable to give four stars because of the rooms. They have lovely high ceilings and various hand painted images on the walls, lovely comfortable beds BUT, the furniture is minimalistic to say the least. The furniture looks like half finished Ikea…"
2669,"Our family of five stayed in the first floor guestroom, whilst a little crowded it was clean and all set up before our arrival.  The staff were very welcoming and gave us great advice on seeing the local attractions and organising our taxi for a very early departure.  I would definately recommend this hotel for being budget friendly and a perfect location, we walked everywhere!  The included breakfast was also a bonus start to the day."
2671,"Booked a weekend in Berlin at this hotel, well situated and easy walking distance of all the major sites, helpful staff, clean well sized rooms... Kettle in the room would be a bonus but that's our only complaint. Breakfast is expensive unless you really want to take advantage of the all you can eat... However it is delicious and there is a wide choice. Would come again "
2672,"The room didn't have a robe, the mini bar was completely empty (It misses the whole point of having refreshments available whenever you want). Every time you order a room service there is a fee to have it delivered and I got charged R$ 100 because I friend visiting me for 15 minutes. "
2673,"Lost pair of prescription sunglasses in a palm-sized case; hotel security in speaking with 3 different gentlemen in conjunction with a front desk woman plus her supervisor cannot resolve this issue; they are all telling me different stories and I am now dealing with Anthony the Security Manager and he can't delivery updated results by calling me when he told me he would.   My family stayed there only because we had an early morning flight on Sunday 4/2 to Florida.   I have put in multiple calls the past 7 days to have nothing yet resolved.   Their idea of a room inspection is less than 5 minutes.   This case could have fallen out of something and rolled anywhere in that room like in front of the bed, behind the bed, in or under the lounge chair, under the curtains or behind…"
2674,"This is a reasonably priced, bijou hotel located close to the Champs Elysee. The rooms are small but perfectly formed. We had a room with a small balcony on  which we had our breakfast served each morning (at no extra cost).  The staff are really friendly and helpful . I would recommend this hotel without hesitation."
2675,"Very ideally located,great staff .Great rooms and service,they go out of their way to help.Will stay there again.As a Accor member you get good  perks .Gem in the city of Berlin.Will for sure return.Thank you"
2677,"The hotel is clean and modern. To get in to Alexanderplatz is about 15 minutes on the train and the train station is only about a 3 minute walk away so it is super easy. The breakfast was good and had a wide range of cold cut meats, breads, croissants etc. All of the staff we ran in to were really helpful if we needed directions or had questions. Great boutique hotel at a great price."
2678,"This is a huge hotel with magnificent ocean view from the room. However, the rooms need serious updating. The air conditioning is very noisy, giving you the selection of ice cold or too hot.  Balcony door won't close, so you should count on some noise from the ocean as well (charming for the first 5 hours of the night...)  Wi-fi is non existing, even in the lobby area. Staff seemed friendly, but very little english was spoken. The breakfast was amazing, but the room service dinner was below average.   The pool area is nice, but there is no real beach access in close proximity. Also, bear in mind that you are in the middle between Rio Vermelho and Barra, so you'll probably be doing a lot of taxi or walking."
2679,"Stayed here for the weekend for the Paris Marathon. Booked last year this was a great place to stay. The staff were brilliant and really helpful. The room was gorgeous and themed on Victor Hugo and Juliette Drouet giving a real Parisienne feel.   The bed was very comfy and whilst the mini bar was a little expensive as was breakfast a tad, this didn't detract from a fantastic little Gem in the heart of Paris just a 10 minute walk from the Gare du Nord. The bathrooms and room service were great and the decor simply fantastic.  The neighbourhood was fine with loads of places to eat and drink and a couple of mini supermarkets nearby plus an amazing patisserie about 5 yards away on the corner for fresh croissants to start your day.  Everything we needed was just a short walk away…"
2680,"It wasn't easy to find this tucked away hotel but after looking on Google earth we found it. It was in a slightly shabby part of town but as soon as we stepped inside we were pleasantly surprised, the reception area/bar is clean and nicely decorated with helpful friendly staff. Our room was clean and tidy with an adjoining room for our 2 children and a helpful mini kitchen. The bathroom could have been a bit bigger and I hit my thigh on the toilet roll holder a few times (!) Overall it was a comfortable stay, a bit of noise from other hotel guests at night but nothing too serious. Good value for money."
2681,"We are frequent travelers with several decades of travel under our belt including big cities with ""boutique"" hotels (our preferred category and why we chose the Raleigh this time) and we have stayed in South Beach on Collins oceanfront several times so when I say this, it isn't because we are novice travelers that do not understand hotels or South Beach.  This is by far the biggest miss and the most incorrectly rated hotel I have ever experienced anywhere.  The Raleigh is outdated beyond any reasonable person's expectation.  The rooms are small, run down and dirty.  The bathroom door cannot shut because it hits the toilet in a bathroom that is 5ft x 4ft total including the shower.  The wallpaper is coming down, the tv is literally from the 80's (and the carpet isn't even…"
2682,"The room is super clean. Location is great in middle of a lovely bubbly markets area packed w shops and cafes. 5-10 min cab ride to louvre and most of attractions.  Service is good, staff are super super nice and ready to help.  I arrived round 11am the day I check in and room is already available for me to use."
2683,"Stayed at the Londonhouse in April expecting a premium boutique hotel experience. Overall the hotel was a huge disappointment and not worth the price. When we to the front desk at 3:50PM after being notified in the morning our digital key was ready (""Blue"" members have to stop by the front desk before they can use the digital key); housekeeping had not been to the room yet. We waited about over an hour in the lobby for the room to be ready. We saw a number of other guests try to check-in after 4PM and be told their rooms were also not ready. It appears they have a lot of staffing issues in this area. The $18 continental breakfast was just plain bad (we received vouchers after asking because of the issues at check-in). The service at breakfast was non-existent and the selections…"
2685,"Location was good and the rooms were acceptable. Except for the shower and wifi. Shower hardly had any water coming out from it and kept going hot and cold. Wifi did not work at all from our room. Breakfast was boring, not much choice and did not taste all that good."
2687,This hotel is an ok place but 5 star it is not. The furnishings are tired and there is no concierge. The limited advice from reception was disappointing. Breakfast was monotonous and average for a 5 star hotel. Location is good and metro easily acccesible. Room a/c was noisy.
2688,"My husband and i stayed at this hotel during our anniversary vacation last week.......we upgraded to the penthouse suite, the price was insane for what we recieved.......The sheets were dirty, we didnt have enough towels, the mural on the wall was falling down.........not to mention the curtains in the room look like they had blood on them!!! There was hair all on the floor and stains on the floor.....We never swam in the pool because it was filthy the pool was chipping and the ""so called""  white safety tube had mold all over it.....Breakfast was just pitiful oranges apples water orange juice and toast was the worse. last but not least the bathroom was sooooooo small u couldnt leave the bathroom door open and take a shower, you had to brush up against the toilet from the shower…"
2691,"Service was not so good. small things I asked for, were not completed, or they took a long time. room did not have a window at all!! so was very dark in the room during the day. Very many small service related thing really made us not like this hotel at all! I will not name them all, but there was many! I wouldnt stay here again for this reason."
2693,"We booked a room at Sheraton Grand for our 44th wedding anniversary.   As we were driving into Chicago I noticed their rate had gone from $145 to $108, but thought that’s ok, we will enjoy the night.  However when we went to get our car out of self park, we could barely get our vehicle out, the exits were poorly marked and it cost &55.00 to SELF PARK!  When I called customer services they were not helpful at all!  Buyer Beware when thinking you are going to get complimentary parking when staying in Chicago.  We will not return!"
2694,"Good hotel,excellent rooms,great staff for the morning breakfast.A lesson in basic hospitality needs to be learnt.First night,one bottle of water of 500ml provided for two people Tired after a long flight,asked for more water.Voila,charged 8 euros for two bottles with a room service charge of 8 euros.Leftover paid for bottle left in room so no water provided today.Informed  the front desk,no response.No electric kettle in the room to make tea.Not justifying the five star tag."
2695,"Stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment for 3 nights. Got a good price online (certainly cheaper than 2 rooms in an equivalent hotel). No onsite staff after 6pm, but automatic entry system works fine (remember your booking code!) Very modern fixtures and fittings and kitchen well equipped to cook a meal if you didn't want to go out. Interior decoration somewhat idiosyncratic and rear room very dark (window overlooking internal courtyard). Would probably have been better if on a higher floor (we were on 2nd floor). Very close (2 mins) to metro station and only 10 minutes walk from Sagrada Familia. Plenty of shops & restaurants within walking distance."
2696,"This hotel was awful.  When I checked it the front desk was completely disorganized and understaffed.  The room was a standard hotel room. The check out process was worse.  The desk was understaffed again and there was a line of 8 people trying to check out.  It took far too long for a small hotel.  We valet parked our car.  Again, completely disorganized.  When we picked up our car in the morning one of the back windows was down a couple inches.   We rolled it up and left Chicago.  As we are leaving the city we notice that a rat has been in our car and chewing on a wrapped protein bar. Chewed on my coffee cup and left rat droppings on the cup and in the car.  Tore into a bag of clothes in the back that was set for a Goodwill donation.  When we called the hotel there was no manager to speak with.  The parking manager said that the window wasn’t down and that they check the cars.  It was about 15 degrees when we checked in and dropped off the car. And having driven almost three hours there’s no way the window was down.  So the valet had the window down and a rat enjoyed our car overnight.  The response from the hotel has been nothing.  The GM has not returned any of our calls or messages.  It was a poor experience before finding rat droppings in our car.  We’ve stayed at another 21c and visited two more beyond that.  We were very excited about our stay this weekend but it was an awful experience overall.  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. It’s a competitive market in Chicago and you should stay somewhere else!…"
2698,here is a truth and facts . lobby is nice. staff almost no English. maybe 1 out of 10 guys . restaurant and terrace and public bathrooms are filthy and stink. rooms are nice . location is good . no air condition or very limited . seems like you cant control it at all or they control it for  you .   
2699,"No doubt that this hotel is in a good location - close enough to walk to the old town but it’s not the most peaceful of places with the main road at the front and the port at the back with its continuous stream of cruise ships (sometimes 3 a day) and the natural noise from a port, sounding of the ships horn and so on. If the wind blows in the wrong direction you have fines and black smoke too. The new Savoy hotel next door is still under construction but almost finished so some noise from those works currently as well. In addition they seem to be cutting the grass, weeding or leaf blowing constantly so more noise. The sunbeds have seen better days too. Pool towels provided in the room but a weird system as the maid replaces them so if they are wet in the evening you will not…"
2701,This was my second time staying at the hotel. We again had a pleasant and comfortable stay. The price for the value you get is on point. The location is good and the staff are helpful. I'd recommend to anyone visiting Paris. 
2702,"The flavour of old Soviet Union Intourist is still there in this massive complex of hotel. There are constant queues, and slow moving ones, to the front desk. You would also spend a considerable amount of time waiting for the lift in this high rise of a hotel.  You will have to fight your way at the breakfast buffet to get hold of something to eat, and it is noisy. I also had the bad luck of getting a room with a bathroom that smelt of sewage for the entire stay. Upon check out the staff pointed out I could have asked to change rooms, which is true. But then I would have had to queue up deal with the non-service minded staff, e.g. declining to order a taxi. But I did get a smile from the lady checking my name at breakfast. The best feature of the hotel is an amazing gym, best…"
2703,"This was our second time at Opera marigny hotel, and it was absolutely perfect! The location is great, the team is kind and helpful and the rooms are modern modern and clean. We will definitely be back"
2704,"While this hotel is well located with easy access to public transportation and near many restaurants, we found the room very sparse for what we paid. In addition to the bed, there were only two desk chairs and no other seating for comfort. Breakfast was plentiful and delicious. The staff were pleasant and helpful with recommending restaurants and giving directions. "
2706,"Very good breakfast choices.Nice big room with all facilities, except not the cleanest of rooms. Whilst unpacking stuff I found  there was a big thick layer of dust in the bedside cabinet, hairs in the shower and a blocked sink. I also wrote a note to the housekeeper to change the bed linen, which was ignored. Not very good service for a 4 star hotel."
2708,"We were only here for a few days but couldn’t ask for a better spot. The room was adorable and quiet. The staff were friendly and the breakfast buffet had more than enough to choose from. The hotel is perfectly located! We were walking distance to Notre Dame, the Louvre, Eiffel Tower, the park, the catacombs, and mulberry street in the Latin quarter, which I highly recommend you visit"
2711,Hecker hotel is located in a charming area of Berlin: Charlottenbug. There are plenty of restaurants and bars around and a good access to the city center (10min max by public transport) and from Tegel Airport (15min). The Hotel staff is very friendly and we welcome you in different language. It appears I had a huge room (312) including a walking wardrobe and facing the back of the hotel it was very quiet. The restaurant next door offers the room service and it has very nice dishes.
2712,"We had a great short stay at the hotel Berlin Mitte. The room was great (we stayed in room 409), was lovely and quiet for a city hotel. The staff were all very pleasant. We did pay for the breakfast which may seem steep in price but we thought it was well worth it, the food was delicious and plentiful. The underground is literally a 2 min walk away and that gets you pretty much everywhere you need to get, if you don't fancy walking. We would definitely return here."
2713,"A really lovely little hotel, well located on a buzzy street with lots of nice cafes and restaurants, and near to a couple of metro stations for getting around. The rooms are great, modern and well designed (although not huge), and immaculately clean. The staff are super friendly and helpful too. My only minor minor negative was the hot breakfast wasn't brilliant quality given it cost €19, however, there was a huge range of other breakfast choices, so this wasn't a disaster! I would definitely stay here if I visited Paris again, not sure I'd even bother looking elsewhere if prices were the same. Thanks!"
2714,"The hotel is ok located, beach front, but most rooms don’t have sea view. The restaurants don’t serve breakfast unless you have the breakfast included on your fee (which I didn’t) and there’s NO PLACE  IN A 15’ Uber to eat other than here. The worst thing is there’s not only one BUT TWO constructions going on: one inside the hotel, by the pool (banging, sewing, you name it) and the other next door, building a whole new apartment building. I’m most certainly not satisfied with my 200 usd"
2715,"Superb Location, Very comfy Beds, Good A/C and great Shower. Front Desk personnel was very friendly but  unfortunatley service and follow up were slacking. Details have been reported to the hotel. The room was very modern but rather dark and only little daylight gets in the room. Overall, I felt that we did not receive the proper value for money paid."
2716,"I have been coming to this hotel for years, since the opening, also having a corporate agreement with my company.  Yes, rooms are clean and spacious but the overall service has gone down and prices are more than double than it used to be. Impolite staff like they don't care anymore, wrong information provided by the staff,, they advertise free WiFi, but is not, 70% of the time when you check in the room that you have booked is not available, they offer a smoking room instead, or you have to wait.  I won't never come back again never ever!   "
2717,"I have been coming here for years. I visited a few months ago and the quality of food in the executive lounge had got significantly worse. To the point of only being marginally edible. Today I was confronted with this bacon (see photo) in the lounge. Really it’s just fat. If the point of a room on the executive floor is the lounge, then don’t bother.   The hotel itself is still good, although I worry that what’s happening with the executive lounge will extrapolate into other restaurants and the rooms too. Clearly management either doesn’t know, or doesn’t care, about what’s going on."
2721,"We checking early, at midnight my son came from Tallahassee to spent the long weekend with us. We was on the second floor and got the elevator, we got stuck in the elevator for 20 minutes calling from the emergency call inside the elevator and nobody answered, the staff wont ever went near the elevator to check if we was okay. We even had to call 911 to see if someone could help us. And guess how we get out the elevator? A guess just press the bottom to go in and the elevator open immediately, easy as that, but the staff even had the intention to get close to the elevator. This hotel is not safe at all and I will never recommend it."
2723,"Not a bad stay, just an inconsistent one. Some great things are the provision of breakfast items to your room (milk, bread and eggs), bed was comfy and locale is good. Downsides were poor room cleaning (one day it was done, one day they completely forgot is and bed wasn't made, nothing replaced), and lots of failure to notice details in renovations (patches of walls and doors not fully painted). Bathroom very pokey and with towel hooks inside the shower so they never dried. Air con was not always working properly. Fine stay but the price was too high for what you get."
2724,I was impressed with this hotel. The staff were very welcoming and always helped with all my questions regardless of English not being their first language. The rooms were very clean and spacious and  was a welcoming relief at the end of each tiring day we spent in Barcelona.
2726,"We stayed here for two nights and were more than satisfied with the rom. It was spacious for a Paris hotel of this class and spotlessly clean. Our room was at the rear of the hotel so there was no street noise. Large comfortable bed and excellent shower. Breakfast was ok, but much cheaper in one of the nearby bistros. The hotel staff were very obliging, ordering cabs for us and storing our luggage for the whole day as we had a late evening train. The hotel is conveniently located for exploring Montmartre and there is a bus route into the city centre only a short walk away. Be aware that the nearest metro station has no lift and a lot of stairs."
2727,"We had a nice time at the Hotel de Varenne. The monsieur that works the overnight shift was the best    He was helpful and took very good care of us!  I would stay just because he worked there.   All of the staff were helpful.  Merci,   "
2728,Small rooms but efficient service. Good breakfast. Helpful staff. Great location near Passeo de Gracia and Gaudi masterpieces. Close access to metro station and good restaurants in the area. It was convenient to stay at Room Mate Emma for us. 
2729,"Just had a weekend here.  Was very impressed with this hotel. Friendly staff , clean and modern. Had a twin room with very comfortable beds. Quite a small room but we were out all day anyway. The bathroom/ shower was nice with underfloor heating. Breakfast was  continental and quite busy but we always found a table. The location was good- 5 mins to the Tv Tower. I would have no hesitation in staying in this hotel again"
2731,Supposedly a 3star hotel yet the pool was dirty and not heated as claimed. The staff just were unhelpful and refused to even be courteous they were just inept. From checking in until the entire next day they could not make keys because the system crashed ? So everyone had to get escorted to their rooms or have people stay behind to keep doors open for people while protecting their goods!! It was a disaster and the staff not once apologized or did anything to make our stay more pleasant they just shrugged it off and stood there with blank faces and even were upset that customers kept asking when the problem would be fixed ?!!!   And during our whole stay it was not!! I will never stay in such a rude hotel ever I’ll keep my money spend it elsewhere.
2732,"I stayed here for 3 nights during the European Athletics Championships. The location is fine but just a little bit out of the way, and a few dark and empty streets to walk through if coming back late at night. My room was large and airy, great bathroom and shower, lots of storage, and excellent coffee machine. Breakfast was also fantastic. Food was good but a little pricey, and included a ridiculous charge for room service (which to be fair was avoidable if you went and picked it up yourself).  All staff were extremely helpful and very pleasant.  Would definitely stay again."
2733,"We enjoyed a lovely break in July 2017 at Dom Pedro Madeira in Machico. This was not our first visit to Madeira but it was our first visit to this hotel. Our first impression was that the architect had captured the colours and textures of Madeiran home life and culture beautifully in the building, for example, the basket weave ceiling panels.   On arrival, staff at reception were not immediately responsive being young and new and did not give us the correct information, despite our use of Portuguese rather than English which we thought might help. That aside, our room was perfectly good, clean and well-appointed and housekeeping was excellent during our stay.   The restaurant is beautifully appointed but the all-inclusive food package was not impressive and did not reflect…"
2734,"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights for £69 per night via a deal using Agoda. Excellent value in a great location right at the heart of Montmatre (10 min walk from Sacre Coeur). We really liked the hotel - clean well-decorated room, large comfy bed, nice en suite shower with hairdryer. Service was friendly and helpful - they assisted with booking a taxi to the airport and printing out our boarding passes for the return flight. They even provided a corkscrew for a bottle of wine that we bought from a local supermarket. We'd definitely stay there again."
2735,Cheap place to stay if you don't mind stopping in separate beds. However in the heat of Barcelona it's probably best you sleep in separate beds.  The beds are comfortable and allow you to get a good nights sleep. The private bathroom was lovely and had access to a shared kitchen however this would be very small if the other room was wanting to use it at the same time.  One major downfall for why this place didn't get 5 stars was that it doesn't have air con. One fan in the room that hasn't made a difference.  Location is great in the middle can go either way towards the marina and towards the gothic quarter and other tourist areas.  Staff were very friendly on the reception. Would stay again if I was here looking at the city but not for a holiday due to no air con.
2737,Close to the Messe. I could practically walk to it. Clean and quiet. I like the breakfast hall it has a lovely view over the town on the 8th floor. Also the receptionists are always helpful showing me around. This was my second stay. I will come again. 
2738,I don't know how the are receiving such high reviews.  The rooms are very old. Furniture is old as well. The appliances and plates/cuttlery was very poor.  Couldn't cut through butter the knives were so blunt. Staff were friendly but woke us up our first morning at 7am to remind us of a free tutorial that was happening at 8.30am... wasn't happy.  All in all not a bad experience but really needs a good renovation. 
2739,"A wonderful hotel in the middle of Montmartre. Due to the location in a small hidden side street the hotel is very quiet, but super central. The staff is very helpful and flexible. The breakfast is small but fine.  You can have breakfast in a cozy and family atmosphere. Either in the entrance hall which is stylishly furnished or in a small courtyard. The rooms are clean and have great beds. Here you can sleep well. We stay here every year for a mother-daughter trip to enjoy Paris. For sure come back next year ;)"
2740,"Everything was good, there is nothing I could complain about, very friendly and helpfull staff, great location, huge breakfast - everyone could choose sth for yourself, nice and cosy indoors, very high standards"
2741,"Recently stayed at this Ibis Budget, very nice cheap and comfortable central Berlin hotel, right next to Wittenbergplatz and the main shopping street. Amazing transport links with a U-Bahn station being a mere 2 min walk from the hotel. Comfortable beds, very thin but ok, pillows were very soft i had to bulk up with a quilt. Very clean, basic features but very good value for money. Recommend for anyone wanting a cheap stay in the centre of Berlin. Very helpful check in staff and clean and modern lobby area."
2742,"The staff were nice is about it. The pics of the hotel online must of been from years ago. The room and hallway on the 12th floor smelled bad and mildewy. The room was dirty and looked like a hostel. Our towels were dirty, bedsheets dirty and old. Housekeeping had an old shopping cart they just left out in the hallway. The pool was the size of a large bathtub basically.  "
2744,"The location is awesome. Next to bars, tourist attractions and in front of the beautiful Vondelpark. Stayed in a 6-bed room. The room was ok and quiet, but toilets weren't very clean and they were small. Breakfast is very simple. Suggest to eat something nearby. The hostel could include at least cheese. Attention if you travel with big luggage - not a friendly place for it. Lots of stairs, no elevator. Almost no interaction with the guests, not even in the bar... Would be back just because of the location."
2745,"We stayed for only one night due to our flight being canceled. Was a good thing that it happened cause we had the opportunity to enjoy this beautiful hotel and the amazing view from the rooftop bar.  The room was very spacious and cosy, bigger than any other Indigo Hotel that we stayed before, with a very stylish and spacious bathroom. The bed was super comfortable, we had a very good sleep.  We enjoyed the sun on the rooftop terrace the next day with amazing view over Spree and East Side Gallery.  The staff was very attentive and friendly. We definitely recommend!"
2746,"Hotel R.Q. Is a fun and relaxed place to use as a base for a visit to this great city.  The staff is great and so helpful!  They made our daily explorations easier with great info on transport routes and little sites to see.  The location is fun- a bit off the tourist route- so felt more at home- but really close to the Metro (green line 12) and good 'old bus #39, which can take you near most of the main sights near the center of the city. So hoping we have a chance to return. Both to Paris and the Hotel R.Q."
2747,"One of the best hotel choices in Berlin. Nice room, clean, charming furniture. Good staff, with very helpful receptionists. And the location is excellent. I definitely will try to book a room again when I go back to Berlin."
2748,It was such a disappointment to have a cleaner steal from the room. Would not feel like returning as had little confidence in management follow up although theft was admitted. Entertainment is varied from ok to poor.
2749,"Nothing worked, charged to have UTENSILS delivered to my room, internet was only free because my conference provided it....unbearably HOT in the room even though it marked 18*c....staff extremely impatient and rude"
2750,"We had the pleasure of staying at this brilliant and unique hotel. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff were friendly and very helpful, the hotel clean and very pink! We made use of the instrument room service which was a definite extra perk. Special thanks to the concierge (Rich) I think, and another guy who's name didn't get but he was the brain behind the classical elevator, they were both extremely helpful in helping us decide where to visit! We definitely plan to come again in the future!!!"
2751,Nice room and furnishings and very nice view looking along the Spree. But the wifi took some trouble to sort out initially. And as usual with this sort of hotel a tourist party crowd that was leaving made it quite awkward to get in when we arriving on foot with cases from the bus from the Hauptbahnhof. Good situation near the Sbahn station Bellevue (apt name). A not very posh area which was also interesting.
2752,"This is my second stay and I won't be coming back for a third . The hotel is beautiful with an atmosphere of 5 star luxury and sophistication, however the service is nothing like this . I was told at breakfast that they had no more orange juice ! Please ! They were just about to finish service and obviously didn't want to be bothered with replenishing. Drinks in the lobby on two nights gave shocking service. Waited 25 mins for a drink to be brought with was a second drinks round so our order was in the system . The staff can't speak good English so any complaint or look of frustration as a customer is lost in translation . My colleague had to make 3 choices of wine from the wine menu before arriving at one that they had in stock ! This is shocking for a hotel this pricey and…"
2753,"Loved this hotel. Had a boutique feel too it. Each room was individually designed, and beautiful. Ours had a small balcony, with a pretty view. Rooms were spacious and clean. The breakfast buffet was excellent. And the staff all very friendly and helpful. We had a wonderful stay, and will definitely stay there again."
2754,"There isn't really anything good I can say about the hotel apart from the fact that it is relatively central in Buenos Aires and has a nice pool (which is flanked by two major streets). The staff at the reception desk don't really seem to know anything - not even the price of the breakfast. We didn't get our rooms forever and when we did, they were at a lower standard than what we'd booked. On Thursday night there was a big party on the 1st floor (without prior warning) until late at night despite the fact that this is supposed to be a business hotel, i.e. people work on a Friday. The rooms are really old and so are the bathrooms. My shower was barely more than a trickle. The breakfast is okay but really not great. We had dinner in the same restaurant which wasn't good at all.…"
2755,"Had booked for two weeks but the rules of this hotel include no friends in your room, no friends at the pool, which is hopeless if you are on holiday visiting friends. The security in the hotel meant I was stopped and asked for id four times In two days. The staff are surely and the management worse. I had a junior suite which had great views but nasty furniture, it even had a white metal table in the room that would better in a garden not a hotel room. I left after two Days all they did was apologise and made no attempt at compensation I would not use it ever again "
2756,"They had no record of the package we booked directly through their website. I booked this package for my wife's birthday-""Fall in Love... Again"" package and had a confirmation email. It should've included a welcome bottle of wine, spa credit, late check-out, and VIP status.  Issue 1: Front desk incorrectly stated they had no record of our reservation. Turns out the agent just wasn't paying attention when I stated the name the reservation was under. Caused undue stress thinking we did not have a place to stay.  Issue 2: We asked to confirm our spa appointment and spa credit. We were told we had to call or visit the spa ourselves. Why couldn't the front desk agent do this while we were checking in?  Issue 3: No welcome bottle of wine. It wasn't rectified until after we had to…"
2759,"The hotel grounds are beautiful; the pool is lovely; eating around the tables at the pool is nice and quiet and a lovely setting; rooms are clean and efficient. The hotel is located right across from the Calderra beach and the bus stop is right out front the door. The views from the balcony of the whole calderra are breathtaking!  The rooms are clean and nice but the showers are teeny... think camper (RV) size small. When we checked in, the girl was friendly and helpful telling us about the area and pointing things out on the map. There are no coffemakers in the room, so one of my travel mates went down at 7:45am to ask for a coffee (Breakfast isn't served until 8) and the staff member yelled at her and shooed her out. OK, so maybe she didn't quite understand that she was only…"
2760,Pros : +Top bar  +Top rooms  +Top Service  +Top rooms   -No cotton swabs -Horrible bathrobe 😂 (no function at all!) -shower towels are too small in my opinion   I’ll be back soon - with my own robe ;)  Anytime again!
2762,Facilities were good. Breakfast was adequate with enough selection. Bar was nice enough as was the roof terrace. We had issues with getting a bed for our 7 year old daughter but that was not the hotel's fault (company we booked through). We hoped that the hotel would have provided some sort of concession. Concierge service was good. Overall there was a general lack of 5 star service.  
2763,Hotel ask for advance payments and don't settle it with actual expenses during check-out. Instead the reception staff says it'll be transferred into bank account from where you paid by next day of your check-out but even after several days they don't return it.
2764,"We spent 5 nights at the Eiffel Seine and really enjoyed it.  This is more of a boutique style hotel with a comfortable feel and small hotel vibe.  The location was great, short walk to the Eiffel tower, comfortable walk across the Seine to Champs-Elysees, great Crepes right next door and some pretty awesome little restaurants a few blocks away.    If you are into getting around town and not spending a lot of time stuck in a hotel this is the place for you.  If you want to spend all day in your hotel or in bed and get pampered with full service, this is not the place for you.  The train noise was not an issue. The honesty bar was awesome for pregame drinks, the front desk attendants (all of them) were helpful and knowledgeable, bed were comfortable, shower was great and we…"
2765,Housekeeping is the worst. It did not do what they are supposed to do.  No housekeeping came to clean the room.  They sent somebody after we complained; and did not change the linen.  No cleaning was done.  The hotel lobby is so small and dark.  We will not come back to this place.
2766," It was a very good stay. I arrived quite lately on my check-in day so I found it really convenient as location was very city center and I did not need to change the airport shuttle as it arrives very closely to this hotel. Room was very spacious and clean. I enjoyed the view from my balcony to the street of old town in Berlin. Despite it is located in the vivid, touristy and crowded area I had very quiet and peaceful stay there. I could study in focus for my exam with no difficulties. Wi-fi stable and quite fast.  From cons - I would only prefer to have breakfast in better quality. "
2767,"A fantastic hotel nestled in a lovely quiet street but close to lots of bars and restaurants. A great location with all of Paris within walking distance of the front door.  From the welcome, to the bedrooms and breakfast, everything was just perfect, highly recommend! "
2768,"Wonderful, intimate hotel with amazing ""above & beyond"" staff. Made us feel like friends rather than just guests. Elegant but low key atmosphere.They seemed to know the answers to our questions before we even asked them !!! Which was good because none of us were fluent in French. Great location on the Left Bank- walking distance to many landmarks. Lovely lounge and breakfast area. Rooms are small but easily  accommodate Queen size beds -not always true in Europe. The perfect little hotel. We will definitely be returning to France soon and will most certainly return to our friends at Academie Hotel Saint Germain !!!"
2769,"So maybe a bit cruel as a title, but the place is a bit of a let down to be honest.  I got a room upgrade which was very much appreciated & the room is amazing, big, roomy, huge bathroom, comfy sofa, lovely bath & very comfy bed.  The staff are fab, very helpful & friendly, though some are a bit on the shy side & give the impression that they are a bit new on then job (but still very friendly & helpful)  Sadly, the food & the bar are a big let down following the promise of the decor & room standard. Pizza in the bar is very mediocre & the restaurant food is pretty forgettable (though I will remember the prawn spring roll for its weirdness). The bar is well stocked but very few mixers for spirits & the bar man is actually restaurant staff & he tries his very best, but he doesn't…"
2770,"We loved Funchal but the hotel was ok, not more. Some staffmembers were very professional while others were not welcoming at all.  The breakfast was ok but the restaurant served us dinner that was terrible. Boring and the meat was like rubber. We decided to eat out each night. No spices and not what we expected."
2771,"Excellent service, friendly, professional and willing. Above average rooms, excellent location. Not happy there are no irons in the rooms, the community ironing area is no enjoyable experience. The art work is superb, modern and fitting of the lobby space. Can recommend for a conference just bring an iron."
2772,"I recently spent a weekend at the Element.  When I arrived in the room there was no small bar of hand soap next to the bathroom sink.  I stopped by the front desk on my way out to let them know it was missing and was told that the hotel hadn't received their normal delivery.  I asked why they hadn't bought a couple of bars at the huge supermarket 50 yards from their door.  The agent shrugged.  I bought 3 bars for 1 euro myself.  The first time I've ever had to buy my own handsoap.  The breakfast at the Element has also been simplified.  Bread, fruit, yogurt and cereal are on offer.  The breakfast offer is very light, even compared to what was offered 6 months ago.  Immediately after their opening the staff went out of their way to assure their guests that hot food would soon be…"
2774,"This hotel is up there with the best in respect of comfort, cleanliness, food, service and location. The staff are friendly and are more than happy to recommend places to visit, shop or restaurants and the reception staff speak english The rooms are exceptionally clean and decorated to a high standard whilst the bathrooms are large and modern. The hotel is situated across the road from the train and metro station and within walking distance of the Lafayette shopping mall, the Harrods of Paris. The breakfast is ideal with cereals, juices and croissants . I cannot recommend this hotel high enough a wonderful find."
2775,"I came in exhausted from travel and looking for accommodation. What ensued was the worst hotel experience I've ever had. I legit thought the staff was going to force me to sleep with the addicts outside.   The room was paid for already. All that was needed was the incidentals deposit. I had a bit of bad luck and lost my company card and only had my ID on me. Didn't realize until I was at the counter.  At least the room was paid for, right? I plead my case only to get a lecture about how never in his past did he see someone so unprepared, irresponsible, etc. It wasn't exactly the plan to lose my credit card, but yea thanks. Didn't seem to matter that 3 days were already paid for. The night manager  Ijust wanted to leccure me on my misfortune and not help in front of other…"
2776,"This is my second time here. I stayed here for 6 nights. Very close to Monumental metro station, close to Sagrada Familia (you can see it from outside of the hotel).  The rooms are very small, but nicely furnished, decorated and also very clean. The beds are VERY VERY confortable. I would have loved to have a night table (there is a small night table over the fridge, but it is not enough).  Friendly receptionists and kind staff.  Good breakfast - 4 kinds of fish, ham, cheese, 5 kinds of bread, scrambled eggs, jamon, gaspaccio, 6 kinds of sweet pastries (including croissants), salad, fresh tomatoes, fresh fruits (kiwi, pineapple, grapes, peaches, bananas, apples and oranges), yoghurt (fruity and natural), milk. As you can see, you really can choose.  Please, when you will…"
2777,We had a cocktail for sunset on the amazing rooftop dominating the city and the beaches towards Mandelieu. If you like also fireworks It’s the best place where to see these unbeatable shows. The best triad: charming people in a charming place of a charming location.
2778,Great hotel. Front desk guy with glasses was hilarious. Food was pretty good. Eat outside and enjoy the beautiful exterior. Pool and Spa were great too.   Rooms a little bit small. Need a little bit of updating.
2779,"We got a good price for three nights,for five people ( two rooms). The hotel is good and clean, it has small rooms, but fine for a city trip. Beds were good, the pillows need replacing however. Yes, there were a lot of young people staying, but that may have to do with the fact that it was Christmas break; anyway it didn't bother us. Breakfast is relatively cheap, but good. Excellent location because of proximity to the Hauptbahnhof, which was perfect for us travelling with two elderly people. Friendly and helpful staff, one member even helped us when he was already on his way out at the end of his shift. Lobby was very crowded, caused by a very small reception manned by only two staff. Also, two very small rooms for luggage storage, which seemed a bit impractical for such a…"
2780,"A good hotel, but the price was not ideal. A great greeting and great receptionists, but the room was not ideal. Not a great bed to sleep in and not an ideal price for a similar hotel room. The location was really good for the city centre, but not too busy an area. Hotel food was average and staff were very busy in the restaurant."
2781,"I enjoyed the atmosphere of the hotel, but for me our room was way too small for the price. there was a upper level near the window where we needed to put our suitcases. which didn't give us any room what so ever. Not comfortable. The bed was made during the day and clean towels left... but the dirty mugs not touched and the garbage. On the positive side. I loved the shower!"
2782,"I spent three nights at the Furama Resort - was travelling with work, so can't opine on the ""value for money"" aspects.  Food and drinks at the resort are fairly expensive - but all that is in the area is 4 and 5 star hotels, so you can see why.  Food was okay - but nothing stood out.  The resort was one of the first resort built in Da Nang - it is in a great location, with private beach access and a number of pools.  An ample number of chairs / lounges by the pools and beach. The hotel interiors are really well maintained and it doesn't show its age as much as you would expect.  Rooms are really spacious - had a garden view room - which still had ample room and a separate lounge setting.  Bathrooms have a modern appearance but the facilities, particularly the shower, is sub-par.…"
2783,"Having checked in online speeded up the process and with a few words of direction, I was in my room. Large enough with all facilities, it was quiet from any traffic noise. Proximity to the centre with good U Bahn connections for further afield travel makes the location and facilities ideal."
2784,"we were in Paris for a weekend and stayed at this hotel. the hotel is very well located, next to the Eiffel Tower and in front of the metro. The staff is very kind and the room was nice and quiet!  I recommend for a tourist weekend, the value for money is excellent!"
2785,"I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in December 2016, it was a great base to travel around Berlin.   The staff were friendly, helpful and the hotel was clean, warm and good value for money.   I would happily stay in this hotel again and recommend it for short stays in Berlin. "
2786,"The hotel was at a great location right by union square. But the hotel was not  First there was a confusion we booked a room with two beds. But when we checked in there was only one bed available. So we got a room on the 6th floor. When we got to our room, it was not what we expected. It seemed like a honeymoon room. The room was very dark. The bathroom sliding door did not lock. So if someone would use the bathroom, it was easy to see inside.  Another part was our view out the window (if you would even call that a window). It was very dark and the view was just a beam going all the way down to the first floor. But the best part was that it was leaking in our room. We woke up to the sound of rain with a puddle of water on the carpet.   Although the location was great, we would…"
2787,"The hotel is great, customer service is amazing, staff very helpful. Location, it’s 5 minuets walking to metro station which is 20-30 minuets away from down town. Next to Ajax Amsterdam stadium, there is a variety of food, entertainments and grocery around the hotel. The only problem I faced at the hotel is room service, it’s not as clean as it should be. "
2790,"Granted... I arrived late to the hotel (around 11pm). Yet, that doesn't justify the fact that I had to wait in line 30-40 minutes to finally being told by the front desk clerk that the hotel didn't have a room for me.   On top of that the clerk told me that I am not senior enough (or elite, I don't remember the exact term/words) on the rewards program to have a guaranteed reservation. Is this a joke? I got both ditched and told that I am not important on the same night!  The hotel is in a convenient location because it is next to the airport. However, I won't book this place again just out of principle. The good thing is that there are many other options near O'hare."
2791,"The Arco Hotel on Geisbergstr (in the Schoneberg neighborhood) is located on a quiet, tree-lined street just a very short walk from three U-Bahn stations and a couple of S-Bahn stops.  It's within walking distance of the KaDaWe store, to say nothing about some great restaurants and clubs.  I was there over the Easter weekend, and it's a terrific place to stay.    Though close to everything you'll want to visit in Schoneberg, the Arco Hotel is  in a quiet, leafy world of its own.......kind of like staying in a beautiful brownstone in the West Village of New York.   My recently refurbished room (223) overlooks the back garden (huge window) and featured a most comfortable, large double bed, beautiful linens, new full bath accented by glass tiles, and a huge flat screen TV.  The…"
2792,"In an effort to find one positive experience at the Embassy Suites, I will select ...  the bed. The king size bed and pillows were outstanding.   Sadly, the bed did not make up for the broken tub, peeling/bubbling paint in the bath, broken shower curtain and inoperable phone.  When I called the front desk on my mobile phone to fix the room phone, staff indicated that an engineer would address.  Maybe she meant it would be addressed at the time of our departure, because I never saw an engineer.  The rooms are dated.  The staff was pleasant enough. But, certainly not worth my rate. Never again."
2793,"Hotel was in walking distance of museums, a great park, and an area with lots of restaurants..  Rooms were a good size and only negative was the rugs that were quite stained.  The staff were helpful, but did not have good information on hop on/off bus.  Should not complain since they are not concierges, just front desk staff.  Good experience."
2794,"The hotel is in a convenient location & has decent sized rooms. Bed comfortable, room modern & clean. Decent breakfast with a nice atmosphere as it is served in an adjacent cafe, hence no canteen touch. Will go again."
2795,"This hotel very much exceeded my expectations. First, it was very cheap and in a very good location in central Berlin. The room was nicely designed, modern and clean. The bed was very comfortable and the various lighting options in the room were particularly nice. The staff was very friendly. I would definitely stay there again and I recommend! Small improvements that could be made: it would be great if there was a refrigerator in the room, and sheets could be a bit softer. Other than that everything was great!"
2796,"Good central location, kind hotel personnel, spacious rooms. Very dated building and rooms furniture that give the impression of not being clean. Loud elevator, air conditioning and roof pool installations."
2797,"Wrong reservation at arrival, no free wifi in rooms and just 1h in lobby, lobby by the way in works, you shouldn't give for rent the rooms around the lobby it's to loud. No complementary water in the room, no slippers. The new lobby decoration looks strange, it's like if we were sitting in a money's cage. I really don't appreciate this hotel, very low standard ! "
2798,"It is the worst hotel I've ever been in my life. The price paid was very expensive and not really worth every dollar paid there.  The most important thing when you go to a hotel is the bed. The President Hotel has the worst beds I've never slept on. The mattress is cheap and  poor quality. The beds are destroyed and a horrible sound every time you move the on beds. After talked with the manager (because was not money back) she did to me an upgrade to the Penthouse level. She said it had better beds and new mattress. But it was exactly the same. Sound coming out from the bed, seemed the sound of a rusty old door without grease  The walls are very thin and you could hear all the sounds of the bed in the other room   Never mind making love in those beds because the entire floor…"
2800,"Perfect boutique hotel in the best area in Paris, perfect for holidays and running around Paris with friends/family, or via business...I did both.  Staff very friendly and made great recommendations and reservations for us, great Boulangeries very close by, Carrette, grocery store.  Great style and chic, comfortable and modern."
2801,"This hotel was booked by our tour operator. The hotel was self rated a 4 star hotel which was far from being one, closer to 3 star. Reception staff are not friendly if you ask them questions. Room is dated and very basic. We had twin bed in our room. Wi-fi is free but you can access it only after you are given your room. No complimentary bottle of water. No air conditioning, only heater and we have to leave our windows open so we won't sweat. Breakfast is free but the same food every day. Put the sign ""Do not disturb"" on the door but staff still came in when we were out. Nothing was missing but still not right to come in the room. I personally won't recommend this hotel."
2802,"It is a very nice hotel, situated in a very good location in Cannes. The room is lovely and very well organized. We arrived late due to a car issue -we informed them of course-and our room cards and everything we're waiting. The aged receptionist that had the night shift was extraordinary. He insisted on carrying our bags, on telling us everything about the city the hotel etc. and all that with a smile. If u read this my friend thank you. "
2803,"Petite lovely parisian hotel ... quiet and well situated. Nice renovated rooms, Terrace for summer reading or chilling out. Loved the homy feeling of breakfast with home made varieties of Jams (banana's, cardamon pears etc)"
2804,We picked a bad time to stay at this hotel. We were not advised before arriving of the works being carried out directly outside the hotel. The drilling started at 8:30 (earlier some mornings) until 4:40 every day except Sunday. The noise was horrendous we were unable to sit out on the balcony or open the patio doors.
2807,"The pictures look much better than the hotel. Old building with an updated depressing look. The colors of orange and brown don't do much for the mood. The bed spread had stains on it. It's right in the heart of the tenderloin so going outside of the hotel is creepy. Loud, smelly and definitely not 4 stars. There are much better options in the city than this."
2808,"stayed here feb 2012 .. i dont think will do it again. very old hotel , rooms small the hallway pretty dark,  for the same price you can get far better choices within the area. the only + part the staff much more helpful and amiable it was a relied."
2809,"I had reservations over 4th of July weekend.  When I walked in, an overwhelming mold odor hit me in the face.  There was one lady checking in for her group, she was arguing with the front desk clerk over her reservations and it took them over 20 minutes to get her situated.  She was upset because she booked the penthouse for her group and they were putting her in a small room with only one bed.  When it was my turn to check in, I had the same thing happen to me.  I was there with my family of 4 and we had booked a room with double beds.  They did not have any rooms available with double beds.  The only thing they could offer me was a small room with one single double bed.  There was no way we were paying to sleep on the floor of a run down, mold infested nightmare.  I asked to…"
2811,"There are many good things about this hotel. It's location, facilities, breakfast. The lobby is nice and promises much more. However it's rooms are probably the worst I've stayed in and not what I was expecting from a Sheraton. Mine was tired and dated which I can handle but it smelt musty and gave the impression of lacking cleanliness. The windows dirty, curtains shabby, carpet grubby and appeared unvacumed. The toilet seemed clean but mirror smeary, shower has sand in the corners and in a state of disrepair and the washing line all dotted with bits of mould. My safe was not working - out of battery and could not contact reception due to a faulty phone. The sheets dealt damp and duvet cover had some yellow marks on it. A great view from the balcony at least. I stayed in the…"
2812,Pick for its location between gothic quarter and the marina / beaches.  Room this time was a little basic; but clean; tidy and well provisioned.  Very friendly and helpful staff...  5-10 mins from marina 10-15 mins from the beach.  5 mins from gothic quarter.
2813,"This is a basic business hotel located in the business district and far from Amsterdam city centre. However, the hotel is about 100 m away from the tram station and tram no. 5 and 51 take you to Amsterdam Centraal in 30 mins. The neighbourhood is peaceful and safe.  The hotel is very basic (as are the other holiday inn express hotels across the world) with minimal service and amenities. Breakfast was decent, no hot food. They had a coffee machine in the lobby for use by the guests."
2814,"The location is pretty convenient. But the hotel but feels outdated and uncomfortable.  I just moved in and find my bathrobe and slippers to be dirty. That’s really strange… Of course everything was changed, but they didn’t even say sorry. It appeared that sound system won’t work with iPhone 7. It’s pretty cold inside the room, but conditioner is too noisy.  The in room dining is ok not great.  It seems like there’s not enough stuff in the hotel. Every time I went to the spa/swimming pool area it was really challenging to find anybody there. Swimming pool area is really cold, stem room didn’t work. And I am not really comfortable with people wearing their coats at the swimming pool area.  I also don’t like to have breakfast wearing my coat. But it’s too cold in the hotel.…"
2816,"We are here for a bachelorette party. We requested joined rooms and they don’t have any. We did finally get them to put our rooms on the same floor but we weren’t able to check into both rooms at 3:00 (check in time).  When we asked for champagne flutes to be delivered to the room they said they didn’t have any. I then asked for wine glasses, still don’t have any. Finally I asked for just standard water glasses. When she asked how many I needed (I said 7) they said they could only guarantee that 1 would be delivered (there are no glass cups in our room).    The staff isn’t rude but no one has made us feel welcome.   I will not be staying in this hotel again. "
2817,"Hotel looks way better on the outside than on the inside..while the staff of the hotel are very welcoming and helpful, it wasn't enough to make up for the fact that the sheets were dirty, the Air Conditioner was weak and shower curtains were stained brown. Not to mention that the entire curtain rod fell off the wall when we tried to draw the curtain and The hallways smell like smoke."
2818,For Marriott to change anything during this contract negotiation is ridiculous. Sort out you contact with your Labor otherwise your hotel is worthless. I was woken up incredibly early by protestors and I’m on the 7th floor. Not to mention them going late last nights. I’m supposed to be here tonight as well and needless to say I will be finding other accommodations. Truly absurd to think that this could be ok for guests during one of the largest corporate event weeks all year.
2820,"It was our first time in Madeira so with our holiday over I think the location was good.It looks good when you arrive ,quick check in . It states in the lift 6 people ,it also states 450 kgs that’s just over 11 and half stone  per person ...seriously ..its tiny . Rooms were a bit dated but clean . We were all inclusive food was ok . A wee tip can you please clean the white sun beds in the pool some of them have a green algae lin eon them ."
2821,"We are arrived in Eden Roc for the last week of our 3.5 week holiday in America; we had spent two weeks in California and this was our first stop in Florida.   We arrived at the hotel and there was little to no valet service, we waited for ages wondering what to do and where to leave the car - this should have been our first warning.   When we checked in I asked if we could have facilities or be given hot water for our baby’s bottle, we were told that it would cost us extra and come at a premium (this is the first time all holiday a hotel has said this - other hotels on our trip have been more than happy to do this and many have offered without being asked).   Likewise, all other hotels on this trip have said we can use the mini bar fridge to store our baby’s food and my…"
2822,"As this hotel is pretty new I assumed it would have air condtioning, it hasn't, my fault I should have checked the description better. It was extremely hot and humid when we arrived and uncomfortable sitting in the lounge because of the heat.We had to open all the bedroom windows wide to try and get some sleep and as our room overlooked the street we were plagued by the sounds of late night revellers wel into the small hours The positives as other contributers have commented the hotel is well situated, serves a good and varied breakfast and is probably the cleanest hotel I have ever stayed in. The bedroom was on the small side but well decorated with an efficient shower and comfotable bed which are the most important thiings in by book. I didn't like the combind lobby and lounge…"
2823,"Still waiting to check in after FIVE hours!  They claim the hotel’s computer system has been down for THREE days!  Customer service agents seem exhausted so I will give them a pass on how RUDE they are treating customers, but that doesn’t make it okay.  SOMEONE should have reached out to customers to let us know there was/is an issue.  No water offered; no drink coupons; NOTHING!  This is the absolute WORST Marriott experience.  I won’t ever return to this location.    Update: six hours later in a room different from what I reserved; chat and elite line useless.  Staying ONLY because the conference I’m attending is here."
2824,"I stayed here for 4 nights on a recent trip in December. The concept is pretty cool (everything being digital and hi-tech), but the automatic check in didn't work for me and I had to get my key bracelet thing reset 3 times during my stay. The hosts were very informative and helpful though. The lights inside the hubs were pretty cool as well as the bluetooth connections. Showers and bathrooms were very clean and nice (music, granite, rainfall showerhead). The location was also awesome - there was a farmers market literally right outside the hotel, and very close to convenient tram stops, shopping, and awesome food"
2827,"I spent one night in Club Quarters Hotel Chicago 06/30/2016 - 07/01/2016 in the room number 2414. I had checkout 07/01/2016 morning about 11am. After checkout I took with me all my staff, but unfortunately I forgot about my long sleeves shirt ($420) which I left in the closet. About 1pm I was near this hotel and asked in the reception about my shirt. The receptionist, his name was Seth, with smile answered me that they have another guest in this room and he can’t help me. I left my phone number for “Lost and found” department which exists in this hotel and representative told that they will call me. One week passed and I still hadn’t received any call or news about my shirt. I start call by myself trying find out what’s going on. I called them each day for one week and finally…"
2828,"Have just spent 4 nights at this hotel. A little out of the centre, but is in a nice residential area served by 2 Underground stations close by. We had a 1 bedroom suite with an nice little kitchen, we didn't use the facility, except to make coffee and to keep our drinks cool in the fridge. Bathroom was nice, and provided lots of storage space. Everywhere was very clean, but furnishings are looking a little dated. We were very glad of the air-conditioning as the temperature hit the mid 30c during our stay. The staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. We opted for breakfast and this was acceptable for the price we paid, but we did have to forego  one day (Sunday) as it was complete chaos with no tables available, the staff did set out tables in the courtyard but this…"
2829,"While I appreciate as an Accor member I can get an upgrade, I wasn't impressed with the stubborness of being 'upgraded' to a two bedroom apartment. Why? Because for one person for 1 night- yes, one night and travelling solo on business -  it is simply ridiculous to be in an apartment with 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a kitchen, lounge room etc! And, to top it off the apartment was pretty run down with the usual suspects of wear and tear and neglect showing.  I'm also beginning to wonder if some accommodations ever vacuum.   Perhaps, if I was in Melbourne for a few days, the Sebel apartments may, at a pinch, be suitable? But for a 1 night stay on business, I am sorry to say, I would not recommend."
2830,Motel refused to honor free breakfast  Included reservation made on hotel.com They told me to call hotel.com and sort it Out with them even after seeing breakfast Included on my reservation. So if you book on hotel.com be prepared for surprises. We will have to pay 120 euros extra for breakfast for 8 people of go out and have It On our own.   I had personally called hotel.com to make The reservation and mentioned to the agent that I had to have breakfast included In my hotel.
2831,The R hotel never mentions the $35.00 required parking fee when it advertises which I believe this hotel deceives the customers!!! Also the Asado Urban Grill inside the hotel is total ripped off. I ordered the fish and chips with a small salad and paid almost $45.00 including 18% tips. The food was sticky covered with strong oily and never fresh.  I stopped eating after couple of tastes. I wanted to complain about such a poor quality of food but tolerated.  I strongly recommend not to use this restaurant..NEVER!!!  
2832,"Arrived in the late morning to a warm welcome.  The staff gave me a snack, got my room ready, and carried my luggage up for me.  Lovely people, clean hotel, great location (close to the Gare Montparnasse train station, Pasteur metro stop, and good restaurants - just ask for recommendations at the front desk).  Nice rooftop lounge area, working wifi, tasty breakfast.  Would definitely stay here again."
2833,"The hotel location is a plus point! It’s very near the metro station so you could easily go to the tourist spots in Berlin. There’s a lot of restaurants and shops near by and the shopping street is a couple of minutes away the hotel, Kadewe shopping mall is just around the corner. The breakfast buffet was great. Couldn’t fault the staff. The only thing is the showerroom is very small. Overal we had a good stay."
2834,"We were at this hotel all of 10 minutes before I said to my partner “Let’s get out of here!” To which he did not need convincing. The receptionist was very understanding and agreed that we could leave without having to pay any cancellation fees since we had been there all of 10 minutes.  We were booked into room 101 the only room on the ground floor. Walking past the open laundry room and into what felt like a dungeon we open the door to be greated with plaster falling off the walls, Stains from god knows what all over the couch in the lounge room and mould in the bathroom.  I usually don’t put a bad review on trip advisor but I didn’t want anyone to have to visit this hotel if you could call it that. You leave feeling like you needed a tetanus shot. The neighbourhood was run…"
2835,"Although the hotel was comfortable and in a good location, I had a bad experience. During my stay I realized that several items of clothing went missing from my luggage. I'm certain they were not missing when I checked in. I informed the staff and unfortunately, they didn't resolve my issue and I didn't even receive a proper apology."
2836,"We stayed in a suite on the 18th floor. I expected a bit more attention to detail. The bathrobes and slippers were missing on our arrival to the suite. The minibar was free for suite guests, but it had only beverages and no food. The room has 2 plasma screen tv's, but the decor feels a bit outdated. I found a chunk of chocolate on the window of our room, from previous guests... Parking was free.  Check in was a bit chaotic, with lots of people in the check in area, with no apparent single file. Our 4 year old was given a key card (exclusive for kids) to the room, wich she enjoyed immensely. Breakfast is ok, but lacks a bit more variety (for example bread) for a 4 star hotel. The indoor pool is on the 19th floor and has a decent view of the city. The city center is a bit far…"
2837,Tax on the room was about $50/night and would be more on a more expensive room.  It is a very nice property but room rates quoted do not include taxes which are as high as I have seen.  People were very helpful and it is adjacent to the McCormick place which made it very convenient. 
2838,"So much potential, but wasted by poor management and uninterested staff.  Such a mixed review,  The Mercure Hotel & overall Sunword Bana Hills has a beautiful location with world class structures, designs and cable carts.  The ""french"" village is breathtaking and the numerous gardens have surgical precision.   The much hyped up ""Golden Bridge"" is also well built and provides excellent views on clear days.  Unfortunately thats where the good experience ends.  Check-in is a disaster with check-in staff uninterested, avoiding eye contact and we ended up waiting nearly 10 minutes for the 2 ladies to stop giggling on their smartphones and check us in.  There is a cost for hotel residents of 800k vnd to use the cable cart to get to your hotel (crazy i know)  2nd check-in is at the…"
2839,"We booked this hotel for its central location and convenient transport (tram, bus, subway). Besides the location, it provides a generous breakfast that starts as early as 6am, clean and functional rooms with a comfortable firm bed to crash into at night. Hotel is less than 3km from Brandenburg Gate so you can have a very pleasant 6k run passing many historic sights. "
2840,not recommanding you!! any hotel staffs dont have service mind and smile i ve met here dont expect welcoming smile  i thought this hotel is 5 star hotel taxi driver said to me this hotel was 5 stars but now is 4 stars hotel i think hardware is over 4 stars but software is below 3 stars !!!
2841,"If you are looking to party your brains out this is the perfect hostel for you.  If you are looking to sleep comfortably this is not the place.  The staff was super friendly and helpful at all times.  The breakfast was delicious and filling.  The location was great!  My only complaint was the noise. The lockers are squeaky and something needs to be done about that. Also we had some very rude roommates for 3 nights. These girls would come in and out of the room up until 4am and it seemed like they purposely talked and laughed as loud as they could. I know that this is not the hostels fault, they have no control over what kind of people they room you with. But maybe they can develop a survey that can be sent out to people who have reservations where they ask guests what their main…"
2842,Very expensive for the value. Air did not work. Regular check in is always a nightmare. Better get early to the gym - which is good - but always packed. Friendly staff. Small regular rooms. Executive Floors provide little benefits. Executive lounge is about the only thing that meets expectations. If I was not a Diamond Member I would never stay here.
2843,"We have stayed at Leonardo Royal Alexanderplatz twice & both times were super impressed by the exceptional customer service. We look forward to staying again next time we visit Berlin. Great location, lovely clean well appointed room. Great pillows."
2844,The mercure hotel is very close to airport with free shuttle and great little bar and restaurant. There is even a small pool and terrace area.  Best to take the shuttle to and fro as taxi wasn’t very happy with the short distance. Good option if you need to stay close to quiet 
2846,"There are several lounge space (nice Sofa and table) which can be used for business meetings for free. Not many people was used during my staying that hotel, so I didn’t need to make a reservation. And also, the staff were very friendly and very kind."
2847,"I have never bothered to leave a bad review for a hotel but it is most definitely warranted for this place.When we first arrived the staff member who checked us in was less than helpful and was actually quite rude. I had hoped that this was just a 1 off but it turned out that all the staff there were just the same, rude and useless.I asked if they could book us in a shuttle to the port at the end of our stay and they told us to book an Uber!The room itself was a decent size but was very dated and not very tidy and in addition there was a giant, noisy aircon unit in front of the window.The final straw came when the staff accidently checked someone else into our room and we had a stranger open our door at 4.30am whilst we were sleeping.We could not wait to get out of there and…"
2849,We stayed for 5 nights at the Furama in Danang. When we arrived it was perfect and we where feeling extremely welcome. The hotel has perfect facilities and everything is extremely clean.  The service of the hotelstaff is horrible and are not providing a 5 star service. Staff doesn't speak english and are not willing to help if there's a complaint.  For being one of the most expensive ressorts in vietnam they should give way better service.  It looks like staff doens't care if guests are enjoying there stay.
2850,"My colleague and I arrived at 6 in the morning, anticipating that we would have to leave our luggage and then go about our day until our rooms were ready that afternoon. To our pleasant surprise, one of the rooms was available and the staff member was happy to check us into it! Both rooms were elegantly decorated, clean, beautiful-- delicious caramel sablés left on the pillows, and coffee and tea available with a hot water kettle. My colleague's room (with one double bed) was quite tiny, but that is to be expected at boutique hotels in Paris; mine (with two single beds, because they didn't have another double available) was more spacious. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the location is great. Can't recommend it more."
2851,"The hotel is very nice, the rooms are nice but small. The hotel's breakfast room totally insufficient (7 tables) and the quality of the breakfast is very poor over the poor service. The front desk staff leaves much to be desired. Cleanliness is good and the location is great for exploring the city. For the same price, it gets better in the city."
2852,"Rooms are very clean. Location middle of fauburg, printemps, auber station, madeline station , st lazare station. Many asian food ,pizza and salad bowl store nearby. Good for luxury shopping. Always full so book early. Can keep stroller at lobby."
2853,"I spent almost a week at the hotel and had like 100 issues with the room access card and internet acces, every night, when I tried to access my room my card did not worked and every night I had to go to the reception to have it activated or changed, the same with the internet access, every day I had to ask to a new password and sometimes twice a day. Tried to take a immersion bath and the bathroom got flooded....sad... laundry service took two days to wash just two tshirs and two pants...."
2854,"Scandic Prince Philip / Best Western Plus Prince Philip in Skarholmen, Sweden is not ideally located as it is quite a distance from Stockholm. If travelers, however, have their own car, the hotel is a good alternative to uber-expensive hotels in the city as it is only about 15-20 minutes away from the capital. Our twin room is spacious, probably because of its rectangular shape. Bathroom is kinda small but functional. The breakfast spread is better than most hotels in similar category. The staff are pleasant and helpful and are always willing to lend a hand. Just across the highway, a sizeable mall is accessible through special walkway below the elevated highway."
2855,"I booked three nights in this hotel knowing it was cheap so didn't have very high expectations but I was in no way prepared for what I got. The hotel is extremely shabby apart from a cosmetic job on the reception area. It took twenty minutes to check in because the girl on the counter is so SLOW. The lift breaks down so often it's not worth trying to use it. The rooms are clean but the mattress is covered in plastic for some reason, not too easy to get to sleep. Especially with all the noise the many homeless people in the area make at night. The location might be convenient but it's not safe to walk around there after dark. The bathroom door handle fell off in my hands, the shower doesn't work, they advertise cable but you actually only get about 4 channels. Breakfast consists…"
2856,"Have read the various reports and was surprised at the poor, even rude in some cases, reception.  Found the owners very welcoming and helpful.  Room adequate, very clean and bright, satellite tv, but overlooking busy street and rooms are not double glazed so not good for light-sleepers.  In great location though, few minutes walk from marina, town centre, beach etc.  Continental breakfast included in price and good but coffee terrible as some have mentioned!  Probably wouldn,t stay again but we arrived in Lagos without reservations and this hotel was one with available rooms at a reasonable price so it was satisfactory for a short stay."
2857,"Run down, key features that could be very cool and hip are not working.  Staff is quick to pass the guest off to someone else, no one takes ownership if you can even get an employee to talk.  The hotel is a tourist turn and burn location check people our as fast as they can check them in.  No food/beverage on the property, guests have to go to nearby outlets in the Waterfront area.    Poor Customer Service, run-down - In reality, not what is promoted."
2858,"My family and I stayed are currently staying here for a total of 6 nights. We booked our rooms (one twin and one king config) online about 3 months ago through the Marriott website and are also reward members, which allows you to access wifi for free.  We arrived at the hotel at 12pm and was told our rooms were not ready, that check-in was normally at 2pm, and recommended we have lunch nearby. This was fine for us as we were all hungry. We got back at 2pm and our rooms were ready at 230pm.  Pros - The rooms and bathrooms are nice itself - clean and comfortable bed (however they use odd shaped square-ish big pillows). Good location, walking distance to shops and public transport, english speaking staff, nice gym and quiet pool (apparently because there was an accident last year…"
2859,"Le Robinet d'Or is an excellent choice for a pleasent and comfortable staying in one of the most charming arrondissements in Paris, the 10ème. Rooms are clean, spacious, air-conditioned and offer a small kitchen for quick meals. Perfect for families. Fresh water and coffee are free for guests. Breakfest is delicous and the management team is friendy and competent. It would be great to come back in our next visit to Paris."
2860,"I'm writing this review at 2AM because it is impossible to sleep.  There is significant road noise and noise from people outside my room.  The room is comfortable and very nice looking and for the low price ($55) it would have been perfect.  However, the noise negates all the positives I have for this room."
2861,"As a Marriott Titanium member, I am thankful for the kind courtesies accorded always. But this time, my wife and I were blown away by Alix, the young lady who checked us in.  Alix was charming and kind. In the middle of a busy afternoon check-in time, she found it in her to smile and even found room options for us to view -- including an upgrade! Her boss - the front desk manager - was equally kind, with a sense of humor (my apologies for forgetting her name).   Thank you Alix. For not only your smiles and your kindness checking us in, but also for checking in on us throughout our stay!"
2863,The theme of the hotel is music / bands. It is a very cool concept and you can tell that the designers have put thought into the layouts and decor of the hotel.   PRO: - large room with nice sitting area by the window.  - Easy to get to Centraal. - Saunas were nice  CON: - Breakfast was incredibly disappointing as the scrambled eggs was like rubber (overcooked) and I had to wait 30 mins for an omelette (and I stopped waiting).  - No swimming pool or punching bag in the gym. - There was always a queue at reception and the queue for hot food for breakfast was unbelievably long!  - The guy who ordered his omelette after me walked away with MY order whilst I had to wait another 30 mins for mine. I was on a business trip and the wait was just ridiculous! - Food choices were terrible…
2864,"For the price I really expected more, I've stayed in several Amsterdam hostels and this was the one I was most disappointed by. It was one of the cleaner, more presentable ones, it just didn't meet my expectations. What really annoyed me was there wasn't any soap in the bathrooms so I had to find other places just to wash my hands. There was also a big fluctuation in how friendly and efficient the staff were. Luckily it wasn't an issue for me, but this was the first hostel where the lockers were not big enough for a large rucksack or small suitcases (essentially most carry-on, which is what most travellers use) so the others in my room had to trust that no one would steal them."
2866,"Good location near Passeig de Gracia, very close to the R2 North train to the airport (1 euro). Excellent staff – went out of their way to ensure we had the best choice of rooms prior to arrival, and went out of their way to help once we arrived. Buffet breakfast was first rate – great selection  in a comfortable room Rooms are decorated in a very modern style – I liked it, my wife not so much; they are on the small side with very limited counter space to put stuff down on. In our room the bathroom sink was in the bedroom.  As we all strive to save energy the lighting was very dim, combined with small windows and dark furniture made for a very dark room. Common to most hotels in central Barcelona noise is an issue – in this case partygoers stumbling home late and crashing around…"
2867,"My kids and I had 3 rooms in this hotel, for 3 nights. My room was near a stairwell and I could hear lots of thumping etc. throughout my stay. The bed was comfy and the rooms felt very safe.   There is a really nice breakfast that comes with the rooms and we partook twice. The feeling of the guests at breakfast was a bit older and honestly a bit snooty. No young people and for sure not a hip scene.   The rooftop bar is awesome. We went twice for light food and wine. The view is gorgeous and the staff is super. 5 stars for the rooftop bar!  The service at the desk was meh. We quickly got the feeling that they didn’t care at all about us. They would direct us to go to the bar if we asked for more water to be brought. They reprimanded my daughter for putting her hotel key next to…"
2868,"The staff was really helpfull and friendly. The hostel is well situated in the Barra area: a 2min walk from the beach and a 5min walk from the Barra lighthouse, which offers a great view.  Unfortunately the infrastructure of the hostel wasn't good, the rooms were very small and quite dirty and the furniture and matrasses were really old. The bathroom was separated with a plastic foldable door which didn't offer much privacy and the water in the shower was cold. We stayed 2 nights for a very good price, so we didn't really complain, but a few improvements could make this hostel really great!"
2871,"The room was beautiful, the breakfast delishious and the staff were kind, friendly and very helpful. The location was fantastic because it is close to a number of metro stations. My daughter and I enjoyed ourselves and would love to come back again."
2872,We stay here for 1 week the room are small but really do we need large room this was a  perfect location and everything was funky. Fun decoration bed was very comfortable all toiletries were first class staff was all helpful and Pleasant breakfast was perfect fresh coffee  juices croissants eggs  salmon cereal etc  even chocolate covered rice cakes perfect for gluten free and very nice young lady’s that are theres the help you  This is a perfect location for the right bank Gallery Lafayette The Louvre Museum Opera!!with lots of restaurant near  
2873,"I had seen this hostel online and thought it looked fantastic. We were traveling to multiple cities in Brazil and decided to ""splurge"" and stay at Bee W in the Pop Art Suite, instead of a shared room and even though it was more expensive than other available options.   Overall, I was very disappointed and wouldn't stay there again.   The hostel is relatively new and (at first glance) the suite looked great.  However....   -The suite has a wooden slatted window which doesn't close completely (broken?), letting air, light, and LOTS of noise in. The hostel in general is VERY loud (probably the loudest of all the hostels we stayed in) and it always sounded like someone was about to walk into our room -- maybe understandable for a dorm, but not very good for relaxing in a private…"
2874,"We (my wife and I, four nights) really enjoyed our stay at this hotel.  The location was excellent for visiting the sites.   The room was spacious, clean and well appointed, and the staff was exceptional.  We used the concierge/main desk repeatedly for meal and site suggestions and they were helpful and spot on with advice.  We specifically want to thank Angelica for service above and beyond with a smile.  We wholeheartedly recommend this hotel and, because of our excellent experience, will look at other H10 properties for other trips."
2875,"Great location opposite Hauptbahnhof central station. Surprisingly given the location we found our room very quiet. Decent room size with very comfy bed. Bathroom a bit small and shower above bath not brilliant. Large selection at breakfast but for a non meat eater would have like to have seen some fish. Food not replenished enough. Also would have been nice to have pastries there, only saw croissants on a couple of days as again they didn't replenish. Staff seemed very helpful. Would definitely recommend."
2876,"I was only here because it was where we were going to meet up with a cruise to Antarctica that ended up being cancelled at the last minute. The room was shabby, there wasn't anyone to help with bags, housekeeping failed to show up on 2 out of 3 days, only one of the 3 elevators worked, wifi disconnected constantly, they were very skimpy on towels and didn't have a concierge.  I've stayed at other NH properties and never saw them as being ""luxury"" level but this wasn't even worthy of 3 stars."
2877,"If you need a bed to sleep in, a good hot shower, and put cleanliness of the room at a premium (this was cleaner than our experience of many higher end hotels--kudos to the staff), but no extras, this may be the hotel for you. Similarly, if you are not concerned about security issues, except that perhaps you want a step above a hostel, this is a good choice for a hotel.  What you will not get are: -a secure door to the room: a five-year-old could kick it in. There was no bolt whatsoever. -a safe -lotion in the bathroom (there was a blowdryer, however) -washcloth -extra blankets when it is unseasonably cold, which was the case for us. The room had no heat."
2879,"Just can't sleep at this hotel.  This was our last stay.  We've stayed four times in the past two years and the outcome is always the same.  Too much darn noise on the streets, can't sleep."
2880,Excellent for couples. Room was spotless. Staff couldnt do enough to make our stay enjoyable.champagne and flowers in our room was a nice idea  and scored me extra brownie points ha.  Highly recommend. And would stay again. Thanx to everyone at hotel.  
2881,"I stayed at the Westin for four nights because I was attending a close by conference and it has been the worst experience ever. Staff was on strike and our room was not made during our stay but the worst was that our room was close to the street were the pickets were yelling until midnight and starting at 5 a.m, so could not sleep either. This was not well handled since nobody notified us of the strike and I assure you this is not a cheap hotel. Not going back-"
2883,"My husband and I just spent 10 wonderful days in Paris at the Wilson Opera. From the very early morning arrival to our departure, we were treated like family. Nour took care of our luggage and insisted we enjoy breakfast before we headed out into the city. Our room was lovely, comfortable and the bathroom was spacious. Hakim graciously welcomed us each morning for a delicious breakfast of fresh fruit, yogurts, wonderful pastries, fresh orange juice and fresh eggs to soft boil. No matter when we came or went, we usually had questions about tickets, directions, or suggestions for restaurants. All were answered so wonderfully by the amazing staff!  The location near the Lazare station made getting all over Paris so simple, and for a quick walk home after very long days site seeing.…"
2884,The hotel is located right next to the beach. Even from our 1.floor room we could see the waves and hear the ocean. The pool area is nice and bigger than it seems on the pictures. There are a couple of roof terraces all with a great view. The room itself is spacious and the beds are great even though there are two single-beds no doubles. Uninspired decor and furniture with two desks and a tiny TV with fake wooden floor. There is a fridge but no minibar. The room also lacks ironing and coffee making facilities. The staff is friendly especially the cleaning staff but front staff could be more service minded. You don't choose this hotel for its breakfast. The coffee could easily win the award for the worst coffee on the whole of Madeira island. There are plenty of choices but the…
2887,"We very much enjoyed our stay at  Sixtytwo Hotel from May 11-13.  The room was very clean and modern.  The staff was very helpful in securing reservations for La Sagrada Familia and the Palace of Catalan Music which we thoroughly enjoyed. The location was great. The Metro and taxis were very close by. The Passeig De Gracia was beautiful and very convenient to all sights.  The breakfast was plentiful and delicious.  Thanks for the complimentary bottle of Cava which we enjoyed later on our cruise. We are two seniors who are in very good health, however the height of the bath tub was difficult for us to climb over. There was no storage under the sink.  The terrace room was very nice but you had to descend about three steps without a railing to get to the outdoor table and chairs. …"
2888,Amazing location just behind Madeleine metro and a short walk from the opera. The  hotel is new with spacious and airy rooms. the choices of restaurants are mind boggling with large numbers of Japanese and Vietnamese eateries all around and a very good selection of brasseries and bistros very nearby as well. Also very convenient for ahopping:
2889,"When I checked in to my room, it wreaked of urine. After a of couple calls to the manager and two visits from the care taker I was given a new room. No upgrade, no apology, nothing. The new room had a broken a/c and wouldn't cool down. When checking out the staff could given a care about the room. When I mentioned that I couldn't get the room to cool down, all I got was ""oh, that's too bad"". "
2890,The hotel was decent with all the required facilities but just needs some refurbishment. Great location and close to bus and metro stations. Good for a mini break with family but don't expect total luxury but for the price paid it's not bad. Request room on top floor and to the back to escape the busy road outside 
2892,"First off, do not bother trying to order a cocktail at the bar in the lobby or the other bar - they were all terrible and we needed to send it all back. I dont think the staff actually new what Margaritas or Mojitos were! In the lobby bar, I tried ordering a TWG green tea instead and they gave me a Dilmah green tea - 'by mistake'. As if I wouldn't notice!! There is a huge price difference..I thought this was really shady. Service in general was poor, staff did not speak English well at all, I tried to order Cornflakes for breakfast but room service couldnt understand, despite me pointing out where on the menu they could find it. On another occassion, a staff member opened my door despite me having the 'do not disturb' sign on the front of my door!! Location is also in the middle…"
2893,"This hotel is high end 5 star.  Everything is of a very high quality, service, bedrooms and standards.  Our room was overlooking the back of the hotel so wasn’t a sea view but that’s ok. We hardly were in the room much. It is directly across from the beach. But it is a very expensive place. We didn’t use the private beach or eat in the hotel as the price is very high.   But for a beach front property you cannot get much better.  Look out for sales as this is how we managed to afford here. Usually in high season very expensive   But all in all an excellent hotel!"
2894,"We stayed as a family with 2 kids for 6 nights. The service was excellent and staff very attentive and helpful as many have mentioned and they do really help. The entire staff from breakfast, cleaning and reception were fantastic and made you feel welcomed indeed.  Good points: close to tram station and shops, well stocked supermarket and a few good restaurants with a great Japaneses rest called Kagetsu directly across on the opposite side of tram station. Also a great community centre comprising of cinema, large shopping centre, library, kids playground, farmers market at the end stop Amstelveen in the opposite direction away from Amsterdam Central. We easily spent a day here and it was so pleasant to be in a local environment without the crowds.  The breakfast selection was…"
2895,"Beautiful building. Staff in bar, restaurant and reception very helpful and friendly. Hotel needs updating without losing its vintage appeal. Housekeeping management needs to keep a check on room cleanliness from ceiling to floor weekly to maintain its 5 star status."
2896,"Before I bash this hotel let me start with the greats.  1. the people, every staff member I ran across was amazing and sweet. 2. The food, it was great, tasty and fresh.   But the price point of the hotel does not match the level of amenities in the rooms. No phone in rooms (text only), so guess what if you're a non-euro resident they can't text you FAIL 1,  No ice or cute in-room food like At6ix (which is secretly the same hotel).  So guess what, its a busy bar you have to stand in line a wait just for ice or soda, what a pain.  Fail 2.   Fail 3 in efforts of overly trying to be cool there are no Irons in the room, only a communal really nice irons in the basement.  Here is why that sucks. 1 in the morning you have to get fully dressed in clothes that your not gonna were for…"
2898,"I've had the pleasure of staying at many JW Marriott's around the world, from Seoul to Dubai and throughout the U.S. For the most part, my experience  at JW properties have been pleasant.   On a positive note,  JW Marriott in Chicago is in a great location. It's it walking distance to the river walk, restaurants, shopping, Michigan Ave., State St. etc.   Valet parking is $68 per night.  You can park in a garage nearby for about $45 per night.  Had I known this in advance, I would have just turned in my rental earlier and Uber'd around town.   I looked forward to staying here in Chicago, but the excitement wore off soon after check-in. Upon check-in, the receptionist was very unwelcoming and unprofessional. 1. She did not acknowledge my Marriott gold status or offer any upgrades.…"
2899,"We stayed at Ibis Porto Centro for two nights in August, and were pleasantly surprised. The hotel feels slightly odd to begin with, above a large shopping mall about 15 minutes walk uphill from the main tourist areas. The reception is on the third floor, accessed by anyone, by lift. Security concerns are answered by the fact that your residents' room key is needed to get to any of the residential floors, above. Reception were very helpful, both on arrival and then when we wanted to leave bags for a few hours after checking out.  Our room was small, clean, the beds were very comfortable. The towels were slightly old and worn - but clean, and did the job.  The air conditioning worked well. We did not have breakfast here, but chose to walk and have coffee and croissants etc in one…"
2901,"The problem with expectations are that they are inevitably dashed... as were mine on day two of our stay at this resort. The grounds are beautifully landscaped, the pool clean but the beach was a major disappointment.  There were dozens of fishing boats (I think) so water wasn't pristine and the huts at the beach were on the dunes instead of on the beach, which wasn't helpful as kids mostly wanted to be on the sand, digging or building castles. The pool area was clean, looked out to nicely manicured lawns, but didn't have nearly enough lounge chairs pool side for the guests. Breakfast was adequate - if you're adventurous and don't mind sampling local cuisine. But if not, you're stuck with mediocre bread rolls and deli meats. The location is not ideal as it's not close to the…"
2902,"Friendly porters, helpful at reception,close to the old city. So far so good. The killing thing is a room facing the inbound and outbound traffic of Lisbon airport. Double glazing does not help. Being a spotter it was both nice and disturbing so when you book a room, make sure it is on the sea side. The building as such is 70’s and so is the inside. The stairway smelled like my grandma lived there. Enough nagging, the hotel is ok for a rate of max 200 a night. But for 500? No way you should spent your money here. "
2903,"Never managed to stay here, however this company cancelled my booking without warning or any communication at all, i deliberately booked so far in advise to get a spot and in budget, then i had to try find somewhere else to stay which was much more expensive "
2904,"The hotel is fine for business, but I wouldn't recommend it for a family as you are a bit of a walk from the city center.  The rooms are a bit dated and blah.  Our double room had two twin beds, made up as 2 twin beds which means there was a gap between the mattresses.   The fitness facilities are pretty basic and you have to provide an email or a Facebook account for their 'free' internet.  The breakfast buffet is a nice spread though."
2905,"The second-floor room I stayed in was in bad shape - chipped tub, moldy shower head, furniture scuffed, neither updated nor maintained. Terrible view of machinery between two sides of the building. Also, no closet (?!) or place to store/hang clothes - a first for me. All for over $600/night. It felt more like a two-star hotel than a 4-star. I stay in SF in the same rough area a few times a year for conferences, so I'm familiar with standards and prices for other hotels in the area."
2906,"I visited Lisbon a lot , this was my first time in this hostel . The hostel is located close to the Metro, on a verry good location to visit the city ! A lot of noice in the night on the street , use earbuds . There is an elevator , and 24h permanency . The staff is correct , but no more than that . The breakfast was verry poor  , and don't expect flexibility . They are standing near to you to check if you do the dishes ...but they won't help you (I recommend the staff to act more chill , and help). The toilets and showers are cleaned regulary , the rooms only before you arive , not during your stay (we recommend the staff to clean the garbage can every day during the stay) . They airco is switched off when you are not there , so when you get back your room is verry hot (we…"
2907,"Stayed here with my sister last week. It is a very basic hotel. Rooms are small but clean. Mostly well equipped. No fridge in room. It is in a good location, about 20mins walk from the centre of Lagos, and right beside Dona Ana beach. The breakfast is very basic. If you want somewhere as a base for the many activities in Lagos it is good. Wouldn't recommend it for anyone who likes to spend a lot of time at their hotel.  "
2908,Very nice stay in paris. Clean and confortable hotel in a quiet street.Nice and friendly staff. good underground communication. Breakfast is also quite enough. If I come back to Paris again I'll definitely choose this hotel.
2912,"1 block from metro station, which by the way connects perfectly with most attractions. Plenty of restaurants around the area. We could walk to the shopping area in Montparnasse. Lovely breakfast with insane homemade  mermelade! Rooms have amazing shower. Terrace on top floor is also very cosy, to read a book enjoying the sunny weather. We will definitely come back!"
2913,on the paper the hotel is a 5 star. I don't know how the stars have been allocated. The service is very poor. At reception you have only one person to answer all questions and it takes some time to check in or check out. We tried the restaurant and we wait one hour before to ear that we had to wait again as they were busy nevertheless we were second to be seated. The other tables were served before. Guys were looking at tv instead to take care of you and the kitchen was obliged to call them by phone to make sure they were coming to pick up plates. We left the restaurant without eating and they didn't care at all. Room was clean but bathroom was quite old. Could be rated at 3 stars. I ordered a car to go to the airport and there was a mess with the driver who came back after a…
2914,"Hotel clean but very dated. No comfortable seating in social areas. Staff could do with customer care course! Not many Brits so staff seamed to ignore us!! Entertainment repeated same songs, even with a different artist !  Might seam that I'm moaning but there is a certain standard that you expect when the Hotel rates itself as a 4*."
2915,"It is always a pleasure to stay here. Staff is nice, professional, helpful and happy. Will come again. The location is excellent - right next to Jardin de Luxembourg. Great for a walk or run - before a nice restaurant later (also in walking distance)."
2916,"We stayed for 2 nights, the rooms are really nice and a good size. Location is good. The reason for the 3 stars is the staff. Check in was so slow, the restaurant was disorganized and slow and the bar staff were really rude and made us feel like we were an inconvenience to them. I wouldn’t stay at this hotel again.  The other thing, not that it really mattered but the wine list had one red, one white and one sparkling to choose from.   "
2917,"Hotel Nicolass Witsen is located in a really nice part of Amsterdam and is a good base to enjoy the city.  We stayed for 6 days and while we were happy enough with the hotel it was a little let down by the room.  We stayed in room number 2 (a family room for 3) which is located at the back of the hotel which turned out to be a bit gloomy and felt 'damp'.  There is very little natural daylight in the room (the windows are blocked by a neighbour's fence) and it isn't well ventilated.  We suspect that room number 3 will be similar as it is also set in the back of the hotel and is also blocked in by tall buildings to the rear.  On the plus side, the staff at the hotel were very helpful and the rest of the public areas were fine, it is well kept and the housekeeping service was…"
2918,"While the room itself was clean and comfortable with a fantastic view, the other amenities such as pool beds, were old and truthfully a bit smelly. The hotel bar lacks personality and the sports bar staff on duty to little to amplify this.   Reception staff were basic, about 50% of them were polite and attentive and the other half seemed put out by our attendance and/or requests. Requests included a ‘please can you send accomodation staff to turn down our room’ at 2pm, FYI.   About half the staff were professionally dressed and the other half in tee shirts which is a bit lax and casual on first impressions, particularly for what claims to be a 4 star hotel. Perhaps they were tired (of westerners?!) at the end of the Christmas season which was no doubt very busy.   The ‘private’…"
2919,"I'm a repeat guest and I love the comfort, convenience and service at this hotel.  I've just experienced one problem, the cash machine in the lobby uses outrageous rates for currency conversion.  Do Not use this machine.  "
2920,"I'm going to give an honest and informative review here...There was a lot of stuff I loved about the hotel and a lot of stuff I didn't.  AT A GLANCE The hotel was inexpensive, modern and well-kept (in terms of the building, exteriors etc.) and I would probably stay there again if I'm being honest. The hotel had a lively feel to it. I wouldn't recommend it to any older couples or families. The average age of the residents was about 24. We were a young couple so didn't bother us.   LOCATION The hotel is quite a bit out from the town centre but the transport links directly outside the hotel makes travelling no problem at all. You can get the Tram (no. 13) straight to central and it only takes 20 minutes. There is also the Metro (M) which is like 5m from stepping out of the hotel…"
2921,"The location is good, 5-10 minutes walking from Alexandra place. You can travel everywhere from Alexandra Place.   The room is clean, the bathroom is nice.  Underground parking place. It was a good choice to live there.   There is an unexpected think happen when i lived in this hotel with my boyfriend. His car run out of power, because we let some light on. We asked if the hotel could help somehow. They never met such thing before.  Finally we called taxi to help. It was kind of interesting experience, even it was not fun at all back then."
2923,"When looking for something a bit different t we came across the Amstel Botel.   It is different, cabins are pretty cosy, breakfast is chaotic but worth the effort. Staff are very helpful.  The Botel is very close to the free ferry in to Amsterdam city. The ferry is frequent throughout the day."
2924,"This was the fourth time we have stayed here.  There has always been a warm welcome from the staff and they will do their best to answer questions and accede to requests.  The rooms are average size , for Paris, but perfectly adequate.  Breakfast buffet is good."
2925,"We visited Lisbon for a short weekend break and chose to stay at the Borges Chiado primarily for it location. The location is definitely this hotels strongest point, being right in the centre and literaly 20m from one of the major Metro stations, meaning it is only 25 minutes and €1.50 metro ride from the airport. Our room was clean but was a little cramped especially the bathroom, but we did book a basic room, other room types were much bigger. It was however very clean and secure. The staff were helpful and efficient. Our room rate included breakfast, which was not particularly good so if an option do not take it as there are 2 excellent cafes either side of the hotel. So not perfect but great value for the location and convenience."
2926,"Room rate for a deluxe ocean view: 4 stars for space, cleanliness, comfy.  Resort pool: 4 stars for nice design, and cleanliness. Beach site: 3 stars for the view, not pleasant to go under for wavy. Food: 0, waiter/waitress has no adequate prior training, dishes are inconsistent in quality, taste, ingredient and size. Serving time is long. Overall: 2 stars, many bugs after rain...  "
2927,"First time in Berlin and it couldn't be any better with the stay with Adina! Fabulous location, modern facilities and fast internet - I couldn't ask for more! The breakfast is very generous as we got coffee served to the table! The sauna and jacuzzi also is a plus as we had to stay in house for an afternoon cause there was a storm passed by - we did have a great time at the jacuzzi!  The studio we have is spacious with nice kitchen equipment. You can tell the hotel cares for the environment as well from bathroom products that they use, which is very nice thing to see. And the bed! Super comfy and great size!  Overall, very satisfied with my stay with Adina hotel! Thanks team!"
2928,"We enjoyed 7 days April 26 to May 3rd 2017 in this wonderful hotel.  The room and bathroom very clean and nice.  The classic rooms are small but still comfortable enough for two people.  We stayed in Room 401 which had a window looking to the front of the hotel.  It was very nice to look out to see how the weather was etc.    The staff is excellent very professional, friendly and eager to help with anything you need.  Special thanks  to Aurelia for all her mornings help with directions and metro information. She was outstanding ! Also, Matthieu, Emmanuel and Alain were wonderful always very helpful in anything that we needed and even gave us some lessons in basic french phrases which we used constantly in our trip.  We felt like  we were family !! The location of the hotel is…"
2929,Stayed here for two nights after getting off Eurostar at the Gare du Nord. It’s just across the road.  Very friendly helpful staff.  Lovely eclectic quiet room on 5th floor.  Very pleasant bar and great food in the restaurant.
2930,This used to be a cheap rooming house in the past . But over the last few years it became a tiny hotel on Folsom street right in the middle of a busy and noisy neighborhood . With a bar & a bakery shop downstairs plus all that one one way street traffic outside of your window .The quality of this place just isn't much better than the olden days that it was a old dumpy building from the 1930 - 1970 era days of a cheap one night stand rooming house . The old rates of $ 20.00 a night still should be in place . Its not worth any more . The sheets in the bed are stained and smell funny . The walls of the room look dismal and cheap .The wood work around the door has 50 coats of paint along with the doors too . The carpets in the gall are old and tired . This place is still the same as…
2931,"We chose this hotel by default as it was between Kings Day and Liberation Day so hotels in Amsterdam were well booked.  It served our purpose, but lacked any charm. It is steps from the train station and a small grocery store (Spar) which was convenient.  The front desk employees were helpful but unsure of certain services which brought us some stress. We also had issues with the our room cleaning.  It was comfortable and quiet sleeping and served its purpose as a place to rest after a long day of travel."
2932,"The staff was polite and friendly,the Hotel rooms are clean and very comfortable!The hotel is near to Metro,train station and Mall and you can even walk to some sights!Thers is also a bar that you can enjoy a coffee or drink before you go out."
2933,Stayed for four nights in early March with my brother in a twin room. The hotel is located ideally on La Ramblas (which BTW is very touristy and not classy) so it is well placed for walking around city. The room was really funky but didn’t like the internal location which made it feel dark and a little bit claustrophobic. The toilet seat was unusually high and strange! The rooftop pool was cool but incredibly small and wouldn’t be any good at all to swim in! Otherwise the rooftop was nice and offered  good views of La Ramblas and the city. All the staff were very friendly and happy to help. Didn’t eat or drink here so can’t comment on that aspect.  Overall it was a great stay and would recommend your try it.
2934,"We arrived yesterday with my girlfriend to spend 4 days at this hotel. I have to say  our first impression was great. Big nice reception with a nice bar, very friendly concierge explaining us details. Everything sounded perfect. We were very excited to throw our luggage in the room right away and run to the pool, specially because it had been raining every day in Rio since we arrived and it was our first sunny day. We had seen pictures of the pool and the nice terrace and views! So the first question my girlfriend asked was which floor the pool was and the concierge answered ""it s on the 14th floor but today you won't be able to use it. There's a private event starting at 2pm (it was around 1pm).  We couldn't believe our ears! I come to a nice hotel in summer, on holidays, on a…"
2935,"Great hotel and breakfast but very unfortunate the noise from other hotel guests, walking around in their rooms above you. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Only the noise from hotel guests is disturbing."
2937,"I went to the front desk today to request an additional room. The front desk informed me they are unable to assist with adding an additional room as the booking is under corporate rate. They insisted that I book through my travel agent. I asked why I was not able to book directly, they then suggested I should email the reservation department. I asked if I could call them to make a booking. They said they insisted on an email. I asked if the only way to book at this hotel is by email. Front office said, even if I called they would still require an email. I requested if I could speak to the front office manager, they went to the back and she refused to come out to entertain my request. I insisted to speak to the reservation department and suggested I could always confirm via email…"
2938,"This was our 3rd stay at the Calma Berlin Mitte. We enjoyed it like the times before. The Hotel is located in the Centre of Berlin close to the “Friedrichstraße” and “Oranienburger Tor” Public Transport - “U-and S-Bahn” are in walking distance. The Hotel rooms are spacious and clean, the staff is friendly and the breakfast is really good. We’ll definitely will come back."
2939,One of the nice hotel in Barcelona... Rooms were cleaned. Hotel staff was very polite and helpful... Necessary amenities in the room.. Toiletries provided... The rooms were spacious... Food was very delicious and lots of variety in food... Overall a nice and enjoyable stay in hotel...
2940,"I am here in for the second day.  The room does not live up to my expectation.  I have been waiting for clean water to take a bath for more than 45 minutes after returning from a whole day out.  The water is reddish brown, with dirty particles.  When I called the reception, I have been told to run the tap for 5 minutes, but the water has kept running for 45 minutes (I feel guilty for wasting the water) and it is stil dirty.  I rang the reception again, and was told that they will see what they can do!   Last night, the water in thge tub did not drain and we had to call for help.    Location wise, its convenient but the hotel is far below my expectation for the price we paid.  I cannot see why one would want to pay a premium simply because the building is 2 centuries old."
2941,"I don't often stay in the middle of Paris when I visit, but I'm glad that I tried out this hotel. The location was great, so easy to walk to many incredible locations, or a quick walk to a metro station and then the whole city is close. The staff was helpful, nice, and informative, the rooms were clean, and it was an overall very nice stay."
2942,"Amazing decor and atmosphere - I would totally recommend. It seemed quite camp and busy, so not the place for a demure weekend.. more fun and lively, but the rooms and quiet and cosy and we slept well!"
2943,"This was an absolute disappointment on every level. After believing the hype, we booked this ""boutique"" hotel for an outrageous price.  The property is dated, across the street from a collapsing building, the rooms are super small, ill equipped and with no sound protection from the rooms on either side.  The staff, while friendly, attempted to charge for everything, including hot water for tea - reminding me there were two ""free"" coffee pods in my room and a late checkout (1 pm = half a day's rate).  The cleaning team came between 4:30 and 6 pm in the evenings, so the rooms were not made up all day.  The beach ""across the street"" is about 5 blocks away on a shared beach with run down chairs where they offer you an umbrella or more for - you guessed it - an additional fee. You…"
2944,"The best thing this place has going is it's location to the beach and it's local restaurants.   The staff had very little English. The entire hotel smells funny and our room smelled of damp. The breakfast isn't great either.   The pool was a joke. Dangerous slippy surfaces all over. I wouldn't feel safe having children there. Day 1-4 construction building site, drilling  with dust flying all over the place. This also started at 7:30 and we could hear it in our bedroom 4 flora down.  I'd skip this place, spend a little more money and you will find something better. "
2945,"A large range of breakfast, tasty foods. Comfortable beds. Liked the coffee and tea. Very motivated staff who are always wanting to help you. There ac works properly. Rooms are really clean with comfy beds and clean sheets. Location is good easy to find easy to go to the places."
2947,"We arrived early in the morning and the lady who checked us in wasn't really smiling/welcoming. She didn't give us any information about the breakfast, the internet etc.... The man we met when we came back at night to get the keys was nice tho ! I think breakfast was just ok regarding the choice. The fruits were excellent ! It can get pretty busy tho so dont go too late.... On the second day, while we were leaving to get dinner out, we asked the lady at the front desk (a blond one) to fix the curtains, she said there was nobody to do it (which I understand because it was ""late"") but semeed to be in hurry to return to the phone call she was having (which I think was not a professional one). The room was nice, pretty spacious, not noisy at all, air conditionning working perfectly…"
2948,"This is a beautifully appointed hotel, with a charming, helpful staff. Pauline and Alexandra went out of their way to make our stay a pleasant one. Both speak excellent English. The hotel is ideally located near the Nation Metro station, which served as a perfect jumping-off place for our travels in and around Paris. And as Cole Porter would say, the Hotel du Prince Eugene is ""so nice to come home to."" The neighborhood abounds with little cafes as well as larger restaurants and bars, but it has a friendly, safe vibe. Crank open the window in your room to revel in the sights and sounds of Paris..."
2950,Kamari is a nice place to stay location-wise but after the other hotels we stayed at in Athens and Mykonos in the same price range this place was a little bit of a disappointment.  Good-- Breakfast was great with a lot of the variety.  The pool area is nice.  They have a nice beach front lounging area.  It is near the bus stop and the bus system is great.  Bad-- The breakfast was only served from 0730-1000.  The pool was closed every day at 6 PM.  The Wi-Fi was slow.  The bed was firm.  The A/C units were loud.  We had an issue with one of the showers in the room flooding the bathroom and all the way into the bedroom.  When I contacted the front desk about it I was told that housekeeping would clean it up.  I couldn't get them to understand there was a reason why it flooded.  We…
2953,"What a lovely hotel a short metro journey from central Paris. Stayed in a superior double for three nights. The attention to detail in this hotel is fabulous. Bed, bedding, in room refreshments, choice at breakfast, cutlery, decor etc. Friendly staff. Great location with lots of restaurants nearby. Yep you can hear the metro but that’s because is so close and therefore convenient. It didn’t bother us. Would definitely stay here again . "
2954,"The hotel has a superb position close to many restaurants, shops, and bakeries.  It's very easy to access public transportation from there.  I really loved provided professional services and their comprehensive approach to a guest's needs."
2955,"I personally didn't have many negative things to say about this hotel, the room was very nice and clean, updated, good TV, decent view nothing special. The only thing I'd say is wrong with the place is the EXTREMELY small elevator they have to go up to your room but besides that it's a very quiet and nice hotel i would stay here again. The staff was alright and i never ate the food there so I'm not sure if it's good or not."
2956,"Just about to check out after three fantastic nights at the Marriott. Staff have been friendly and helpful from the start, with Fady looking after us at check in. Beautifully appointed suite and a great location add to the hotels charm.  Breakfast on the first morning was chaotic and staff were unsure what was included and wasn’t in the ‘full’ breakfast package- to me full means everything! Second day was much calmer and staff proactively approached the menu!  The hotel was getting ready for the festival so we didn’t use the pool, but we knew that prior to booking. Plenty of activity in readiness for May but nothing intrusive. Felt a great time to visit with what we paid via BA holidays, all in all, highly recommended!"
2958,improve service. improve the friendliness of the employee with the guests.  improve employees' initiative in better serving guests. the staff are without direction.  the impression we had is that there is no training or charges from a manager.
2959,"The hotel is very well designed and clean. Only problem what we found is the service ... They are not the top quality members at all beside Denis , Hugo and Luis. 99% of the staff don't speak English at all. We had some problems with the spa part...hot tub was dirty, sauna was not warm../turn on to be warm by opened door?!/ and the gym ?! Not well filled... The restaurant is very expensive. Some dishes are on double prices or triples then in the city.  So next time even I liked the design of the hotel I will choose a different hotel which is more well prepared for visitors. "
2960,"Extremely old/outdated decor. There is a draft from all the windows, engineer said it's an old building and instructed to put towels around the windows to reduce the draft. Overpriced for a tiny cramped space. I didn't stay the second night, I ended up going to Swissotel for the same price. Their room  was 1000 times nicer, newer, cleaner, cozier, more spacious, and their service was awesome!!!"
2961,... worth a serious renovation and definitely below Sheraton standards...   Ridiculous breakfast choice...  And only 2 staff members to check in at peak time... what a shame...  Tiny loud room dating back from 60's...
2962,"what a disappointing experience! My husband and i really researched and took the time to pick out a great hotel for the many family members who were traveling here for our wedding.  We thought we had picked a great one! boy were we wrong!!!!!!!!!!!! We recently had over 20 wedding blocked rooms. The staff was beyond rude and unaccommodating  to several of my friends and family members.I too stayed here (the bride) the night before my wedding the gentleman behind the counter was so rude to me while i was checking in. I will never stay here again, and I most certainly would discourage any brides to ever book their wedding blocks here! So disappointing."
2963,the Hotel is for Interlargos conveniently located next to a large Shopping center. Rooms are comfortabel and clean. was lucky with check in fast and smooth but then the problems start: unable to connect to the internet with my ipad and even after 2 hours no solution (actually until check out). toilet in the first room didnt flush and had to switch rooms as at 19.00 of course no maintenance was available. wait for a taxi in the morning can be easily 20/30 min.
2964,"Look, this is a real nice hotel in a nice location at a reasonable price in Amsterdam.   Location is a quiet street just outside the inner canal ring, less than 2 miles from the central rail station south west. I took the train from the airport (wait for the intercity and splurge for 1st class ... a few extra Euro ... if you have luggage .. the Sprinter can get crowded) and then a Uber Black (again for the luggage) to the hotel for about10-15 Euros.  On the way back, I just grabbed an Uber Black direct to the airport but that ran to 75 Euro.  They offer the typical Dutch (""grandmother"") bikes for 17 Euro a day which is not outrageous for rental (other places with insurance are close) and the convenience of picking up and dropping off is hard to beat. Best way to get around town.…"
2965,"Love love love this hotel, we stayed here number of times during trips to paris and its just a great place.   we enjoy its location and amenties in the hotel. Will be back here for sure!  Recommend breakfast"
2966,Had visited the place with family from 14th to 16th June .One positive the place was extremely clean ..But that's it.......Not even once we felt comfortable but felt as if we are in someone's house and we must behave ourselves.Didn't enjoy at all. The owner gets cold as soon as u dissuade his travel agency'stours.
2967,"I visited Shang last night as we were on road and felt hungry. So we visited the hotel for grabbing something to eat. Mister chai was where we were taken to. The staff was really confused. We had ordered something, they brought a completely different order that too after waiting for 20 mins. When we confronted that this is not what we had ordered, it took them another 20 mins to bring our order (All this when we were the ONLY guests present at the place). When the order finally came, they told me the wrong thing to be vegetarian- I ate a bite of their chicken samosa and realised something wasn’t right. All they had to say was make a straight face and say sorry. They didn’t even begin to realise the gravity of this. The guy just brought us free shakes on the house which by the…"
2969,"We stayed here for 2 weeks in June.  It is half of a double hotel complex, the adjoining half being the Pestana Miramar.  Very good location, gardens, pools and breakfasts, but regretfully not very clean.  Most definitely not 4 star.  We complained about the lack of room cleanliness (9 items) and an attempt was made to improve it but not very successfully. Elesewhere the corridor carpets were badly stained, the stair handrails inside and out were grubby, some walls were in desperate need of repainting and the courtyard paving was loose and lifting in places, representing a trip hazard.  The final straw was being given a clean white towel with black oil staining.   We asked to speak to the General Manager but he was on annual leave.  We asked to speak to Mr Pestana who we…"
2970,"This hotel it’s extremely well located downtown Buenos Aires. Have a beatiful interior design. The hospitality it’s not their strong point. Common areas are in very bad shape,mainly closed or falling down. The bedrooms are going same way."
2971,"I've stayed twice, both times in a ""premium"" King room.  The beds are only ok.  Just flat sheets, not fitted.  The pillows are a mix - some newish, but flat.  Others very lumpy and old seeming.    This hotel is huge, and if you aren't part of one of the many conventions that go on there, you'll feel out of place in the common areas.  When convention sessions let out, the lines at the Starbucks and check-in desk are enormous.  I would guess about a 30+ minute wait for the check-in desk and 20 minutes for Starbucks.  The hotel is also showing its age, and did not seem very clean or organized to me.  The room number had fallen off the door of my friend's room, and they just replaced it with a handwritten sign - that stayed up for multiple days.  As another example, on checkout day…"
2972,"Vacation time, so let´s use the vouchers we earned at Vila Gale. It´s time to know better Oporto so let´s go. The hotel is OK with a huge lobby that for a while made me think that the hotel was renewed. Unfortunately the room we got was a little old and shabby. Large enough for 2 adults and 1 child but the furniture and all decoration needs to be replaced. The bed is not that confortable and only the pillows have a positive note. Bathroom is functional but also old. Breakfast is quite good and the restaurant area is nice. Also the bar is a nice place to chill and watch a football game. The hotel is walking distance from Rua de Santa Catarina (shopping and Majestic Cafe), Avenida dos Aliados, Torre dos Clérigos and the old Oporto neighbours. Oporto has a lot more to see but from…"
2973,"It is located in a quite surrounding but not far from Alexanderplatz, although it is a 3 tram stops away. Also bicycle can be rented from the hotel which is the best way for exploring the city centre. Rooms are quite good, clean and comfortable. Breakfast is excellent!!! What one can find missing is a swimming pool. Staff is very friendly, professional and polite. For my personal taste would prefer hotel a bit closer to Alexanderplatz and room with better view (my room did not have the street view but over some construction site)  but overall I enjoyed staying here."
2974,"The Mercure Hotel Berlin Mitte is a small hotel with lovely staff.  Because it is in a quiet street we initially thought we were isolated but soon found we were well placed to everything we wanted to see in Berlin. A two minute walk to the metro with lines that take you everywhere or a 10 min walk to Potsdamer Platz and the Brandenburg Gate.  Hitler's bunker is around the corner and a great Brewhouse, the BRLO is at the end of the street.  "
2975,"this is mind blowing  place to stay as per my point <3 , we are couple from  INDIA . and choose this Beautiful place PARIS City of love & fashion ,  Grate Hotel Great staff in Les Piaules  ..very helpful co operative  Love you all  Defiantly recommend for other trivalent friend"
2976,"The Maxime Hotel was a nice change of pace from the usual cookie cutter sterile hotel chain. I found the staff pleasant, courteous and very helpful with our navigation of the city and restaurant selection. Plenty of good restaurants nearby and it was a short walk to city center to hop aboard the train. The rooms are small but comfortable. Elevators are available, a little on the snug side. We discovered a larger elevator more convenient for bringing up luggage behind a door leading to the lobby. With the room I did wish for a little extra space for a dresser drawer but my wife and I managed. There is a room safe but I found it difficult to operate. The bathroom is tiny but well appointed. We visited during their off season - their entertainment program ended late June and…"
2978,Stayed here as was giving a talk in SF. Found staff in reception rude and minimal in assistance. Breakfast in the restaurant was a joke - the first time ever that I didn't tip. Room view was the bins and air-conditioning units - something I'd never expect at a boutique hotel!
2979,"This hotel had good reviews for a no-frills accommodation downtown. We are fine with mid-level hotels, and don't need frills and good views, especially for a reasonable price in an expensive location.   I had concerns once we got off the elevator. We were on the second floor, which is where the free breakfast is served. The entire hall reeked of stale bacon.   We booked a room with double beds to accommodate our three-person family for the night. Upon entering our room, which also reeked of stale bacon, we discovered that we were given a King room with a very tiny couch. I called the front desk, and the staff (rudely, I might add) stated that they could not move us to the room we had booked as this is all they had.   I requested some extra pillows and blankets be brought up so…"
2980,"A beautiful small  hotel in a great location , a Very warm welcome by the stuff  , the service was good as  Well. I had a classic room , it  was a really good size and clean. We highly recommend this place."
2981,"We stayed there for 2 nights while visiting Rio in February 2016. The hotel is very expensive for what you get (even through a booking website which is about 50% less than their advertised prices). However, I admit you pay for the location - it is right on Copacabana beach. However, I could literally hear every word the people in the room next to me were saying and I was not trying to listen (especially not at 7 am in the morning!). The linens were dirty, the reception staff not very helpful and the internet incredibly slow."
2982,"It actually takes more than giving complimentary toothbrushes to qualify as a 5 star hotel. This was the last stop on our 2 week tour of Spain and Portugal, and we booked all of the other hotels based on the Trip Advisor reviews. I am completely baffled as to how the Avenida Palace could have such high reviews, and how this place can call itself a 5 star.  We had requested a room on a high floor overlooking the square at the front to the building, and that is exactly what we received. The view was excellent and the double windows were very good at sheltering us from the street noise below. The room was a very ""goofy"" layout, which made organizing our bags very difficult. The bathroom was very cramped with very little space to put toiletry bags etc. The shower had pitiful water…"
2983,We stayed in a queen dorm bunk. Was surprisingly very comfortable! Plenty of showers on our floor & decent free breakfast. Would stay again. A little far from central station. About 40min walk. But there is a tram that can take you for about 2.50€. 
2984,Cold food that I waited over an hour for. Damp room with no aircon. Breakfast was ok but limited hot choices.  Shuttle bus ran whenever it wanted to in the end I used a taxi. Booked for 3 nights but only stayed 2. Dining area is very basic and overall ok to sleep one night only. Look elsewhere. 
2985,"The room reeked like cigarettes, the bathroom tub was completely clogged and staff wasn't accommodating at all!!! Not sure what happened because I have stayed here 3 times prior and it was always a lovely experience."
2987,"Stayed at this property for a night and it was a nightmare. Checked in late and got a room with a dirty bathroom, hair on a bed sheet, internet didn't work all night, breakfast was pricey and bad in taste. I would never come back to this property again."
2988,"Hotel shuttle driver didn't show up to meet us at port as promised.  Hotel gave us free shuttle to airport as compensation.  First room had mold and peeling paint on walls and ceilings.  Air conditioner was non functional.  Moved to better room.  Wi-Fi was down for two plus days.  Affected all guests.  Breakfast was good.  Delivered by friendly, hard working guy. With some serious maintenance this would be a great place."
2989,"Last August my husband and I stayed for a week at the 3 star superior Sylter Hof Hotel in the city centre of Berlin.. Our room on the 5th floor was reasonably large, immaculately clean and the air cond was in tiptop  condition, it faced a back garden and was very quiet. Buffet breakfast was very good and varied, most of the guests in this hotel were Germans and the staff spoke English very well and were very helpful. We had free internet at this hotel. Since we were on BB we ate daily a la carte at the Pucci Italian restaurant just next door to this hotel.  Prices were very reasonable, service was fast and the food was plentiful and something to brag about.  Right outside the hotel's main entrance there is a bus stop and the double decker bus No.100 goes practically to most of…"
2991,"Is our second turn on this Hotel and the excellent atmosphere, quality in all they do, the kindness and attitude hands on by the staff, plus been in a very well placed area close the Arc of Triumth and The Champs Elysee that is what we love. You will have all services very near, like Metro station, Supermarkets, Bakery, good restaurants. Excellent place to be in family or your love in a romantic travel. On this turn, we just had a little problem with the air conditioner system, as it was Central and without local command in the room, so it was warmer than we like, but manageable. "
2992,"Celebrating the Fourth of July here, BAD IDEA! No view of the fireworks! No pool! No access to apps like Netflix and Hulu on the TV! The $20 movie purchase of John Wick 3 expired way before it said it was supposed to. We do have a nice view of Navy Pier (again, no fireworks though) but the windows are dirty and spiders and their dinner are all over them, luckily on the outside. Look at the picture, the view is deceiving! Zoom in to see the spiders. Enough said! I’m so disappointed!"
2993,The restaurant Bistro has good food and a great service. The problem is the waiting time. We were almost alone outside in the restaurant (no one inside) and still we had to wait one hour and 20 minutes for the main course 
2995,"Wow - and I mean this in a sarcastic tone. This place sucked. My mom and I were disappointed and we kept cracking jokes about how shortcoming this place is from a 5 stars experience. Let me just say that I have been to many 5 stars resort and while yes, the resort is stunningly beautiful, it's because it's brand new.... And so are the employees.  Logistics from pickup was awkward and left a bad first impression until the very end.  The driver who picked us up at the airport kept asking me if I was the person being picked up, I said yes like three times to confirm. The driver then left me and my mom to sit alone in the van waiting for 25 minutes because he went to go and look for two ""white people""... He assumed that I wasn't who I said I was because I have an American name and I…"
2996,"Absolutely horrible, sinks with cracks. Carpets grubby. I had 4 rooms booked until the 2nd of January checked out today, the lady at reception didn’t ask why was there anything she could do. No refund offered. "
2998,"My wife and I recently took a trip to Shanghai. We decided to stay here because we had in the past. To be specific, our previous stay here was over four years ago. Back then, it was nice and relatively new.   My how things have changed. The rooms and other facilities are not cleaned or kept up well.  The first thing we noticed was a mildew smell, and we saw mold in a few places. Next, we encountered a ball of hair on the shower floor. The grossest thing was the stained sheet, that looked like someone had sat down on it without clothes. There were various other stains as well. We contacted the front desk, and they sent someone to change the bedding. The housekeeper said that it was probably bleach stains. Not likely...   The free breakfast had many choices. The Chinese options…"
2999,"Have just recently returned from Vilabranca and we were expecting a lot better according to TA reviews.  Rooms are ok, good size with adequate kitchen equipment.  Pool had not been cleaned when we first arrived and was only cleaned three days into our stay.  No sunbeds or umbrella around the pool either.  Vilabranca advertise that they have a shuttle bus to the beach, not when we were there and you do need it.  Walk to beach is fine about 20 mins at a good pace.  But coming back is all uphill, not suitable for the older tourist or young child and the same distance to the main shopping area, downhill going but coming back is tough.  Why say they have a shuttle service and then not provide it.  We did ask at reception and were told it was too early in the season. Bar was not open…"
3000,"The hotel is reasonable, its up in the hills so cooler than in town, the staff were helpful enough and the room was clean and well kept. These are the plus points.  Now the bad, you wont sleep a wink here the noise from doors being banged all night with such force you'd think they are trying to put them through the wall and is unbearable and relentless, there is no kettle or any facilities at all in the room for a drink or some food, no fridge so you have to buy everything from the hotel and its not cheap, they are even reluctant to give you two tea bags instead of one which makes the tea too weak.  They need to seriously fix the door problem ( although this is down to ""people"") maybe some sort of door soft closer.  The next big drawback is there is NO wifi in the rooms, this is…"
3001,"The hotel itself is fine per the standard of an international Sheraton although slightly dated. The staff though went out of their way not to be particularly helpful. The experience felt as if any request or inquiry was a bother. The location is decent, not exactly central but not very far from the action. "
3002,"I should give one star but since the FD guy was so nice I will give 2 stars.  This is by far, the worst experience we've had at a Marriott. We are Marriott Vacation Club owners and I wouldn't come back here, ever, although I probably would have to come back if I wanted to go to Tahoe again (unless Timberlodge is available, I'd much prefer to go there).  Anyway, why a bad review? We checked in as a family of 4 adults and 3 children and we had two rooms reserved. Obviously we wanted to be together because anyone who has 3 kids (2 year old twins mind you and a 4 year old) understands that they need their own room and they are quite difficult so the person taking care of them definitely needs some help doing so. Anyway, we check in and the guy informs us that the reservations people…"
3003,"On arrival you’d be fooled in thinking this was more of an apartment block than a hotel. Finding the reception is a little tricky having to walk through an atrium to get to it but the staff were very friendly on arrival. The room was very spacious and very clean, I was in a suite on the top floor and the kitchen and bathroom were great as was the little balcony. The hotel itself was dead quiet and I barely saw any other guests. I say guests but I think some people stay here for months on end. Don’t bother with the breakfast because it’s poor; unless you like cheese and cold meats in the morning. I was offered a boiled egg. Literally that was it, an egg on a plate in its shell.   The hotel is fantastically located 5 mins walk from Checkpoint Charlie and about 20 mins from…"
3004,"Excellent stay at the JW Marriott. Great service. Perfect location. It is a small hotel but recently upgraded so all in very good condition. Recommend the suites with view of the ocean, you have a balcony and can have breakfast watching the yachts."
3005,5 star hotel and everything is outstanding. It was luxury hotel and in center of everything.   I Would recommend the hotel . It is equipped with coffee and tea maker as well as water.  The reception area is congested and in a small area. 
3006,"I enjoyed my stay their, from the reception to the room and the overall service! I liked the food as well. The hotel has all you may need. Definitely recommended! I also love the neighborhood and I am sure I will return!"
3008,"If you have business in the centre of Paris, this is a wonderful location, especially if you like to take a stroll along wonderful Paris-city streets - only a 20 minute walk in either direction to Gare du Nord or Centre Pompidou. There was restaurant noise in the square until about midnight on the weekend, but I quite enjoy the feeling of being in the middle of everything and it was quiet in the morning for a good sleep-in, given there is no through traffic. We didn't have the set breakfast but just ordered coffee and some eggs separately, very well made. There are tons of places to eat around the corner on Rue Saint-Denis. The room was comfortable, with a good deep bath to relax."
3009,"Amazing hotel located in Mitte around the corner from the Hausvogteiplatz U-Bahn station. This was ideal to get to Alexanderplatz where my friend was staying and to use as a base to see the things I wanted to see and run the Berlin Half.   Really warm and friendly welcome, a great room which was very large with a great bathroom and facilities. It had the biggest headboard I have ever seen.   Very helpful front of house and all staff were very nice. Breakfast was amazing with a massive choice and gluten-free options available. I love German bacon, it’s the best especially with the amazing eggs.   The bacon is always a highlight but so was the location of the hotel. Walk left out of the hotel and you’re suddenly in Gendarmenmarkt Square. Walk right and you’re walking towards The…"
3010,"We stayed 3 nights at Emm Hue and we felt a bit disappointed after 3 days. We have stayed at Emm Saigon and Emm Hue is not as good as the one in SG. We stayed in a connecting room and here are the minus points of it: - First night we could not sleep at all because the 2 air conditioners are not properly working at all, even at 18 degree with maximum of fan. They could have checked it before check in. The next day we complained to the FO and it was fixed to normal. And thanks for the quick response to it. - family of 4 and with connecting room they should have 2 toilets. We have stayed in Ha Noi, Mui Ne and Hoi An and all our connecting rooms we got have 2 toilets for 2 different rooms. I meant 4 of us using 1 toilet, u can't hold it when u have needs. And  we are 4 but everyday…"
3011,"Perfect for our break at a reasonable price, nothing fantastic but rooms were clean and had all we needed. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Breakfast was good, although the place did lack a bar to relax in following a hard days sightseeing. It is reasonably close to a metro station, which you need to use, as it’s a long walk to most of the sights. I would recommend the hotel although it is very basic "
3012,"Accomodation is Berlin is not cheap compared to Southern European cities. But this hostel does its best to give you excellent value for money! Extremely clean, spacious rooms, helpful staff, clean bathroom, bike rental at 10 eur, excellent gin and tonic at 6,5 eur, ample breakfast buffet, towels included, sheet included, and a great location right beside a metro station to take you anywhere and at 300m of many cool restaurants. This is one of the best hostels I have ever stayed in! One point of critique, the wifi never worked, if they solve that one, they are one perfect hostel in Berlin!"
3013,"We just loved this neighborhood! Great little street with so many little grocery shops and restaurants! Hotel gave us what we needed clean place to sleep, great a/c, good breakfast (not included in room price). Staff is really perfect, friendly and helpful! Eiffel Tower is only 10 minutes walk! "
3014,"The hotel is located a short walk from Alexander Platz station which is dead handy for access across most of the city. The staff are very friendly and helpful, even going out of there way to look up attrations and places they had not heard off. The breakfast is not bad for an inclusive price."
3015,"Absolutely love the resort but I can't believe how my father-in law has been treated. As an owner he is on the 4th floor over looking the parking structure. Come on guys, he owns an ocean view and you put him in this crappy room. This is a joke. I guess owning a week gets you absolutely nothing. "
3016,"The retrofit of the old hotel has been very well done, keeping the original architecture of the building while introducing all modern amenities. But when it comes to service, my reason to choose sheraton brand instead of other options in the city, the hotel has a long way to go. On the first afternoon the AC from my room stop working. They just came to fix it after 2 calls and 2 visits to the front desk. on the morning of the coming day, it stop again. After calling again, they send some one, that just look at the display, and said: You need a new room, After some calls the front desk promised to call me back in 2 minutes. She did not. I had to go down again to fix it. Finnaly the informed I could move only on the afternoon, because there was no avaiable room at that time. When…"
3017,"Properties are very beautiful but service level wasn't where it needed to be. Very little flexibility, food wasn't nice, took ages to get food. EUR 24/H for nanny services and they send someone from front desk who smelled like they'd been drinking. "
3018,Just back form a lovely weekend in Berlin with Hotel Berlin Mitte the base for our group of 7 couples.  We arrived late on Thursday and were booked in quickly.  The rooms are clean and have good size bathrooms.  The breakfeast selection is the best I have seen for sometime.  All of the staff were freindly and were happy to help with any question or problem any of our group had.  Close to everything but still quite.  I would highly recommend this hotel and hopr to return some time soon.
3019,"Nice hotel in a very nice district with S and U bahn stations in view of hotel entrance. We very much enjoyed our stay here and in Berlin as a whole. It was cold whilst we were there and the heating was on low in the hotel. Although this was needed no doubt, our room, although very large with a high ceiling got a bit stuffy at night so we left the windows open to get some fresh air. Problem was that in the morning, people walking past going to work, deliveries, Dustbin lorries etc were operating outside and this woke us up. We overcome this by leaving the windows open in our room until we actually got into bed when we then closed them. This worked and we slept well for the rest of our stay. However, i can see that this might be a problem when the summer temperatures come as…"
3020,Hotel Mathios is a nice family run place - very clean and nice rooms. In general the whole area is kept very clean and nice. We enjoyed the silence by the pool. The food menu which you are offered at the hotel is not good very good - nor is the breakfast setup. In the Akritori area there are not much to do (which was completely OK for us) - nor the restaurants are very good - except for one - try the fish restaurant Remezzo very close to Mathios - just down the hill on the other side of the road. Amazing fresh fish served with love. A special thanks to Minna + Kostas for making it a pleasant stay - thanks!
3021,"I superb located boutique hotel in the shopping district Kudamm. Edgy and with style, high standards and a chic atmosphere. It is expensive and not always value for money, but anyhow a good choice staying in Charlottenburg.  "
3022,"My fiancé and I stayed here for 1 night on the way back from south of France before flying home from Paris.   This hotel was very cute and friendly. They have a kitchen area with free water and coffee as well as beers, wine, food, etc that you can buy by putting your name down on paper and saying what you took (then added to your final price).  Though the room we had was small, it was perfect. Very cozy and warm. Adorable little lights and decor. The shower was really cool as well with little lights in it.   Good hair and shower products provided, hair dryer provided but didn’t use it - looked nice!   Bed was very, very comfortable.   I have a thing for finding cute, affordable hotels when we travel and this was by far my fiancé’s favorite.   Thank you for the great stay!! We will be back very soon!   …"
3023,I joined the 2018 Berlin Marathon and had some change of itinerary so I had to stay one more night in Berlin. Found this hotel and chose it because of a TripAdvisor review written by an architect about how lovely the interiors are. And yes she was correct. The interior design details have been thought about individually. Next time I fly to Berlin I will definitely stay again at this hotel!
3024,"hmm, Where do I start, the carpets look like they haven't been replaced since the 40's or washed. The doors appear to have 5inches of paint on them. Over all appearance is god awful, the smell awful, the ego waffles for breakfast, awful. This hotel has THE feel of a hostel with private rooms. Oh and did i mention there is NO A/C! You are better of just spending the extra 100.00 and staying some place decent. TRUST ME, this place is the SUCK."
3025,Reasonable hotel. Nice view over the city from the higher level rooms. good and friendly service in restaurant and bar. Overall a bit high prices hotel. Do not park at the hotel. You will pay approx. €100 per day! Ridiculos. Closeby is another parking €10 per day.
3026,"The hotel is quite charming with more of a boutique decor.  French Windows that open to the street.  Completely updated and modernized.  And reasonably priced for the area.  The rooms are quite cozy (small by American Standards), but very parisian and comfortable.  Great stay.  Wonderful staff and great location close to 3 different metro stations. Plenty of Bistros and Cafes to eat or grab a drink in the area.  Staff was very friendly, cheerful and accomodating.   Note that they do not have key cards for the rooms. You will need to return your key when you leave.  But the reception is open 24 hours, so no trouble accessing the key.  Actually quite a charming old world touch."
3027,"The Verlaine which opened late 2018 is a lovely centrally positioned yet quiet small hotel in its own nice grounds, occupying a century old building which has been beautifully refurbished to the highest standard. The young staff are extremely attentive, helpful and professional."
3028,"I stayed three nights in this hotel in Oct 2012. The place definitely needs a renovation. There were stains on the carpet, worn out wooden door frames, cracked tiles in the shower... and the tv channel selection sucks. The room had been designed nicely but poorly maintained. The floor of the shower box didn't have proper tilt to allow the water flow to the drain so water would stand on the flower which is border line safety/health issue. There was some work done on the floor which was completed by uneven white color grout messing up the original tiles, sign of the fact that the standard of work acceptance at the hotel is very low.  There are two hotels on this property and by looks of the lobby, the Sheraton (not the Four Points Sheraton) is the newer of the two. The lobby of…"
3029,Apt - 2 bedrooms 2 bath w/pullout - perfect for 6.  Modern and super clean! Balcony to see the locals and tourists.  Front desk staff was very helpful!  Wifi - excellent speed.  Pastries/OJ/Milk to take back to your apt for breakfast - every day.  The stay included a tourist bus ticket for 6 which we felt was the best way to see the city sights and get your bearings. Subway is right across the street - Blue L5.  We got 10 ride subway/bus ticket and we were able to get to Parc Guell in 15 minutes.  Subway to Placa Catalunya / El Born / Gothic area is also less than 20 minutes - with one subway transfer. Hospital San Pau is an ahhhmazing architectural gem which is one block away from the hotel.  Perfect for grabbing a pastry/coffee in the morning and taking in the view.  Also…
3030,"The hotel is situated in a good location, close to bust stops in the hotel area of Funchal . Staff were very helpful and friendly, although there appeared to be too few on duty during dinner. The hotel is tired and needs renovation. Concrete around the hotel is badly worn and cracked and some balconies did not look safe. The pool was clean but the pool edges were cracked and painful on bare feet.. Tiles were missing from the pool shower and the pipes loose. Sun beds were old and uncomfortable."
3031,"I did not book the cheapest room there, but I felt it was misleading.  The ""balcony"" was about 2 1/2 feet by 4 1/2 feet.  Balcony? No, that's an oversized ledge.  The bathroom was newer, so that was good. The free breakfast was ... free.  The desk staff were polite, but unhelpful with 3 requests I made (rent a bicycle, change non-US currency, find some flu medicine).  They didn't change the bedding, and when I asked for a wake-up call they woke me up at 11:00 pm by knocking at the door to confirm that I wanted a wake-up call the next morning.  They never made the wake-up call!"
3032,"This is certainly one of the best and mots luxurious hotels in Germany. We enjoyed a junior suite with a large bathrooms, comfortable living room and all the works... we loved to swim in the pool with spa, we enjoyed the bar with piano player ... and then the next morning ... what a breakfast surprise - never experienced such a giant variety of food from all over the world just for a breakfast!!!"
3033,"My family and i, were stay here for 3 nights. The hotel was under construction, so the lobbey was not clean. Our room was on 8th floor, near to the air conditioner, so was very noisy. The bathroom is very slidery, especialy after taking bath, or even using the toilet, but it was very big. I advise guests to don't stay in room number 808! It is not comfortable at all! Breakfast is moderate. Elevators are very slow, sometimes we had to wait gor more than 5 minutes for it. Internet is very slow. The pool was closed!!!! Is this hotel really a 5 star hotel?"
3034,"I see from Tripadvisor that this hotel has many complimentary reviews and a few not-so-complimentary reviews.  Unfortunately, I must relay uncomplimentary events that took place during my stay at the JW Marriott in Rio de Janeiro.     The hotel is located across the street from the beach in Copacabana.  The hotel is attractive and most employees appear attentive to the needs and requests of guests.   The hotel has a nice executive lounge.  I did not use the gym facilities or the pool.  Following my all-night flight from the U.S. to Rio, I wanted a short rest and to clean up for a meeting that I had planned for that evening.  While using the shower, the water would not drain.  As the water ran from the shower head, water accumulated in the floor of the tub.  Needless to say,…"
3035,"I was pretty disappointed in this hotel. I needed an ""inexpensive"" place to stay one night and looking online, thought this one may fit the bill. The pictures looked nice on their website, but the images you see are far from the truth.  It was not inexpensive, after the taxes and resort fees, even with my AAA ""discount"" it came to over $150 per night. I paid extra for an ocean view room (what the hell, you only live once) and the room I got was a partial ocean view at best.  I see some complaints about the reception, however both girls I dealt with were very friendly and nice.  The bed made horrible squeaking noises every time I moved. I feel sorry for whoever was in the room beneath me. It was also horribly warped and not at all comfortable.  I had to call the front desk to…"
3036,"We have just left the A La Carte Da Nang after a 3 night visit and I so wanted to be able to give it a good review but unfortunately it just did not live up to expectations. Now maybe the problem was my expectations but I am not the type of person who complains because the sun set was at the wrong time or the lemon in my gin and tonic was too lemony, so here are some thoughts to manage your expectations if thinking of booking at this hotel.  Do not expect a good nights sleep. The walls are so thin and the doors and cheap and not sound proofed and even though we were at the end of the corridor we could hear every ding of the lift, every footstep on the corridor, every conversation and every door closing.  Do not expect to enjoy the rooftop pool or lounge area. This is a stunning…"
3037,"This is possibly one of the most uncomfortable hotels of this class I've ever stayed in.    The lighting system is overly complicated.  It was impossible to just turn a light off or on.  There was a whole panel one had to use.  I could never turn off the light in the closet. It's ironic since the hotel prides itself on being ""green.""  The sliding glass door between the bathroom and the closet was awkward and inconvenient.  There was no luggage rack. I had to put my suitcase on the desk which meant I couldn't use the desk or the desk chair and I had to maneuver to use the coffee machine.  The spa is very minimal--two lounge chairs near the lukewarm ""hot tub.""    Housekeeping was poor.  One day I received no towels.  Toiletries were inconsistent.  On my first evening, when I asked…"
3038,"We were in Berlin to visit friends and this hotel was recommended to us as it was in the right part of town.  In fact, it was something like 10 minutes from our friends.  We had booked one of the larger double rooms and mentioned we were not in our first Y youth.  We got one of the larger rooms, on the 5th floor - but the lift only goes to the 4th so it was a bit of a schlepp - first of all with the suitcases, and then every time. Berlin houses have the peculiarity of one lift on one side of the building and then a walk all the way to the other side.  So we would recommend booking rooms 501-2-3 as they are at least on the lift side!  Otherwise it was fine - nice large room, big bathroom, even a small terrace.  All very clean.  Breakfast was a bit average but plenty of it.  Staff…"
3039,"This review is for the lobby bar.  I live in SF and have been to the lobby bar twice in the last month.  The first time I had a mediocre burger & soggy fries.  I figured it was an off night.   I was there again on Christmas Eve.  I had an awful flatbread pizza & fake lobster roll sandwich .  To top it they tried to pass off well vodka for Ketel One.  I’d expect this at a Marrriott...but at the Four Seasons??  On a positive note, they did have very good service....awful food but good attentive staff."
3040,"I was lucky enough to have a room with...Private swimming pool on the rooftops of Paris. Yes you read well, my small swimming pool in front of my room on the roofs:-) heated as it should be. The atmosphere, the magnificent decoration, the young, friendly, warm staff, make this hotel one of the best hotels in Paris, in its category. (Thank you Rosella for your welcome:-)"
3041,"The room was clean and serviced daily - though often late - and adequate. Enough storage though only one coat hanger. There appeared to be only one lift working in the building which, given the number of floors and the fact that breakfast is in the basement meant long waits every morning. Breakfast was poor. Tea and coffee served from two machines, one of which wasn’t working, and not particularly great in any case. Fruit juices had a funny taste (perhaps they were powdered?) and the fruit salad seemed to be tinned. Cheese and meats weren’t replenished often enough and the tables weren’t cleared: overall the impression was that there weren’t enough staff to keep the dining room running. On our final morning there was a party of 50+ men presumably there for a conference and we…"
3042,"The hotel itself is nice and cozy. The problem is that staff at the front desk are not very truthful. I was with wedding party that booked rooms months in advance and was told there would be a discount given to the party of the wedding of about 15%. The day after the wedding during checkout, the person at the front desk whose name is LILIA said you are at the regular rate of $235.00 and i said ""No, I am with the wedding party and there is a discount that would be applied because if the wedding. She said ""No there is no discount"" and proceeded to finalize the bill. I then ask is there a manager or anyone else that can fix this, it took her about 2 min. of me arguing with her for her to say she can look more into the details, and she finally said, oh yeah you're right there is a…"
3043,"Exceptional neighborhood location which is close to so many Parisian experiences (cafes, bakeries, produce, and history). Exceptional staff with multi language capabilities. Very comfortable room. Feels like home."
3044,"This hotel has a great location, and that is probably the only reason why it is worth staying there. The staff is below service minded and the rooms are not in good shape. When asking the staff for help we got the respond ""I'll see what I can do"" with a bad attitude and no follow up. "
3045,I stayed for 2 nights at Vila Gale Porto in July 2016. The hotel is large and caters to tour buses. The common areas are starting to show the high volume of people such as elevator buttons missing and chipped furniture. The rooms are fine for the category. The location is a bit on the north of town but the subway is close by and it is the direct line to the airport. The pool area is good after a day of sightseeing and the hotel food was above average.
3046,"We ate here for a corporate event whilst in Berlin.  From the moment we arrived the service was excellent .  As there were so many of us we had to have one choice from the three course menu.  The prawns were excellent succulent and fresh in rice and sauce very good.  Main course of duck with potatoes and red cabbage was excellent in a sauce .  Dessert was excellent apple tart and cream very good.  Excellent choice of red and white wine service was off highest standard all evening , would nightly recommend eating here .    "
3047,"My recent stay was less than adequate.  It may look like a Ritz Carlton but the service and professionalism is not.  I was in residence here where the hotel first opened 8 years ago.   I gave them a break as it was a new hotel. 8 years later they have not worked it out.  Toilets don’t flush properly, showers are ill designed and the managers argue with you if you raise a concern.  Opt for the Park Hyatt or the Grand Hyatt."
3048,I've stayed at Arvor Saint Georges twice so far and will likely come back again. I really like the area it is located in and appreciate the fact that it is a small hotel with a friendly and private feel - almost a bit like staying at a private house. 
3049,"If like us you like to have a tube station nearby then book your stay at the Crowne Plaza. The tube is 2mn from the hotel. The hotel is lovely. From our arrival until the check out the service was very good. The room was spacious, ours was on the fifth floor. The bed was comfortable and the room was well presented.More storage would have been nice as we stayed for 5 days but I might have packed more than needed to :-) The bathroom was spacious. There was a bath and a walking shower. The reasons I am not giving it a 5* it’s because in my opinion there was a lack of attention to details. Nothing that would prevent me to go back but when we arrived in our room there were only towels for 1 person, 2 bathrobe and one pair of slippers. The kettle was leaking and the TV only worked the…"
3050,"We stayed here for two nights. We are familiar with Lagos and enjoyed the close proximity to the beach.  Check in was efficient and informative, we did however after a  couple of hours due to excessively noisy air conditioning.  We found the hotel bar staff very off hand on the first night, but when they were quieter on the second night, couldn't be more helpful. Although we had a lovely stay not sure we would return if staying in Lagos again but this is purely a personal choice."
3051,"Everyone was very helpful and a great experience in this apartment. Our biggest issue was availability of rooms. We stayed there on a return visit to Berlin, not being available the first time. Some renovations being completed in the courtyard, but it was almost complete when we left and didn’t impact us except providing something for our 3 year old to watch."
3052,"We combined my business trip with a couples trip.  Expecting a typical tiny Paris hotel room with a double bed and little or no air conditioning, we were delighted with two twin beds combined to make a king and great air conditioning!    The staff is professional, courteous and very helpful and there is someone on the desk at all hours.  The room and bathroom were lovely, peaceful, and comfortable.  In the room we especially liked the little nooks in the walls that served as night stands (they have flowers in the website photos.) Two narrow closets have an area for hanging garments and shelves for stacking which was sufficient for two. Lights can be controlled from the bed.  The safe was large enough to hold everything we needed to store there.   The bathroom has a deep tub.  We…"
3053,"After a cruise, my family spent two nights in this wonderful hotel. We booked two Junior Suites for my children and grandchildren, and one DELUXE EXECUTIVE VIEW ROOM for my wife and I. We all loved the friendly and efficient staff and my kids were awed by their suites. The included breakfast was the best such buffet that I have ever experienced in Europe. This is a great place to stay. BUT, my otherwise lovely room had no shower. To be precise no separate shower. My $563.00 room had a hand shower in a tub. I asked for a room with a shower and we were switched to a small room with one tiny window. I was told that there would be a commensurate adjustment in the rate. The total bill for the three rooms was $4,601.56 for the two nights. The adjustment for the awful room (with a nice…"
3054,Stayed at the Hotel Phileas for 2 nights. Great location. Extremely pleasant staff who could not have done any more for us. The rooms were very clean and well appointed. The bathrooms were very big and well appointed. Would recommend very highly.
3055,"Arrived late morning and told to come back later to check in which was perfectly acceptable. Returned late afternoon and check-in an absolute joke. Painfully slow with one girl unable to check us in, so why leave her on the front desk. Room clean and nicely decorated, but sleep after 6.00 in morning because of the extractor fan duct from the kitchen directly adjacent to the bedroom window. Very poor, certainly not worth the money, would not suggest this hotel"
3056,"My brother and I were spending the weekend on vacation. We only wanted a reasonable and clean room. What we got was terrible service and a misserable experiance. DO NOT stay here. I'd give 0 stars if i could. Advertises a non-existant free breakfast and gave me more obviously soiled sheets to replace the bloody ones we found on the bed. Choice hotels is close to losing our business forever if they let other motels be like this. I dont require much, just that my hotel be clean. That is all."
3057,"InterContinental Hotel Chicago Review  I am an IHG Platinum Ambassador and at every IHG Property where I stay I get sensational VIP Service... EXCEPT HERE!  The InterContinental Hotel on the Magnificent Mile of Chicago is anything but “magnificent” and I will NEVER stay here again!  I highly recommend that YOU NOT STAY HERE either!  Check in went well. They welcomed me and assigned me to a nice room. NOT an Upgraded Suite, as often I get at IHG, but definitely a nice corner room.  The bed was comfortable although the HVAC was not very good and the windows had shades that were very annoying to use. But all of that was fine.  There was a problem with the plumbing and in the middle of the night, we had a flood in our bathroom. It is unclear what caused it, but I called the Front…"
3058,We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment. The apartment was great with plenty of space good quality fittings and a large terrace. In other circumstances this would get a four or five star rating. However view from the balcony and all main rooms maybe to the sea but in between are  the main dual carriageway/motorway and 2 other roads. Not surprisingly therefore there was a lot of road noise both during the day and into the night. Also there are no restaurants or bars within walking distance even though Funchal is only a short drive away. The pool on site is good but it is a very steep walk to get there. Also the golf club bar and restaurant are good (if a little prices) but again a very step walk (of 20 minutes all uphill) to get there. We would go back to Madeira but not here.
3059,"When reviews mention stairs, believe them. We ended up in a room on the top floor and had three flights of many, many, steep stairs.  And breakfast in the morning is down an additional flight of stairs.  I went out once in morning and came back in evening as it was just too much. My partner is in excellent shape and even said it was a bit ridiculous.  Keep this in mind if you make reservations.  Also, you will be sharing breakfast room in lower level with Canal Resident Hotel beside this hotel.  Breakfast buffet was just average and cramped in seating. The street is under construction, major construction and actually shut down. Noise was not a problem, however.  This was our second stay in Amsterdam and quite a disappointment staying here."
3060,"I travelled for the weekend in Paris for the Roland Garros. The hotel is perfectly placed, excellent overall. Totally recommend it. Nice staff, very helpful, quiet area, good location. We ate a wonderful breakfast. "
3061,"Went with my partner over NYE 18/19, both of us really liked this hotel. The staff are super friendly, the continental breakfast was really good and the room was really modern and clean/fresh. We had a room against the street on the 6th floor and you can barely hear the traffic outside so there was no problem sleeping.Across the street and around the hotel you'll find 24h shops, kebabs, restaurants, bars/pubs and some shopping. The hotel is just at short Über drive from all landmarks, more nice restaurant and big shopping streets.Both me and my partner would recommend Hotel MANI, it's well worth the money!//Erik & Vera (SWE)"
3062,Not a cheap hotel but really think was worth the £200 a night.  Fabulous location right in the heart of gothic quarter.  Staff were great - really helpful in booking taxis and providing us directions etc.  Roof top pool is really lovely. Only negative for me is the fact that it is salt water not fresh water but that's a really small thing comparatively.  Nice touch is that in pm they have free food area with salad and sandwiches/quiche etc available to nibble on by the pool area.  Hotel extras like drinks really were reasonable value - didn't feel like that normal hotel uplift you get. Even the breakfast at 20 a head wasn't too bad as there is a great selection and you can even help your self to a Bloody Mary to start your day.   Rooms were good. Only thing for me that would…
3063,"I recently stayed at the Clift and are sorry to say the experience was less than enjoyable based on security concerns. The hotel itself is nice enough, the rooms are spacious and the restaurant and bar on the ground level are pleasant places to be. Regrettably, perhaps due to the location, customers are not safe whilst standing on the pavement out front of the hotels entrance and the hotel offers zero security for its guests."
3064,"I would NOT advise anyone to stay at this motel. Apparently Priceline does not check out the motels they recommend. I booked a room with 2 Queen size beds for 2 adults. We checked in  Monday Dec 15, 2014 - checking out Wednesday Dec 17, 2014, approximately 3:30 pm. When we checked in the clerk did not ask us for any information except to take my CC & the cash I paid. I signed no paperwork except for the CC receipts. The clerk did not speak hardly any English. Tuesday morning we left early & didn't get back until late. We were there for my son to have cancer surgery at UCSF Tuesday morning. Priceline said the motel was 2.46 miles from UCSF, this is not true it is actually 3.1 miles to UCSF from the motel. The beds were so hard, it was like sleeping on a board, we both had such a…"
3065,"Hotel location was excellent and central to everything, front desk and bell staff great, lobby was filled with an excellent aroma, king deluxe room met expectations, but housekeeping staff entered my room when there was a do not enter sign on the door. I returned from dinner to find housekeeping had setup a rollaway bed I did not order in the room. Upon contacting the front desk it was removed quickly but it makes we question the security and hotel procedures if housekeeping will enter the room when there is a do not disturb sign on the door. Explained as, ""sorry bed was for another room"". Luckily, I didn't have anything unsecured in the room but I expect better from a ""Sofitel"" hotel hence the 3 stars only."
3066,"So disappointed in this hotel. SF is known for boutique hotels, however Hotel Vitale needs a facelift desperately! The rooms are dull & lackluster. Online they were described as being tranquil in blue. My room was spacious by SF standards, but lacked anything special. Luckily my view made up for the ambience of the room. It's my understanding they will be updating the hotel in a year, and I will not be back until it's brought into the 21st century. The staff was very professional & friendly, the restaurant was outstanding!"
3067,"Great location. Near main tourist attractions and easily accessible by underground or walking. Surrounded by good restaurants and shopping. Breakfast buffet in hotel is wonderful. My wife and I had junior suite. It's roomy and has walk--in shower we requested. The odd thing about the room is that apparently because of the shower the room seems to be capable of being transformed into a handicapped room. For our stay the room was a hybrid having some elements of handicapped room(such as emergency pull chords) but lacking others (grab bars for toilet were recessed into wall). Overall, this gave the room an odd ambiance. Similarly odd and jarring was modern industrial decor of hotel which, from the outside, would seem better suited to a classical design. This gives hotel a cold, aloof feeling.  Aesthetics aside, for location, breakfast and room size the hotel is an excellent choice.…"
3068,"I am writing this review from the Intercontinental Shanghai Expo. I am in the standard room. I am very happy with it. It is well appointed, fresh and well sized. I am satisfied with this hotel and will give it a good review. In contrast, when I arrived at the JW Marriott for a 5 night stay celebrating an anniversary, they tried to fit me in a stuffy closet of a room. I am a Marriott gold member (earned by 50+ nights annually) and until now was never given a room smaller than a suite in Asia by the Marriott group.  For this stay I called the hotel to request a romantic setup for the anniversary and I was promised a suite. When I arrived, there was no suite, just the standard sized room and no romantic setup.  I told the staff that the room is no good and the let me walk. (12AM!!)…"
3069,Spent 6 nights there.  The furniture in the room was old and not in good shape.  The couch had little support left and very uncomfortable.  Beds were not firm at all.  Had problems getting hot water out the sink in bathroom.
3070,"We spent four nights at the San Regis and thought it was generally pretty great. The location can’t be beat, just a block or so away from the Champs Elysées and close to several metro stations. The room was nice and large, and air conditioned, which was a must for a Parisian summer. The staff was helpful and friendly. The breakfast was very good, though a bit expensive. We didn’t eat any other meals at the hotel. The airline lost two of our bags in transfer and the hotel dropped them in our room as soon as they arrived. One note that seems to be a Paris thing, if the hotel calls a cab for you, they charge an additional 7 euro on top of the fare. So we only did that once because it doubled our fare. On the whole, I would recommend this hotel and would stay here again. "
3071,"This establishment is in a privileged location, just off Highway 1, and overlooking the Pacific Ocean. When you arrive by car, it looks like your average roadside motel. We were assigned the last room, in the last cottage, farthest from the front desk. While the room was listed as ""Oceanview"" you could only view a small sliver of ocean, beyond another row of cabins that stood between our room and the ocean. As we walked in, a strong smell of smoke hit us, presumably from recent or frequent use of the fireplace and poor ventilation. The room looks out to a grassy area on one side, the parking area on another, and the garbage bin on the back. There was no closet to speak of, just a bar to hang your clothes from. A basic bathroom with no amenities completed the picture. The…"
3072,Left some clothes and fitness equipment in the room when checking out but only realised the next day upon arriving home and unpacking.  Emailed hotel immediately but got a reply that housekeeping did not find anything in the room.  Housekeeping personnel either didn't check or they did and kept the items. Won't be going back and wouldn't recommend this hotel based on this experience.
3073,Nice rooms with good beds. Staff friendly and helpful. Breakfast had everything you could wish for and of good quality. I stayed there with my teenage granddaughter and she was happy because it is close to shopping. Central. 
3074,"Won't be staying here again... Bathroom was dirty (black hairs in the tub), tub barely drained, bed was uncomfortable, and my neighbors sounded like they were in my room because there was so little sound-proofing. "
3075,"Everything in the rooms is so old and looks dirty. You won't like to touch anything. I used to clean everything with antibacterial wipes first everyday after the housekeeping. We all had Bed-Bug-Bites. And made a video of bed bugs as well. Rugs are super dirty. Drainage problems, so we had to change the room. Some of the staff don't have the manners, they are rude, whereas some are really good and soft spoken. Won't like to spend on all these problems and the old furnishings ever again. After staying at Radisson we stayed at a different hotel which was super clean and nothing was ages old there. It was well kept. Would never come back to Radisson. No."
3076,"We were very excited for our mini getaway. The hotel is very cute with clean and comfortable rooms. Upon check in, we were quite pleased with our choice. That ended when we realized that this must be a party hotel. At midnight I was awakened by almost nightclub volume level music. This went on until 3 a.m. It then started again at 6 a.m. and continued until we gave up on our hope of sleeping in on a day we took off from work and left. When booking here, do check it they've booked a party room on the floor you'll be on. In fact, I am shocked the whole building couldn't hear the nightclub party room next to us."
3078,"Visited China for the first time, i was impressed by everything I saw. We stayed for 3 days in the Hyatt hotel, very impressive, big, modern and provide excellent food. However i was really chocked from the quality of rooms. They are spacious, however the smell was extremely bad. The rotten humid air that flows from the air-conditioning system pollute the atmosphere of the room with very bad smell that made me feel sick. We were a very big group and every one had the same problem in his/her room. So changing was not a good option(although some have tried and were more disappointed). It is sad that the management of this hotel don't look at the facility equipment to make sure more purified air flows to the rooms knowing very well the level of pollution in the city.   It seems…"
3079,"Delightful hotel, with very professional and courteous staff. Breakfast was included and of excellent quality, with a very decent range of food. The room was quite small, and didn't include a chest drawers, but apeart from that the room was reat with a nice firm bed, good quality linen, along with a really good bathroom. I would recommend this hotel for a weekend in Paris, it is close enough to the main attraction to be an esy walk or Metro ride, but not so close that you fall over groups of tourists."
3080,"Me and my partner had an amazing stay at San Regis and we would both fully recommend this hotel to anyone who loves Parisian decor and a warm homely feel. Location is perfect, within walking distance is Champs Elysees, Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower. We fully recommend this hotel and look forward to returning in the near future."
3081,"This is definitely not a posh place at all. The place is not updated, clean or well maintained. The air freshener that is being blown 24/7 through the AC system is sickening. The service is bad they make you wait for hours to get extra coffee for the room. Be aware of charges on your room that you did not charge. Never again!"
3082,Was in Miami for a conference.  Room was disgusting.  Not vacuumed.  Wet wash cloth in shower.  Coffee grounds from previous guest still in coffee maker.  Would had made a fuss immediately or gone to a new hotel had I not had appointments right away.  The place was extremely understaffed.  Front desk only answered the phone half the time.
3083,"Private rooms have two big bunks beds and are clean. Bathrooms aren't always clean as rooms, but was a hosts problem, not an hostel problem. Breakfast is not free and is one of the most expensive​ hostel in the world, but find a bed in amsterdam is one of the most expensive affair in the world. "
3084,"We stayed at the Sana Berlin hotel for my daughter's 18th birthday. she has to visit Berlin so she could see the museums and the zoo for her birthday. Everything about the hotel was wonderful. Parking was easy, our two bedroom apartment was spacious and comfortable, and the employees we interacted with were very nice. On my daughter's birthday we visited Museum Island. When we returned we were surprised to find champagne for my wife and I and a piece of cheesecake for my daughter. What a lovely surprise. The hotel is close to the metro and we found it was very easy to get all around Berlin using their superb public transit system. The zoo is within easy walking distance too. Finally our checkout experience was maybe the best I've ever had. The woman working there was extremely…"
3085,"We chose this Hotel over others as it is advertised as 5 star. You judge if it is! It is clean, the staff are lovely but are run off their feet. We arrived around 7pm and had eaten in the lounge and on the plane so after unpacking just wanted a drink, we found the Coast bar and ordered two drinks which were served in minutes. Around 9.25 we ordered two more, the bar suddenly filled with people and we waited and waited. After 20 minutes I asked the waiter where our drinks were, it appears they have ""happy hour"" from 9.30 to 10.30 when drinks are half price but they only have ONE barman (Ricardo) preparing all the drinks for the whole bar!! Ricardo and the waiters are rushed off their feet and can't work any faster but we got our drinks after 35/40 minutes. 5 star? The hotel runs…"
3086,"This hotel has very good location to the city centre. We barely needed to take the subway as all city highlights were in walking distance. The fururistic look is a bit scary during day but in night it shines in colours. Rooms are rather small but equipped with all necessary things. Breakfast were sufficient corresponding to the price paid. Overall there is nothing to say against this hotel, it's a good choice for budget travellers looking for a well located property with good sleep and rich breakfast."
3087,"Stayed for 13 nights in the double room for a business trip. The trip was quite good and the rooms were changed on request when small. The Astotel mini bar(free) and snack bar is a great feature. While this is smaller than Hotel 34B, the bigger rooms make up for this. Great location-walking distance from most attractions"
3088,"Mold in bathroom, carpets in room dirty, Staff rude, room smells badly, cost like a 5 star Hilton - Felt like a Cheap Motel. Manager was to busy to see my troubles, felt like Bellman scamed us. Front desk has no idea...."
3089,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel a year ago as a time share exchange since we wanted to visit Miami. The place is terrible. Outdated décor, questionable cleanliness and yes, cockroaches. I found them every morning in our kitchenette, and my wife found one in the bathtub one evening. We couldn't leave this place fast enough. This hotel seems more like a party hotel. We even walked by abandoned beer bottles in the hallways. The pool is not that fantastic, and in fact, looked pretty dirty. The only plus is the location on the ocean, but quite frankly, I would pay more to stay somewhere else and have a longer walk to the ocean."
3090,"Our room (on deluxe floor) with an amazing view,  was very clean, comfortable and spacious, as was the bathroom. Good inexpensive parking though no lift from the lower levels, but in fairness the concierge will take your parcels and park the car for you.   The views from the 19th floor bar are quite spectacular and worth a visit.   Access to the motorway is good and there are some great restaurants in walking distance.  The bus also stops very close to the hotel and goes to the town centre as well as to Matosinhos with it's great beaches and fish restaurants in the opposite direction.  Taxis are plentiful and cheap and a car is not really needed.  However the loud edgy music constantly played in the lifts, reception and bar was annoying as was the length of time we had to wait…"
3091,Located just opposite one of Berlin’s main stations on Friedrichstrasse the location is superb. Staff were excellent as was the array of breakfast items available. Only one sour note - why two mattresses on the bed? They always come apart in the night! Just get kingsize beds instead!
3092,"This is our second time to Phu Quoc. We were looking forward to staying here as it’s an 8 month old hotel. We invited our friend to join us and suggested to stay at Intercontinental.   The hotel layout is confusing. The pool is on the first floor but the lobby is on the 4th floor. The room we had had the bed parallel and literally 4’ feet away from the main door. So if my husband was sleeping and someone was at the door, they would be able to see my husband in bed. There was no dividers. On our balcony was constantly filled with bird droppings. I hung my swimsuit outside and the next day - it had bird droppings on it. Yuck.   Our friend had so many issues during their stay, that I was so embarrassed. Their AC in one of the bedrooms was dripping with water. They told the front…"
3093,"The Good: big spacious family room with comfy beds, lots of plug sockets, clean and tidy. In a great location close to public transport and lots of shops the zoo and restaurants. In a quiet street . The Bad: room was sweltering hot with only a fan and no A/C, no tea and coffee facilities in room, not suitable for disabled guests as there are stairs and the lift takes you between floors.  The staff were all very helpful and friendly, and the breakfast was very tasty and plentiful although no A/C so very hot and sweaty. In the afternoon there were drinks and snacks put out  and they were free which was nice."
3094,"Private villa swimming pool dirty I didn't feel kind. I didn't hear any clear explanation at check-in. When I went to the restaurant, they forgot my order and didn't bring it. I do not want to go next time."
3095,"Good position, big rooms and great breakfast but......rooms a bit tired, bed poor for 5 star, but the worse thing is leaving at 7.30am leaving the clean the room light on, back at 4pm for 30 mins and because the room was not serviced/cleaned, I had 30 mins and no towel to take a shower with. Phoned to complain and there was a not committal response, had to go down 17 floors to reception to get action. Complained on check out and offered a bookmark!! Will not stay here again!"
3096,"Absolutely loved my stay here. Excellent service. Beautiful dark Victorian decor. Rooms are small, but very comfortable. The only problem was the charging outlet in there. Would have been wise of me to have taken a charger that would connect to their outlets. The one they have for any USB cable did not work well. The closet is small; enough to hang about four shirts, and place two pair of shoes on the shelf. I would love to stay here again on my next trip to Paris. "
3099,"Too many guests stays here.The executive lounge has nothing left for breakfast and we paid extra 10$ each, go down to 720S restaurant on the lobby. And waited around 45 mins in line until we had our breakfast.  ruined the plan of the day. "
3100,"I just stayed there the past week for a conference in RIO. The rooms are decent, equivalent of holiday inn in the US. the rooms were clean, but I saw a few big cockroaches roaming the halls (I even caught one on video). the rooms lack balconies, which I would be annoyed by if I had a beach view, but I didn't so it wasn't that big a deal.  The staff was another matter. I had a translator assigned to me for my conference and I needed her to go over my presentation for my talk. When I asked her to come up, the staff immediately stopped me and said that in order for her to come up, I have to pay 100 Reais and 5% of what I was paying her. I was very confused until I realized they were implying that she was a prostitute. It was very insulting.  oh the breakfast was very good."
3101,"This hotel appears to be a bargain given that it is in Miami Beach.  But unless you're very oblivious to near flophouse conditions, don't stay at Crystal Beach Suites.  First, the desk personnel can be quite surly.  Second, the rooms are (a) rather dirty and malodorous; (b) hideously decored in garish, tacky motifs; (c) the furniture is worn and uncomfortable.  The a/c system is a mystery.  The ""Health Club"" is very basic.  Parking is an add-on.  The pool is a throwback to the early '50s, the spa didn't work.   We used this place solely as a place to crash, so our endurance of its unattractive features was fairly limited.  They do offer a simple bagel/toast/cereal breakfast, which is nice.    Our advice is to pay the extra amount to stay in a recognizably better place,…"
3102,Still works perfectly. Easy and speedy check-in/check-out. Comfortable and calm reception and lobby area. Friendly staff all around. Spacious and clean rooms with good beds. Gave stayed at hotel before and will do so again.
3103,"The location is fantastic. It is only a very short walk from Kurfürstendamm and the Berlin Zoo. The train station at the Zoo is also perfect for sightseeing. Our room was very dated with a fairly small TV sunk into a wall recess. The art deco style was nice even though the furniture was old. The staff were all brilliant and I cannot fault anyone. The bed was very low with the usual, and annoying duvet, why must we have these things, we hate them! The bar was small but great, but beware if you are a non smoker, it is like an opium den with the cigar smoke. It is staffed by great people however who speak great English and are very friendly. The breakfast selection was very good and plentiful with enough staff around to make it an enjoyable way to start the day. The restaurant is…"
3104,"Big room with balcony, nice view, clean, great breakfast and kindly staffs. Location was very nice, near the center of Fira and also near from bus station.   From the airpost to teh hotal we booked the transfer with the hotel, but the last day we left to the airport by bus, for us it was the best choose and cheaper.   We rental a ATV and one day we went to Oia and the other one to lighthouse, black and red beaches.   The only negative point was the shower, very small space."
3105,"This hotel is overpriced for what you get. Outdated decor, smelly rooms(they smell like stale cigarette smoke), and....horrible shuttle service. We were told by hotel staff that the bus comes every hour on the hour for pickups to the hotel. We waited at 5:4pm,  and the bus drove by us, without stopping. After calling the desk, they told us the bus leaves on the hour. We waited 1 hour plus for a bus, while the other hotel shuttles came and went at least twice.  The hotel front desk staff was very nice, and helped as much as they could."
3106,"The Hotel Principe is ok, it is clean, cheap and well located and very convenient for the metro which is right outside the front door.  It is a little way from the main tourist area, but this can be reached easily by train or in about 10-15 minutes on foot.  The immediate environment looks a bit grim, the road outside is closed for roadworks, although we never saw anyone doing anything, and has all the appeal of a building site, but it really is ok.  The rooms were fine.  Reception was fine.  We didn't take breakfast, there are lots of cafes and supermarkets in the vicinity (no fridge in the room though!).  There is also no kettle.   In summary, it was fine.  Nothing more, nothing less."
3107,We stayed 5 nights in this gem of a hotel in the Latin Quarter. The staff are amazing - always welcoming and warm as very as being able to help with all enquiries. The hotel is exactly as described with charming rooms with a distinctly  french feel from a century ago. The breakfast was scrumptious -i could get seriously addicted to chocolate croissants and espresso. There is more than enough to eat with  beautiful fresh fruit salad and orange juice to start with as well as cold meats cheeses and jams to go with  crunchy baguettes. The hotel is in a fabulous location - we walked everywhere. There are also delicious restaurants nearby -just ask for recommendations  - you will not be disappointed. 
3108,"I was here for a business trip and had very few requirements else than being able to rest at night.    Let's begin at the check-in. I arrive at the reception and the two ladies keep on talking like if I did not exist, no ""welcome"", no ""good evening"" nothing. Such a nice experience to have the feeling you disturb the employees!  When finally they decide to do their jobs they vaguely ask why I am here and then ask for my card. My stay was already paid so I thought they just want to verify something. Then I go to my room, no help is ever proposed for my luggage. Later in the evening I notice that they charge me $150.- additional for incident. I don't discuss that but she never told me she' going to charge me and as a result I experienced heavy fees from my bank as it went under my…"
3109,"In centre of city, modern hotel with excellent rooms. Rooms are of a good size with first class amenities. Young staff but very willing and helpful. Provided useful information and help with sightseeing and m9ving around the city."
3110,"We stayed in a sea view double room for a week on bed and breakfast.  The room was small but clean and had a safe (15 euros a week for the key), a balcony with a couple of chairs and a small table overlooking the pool area and the sea beyond and had two single beds side by side with two duvets.  For the price we paid it was perfectly adequate and the room was cleaned daily (you can forgo cleaning for a 5 euro credit per day if you wish).  The breakfast show was a pain - if when you are on holiday you decide that you would like a late breakfast and go down at 9:30 (breakfast is there until 10am) then prepare yourself for 'The Breakfast Show' of staff banging and crashing around you and laying adjacent tables for lunch. If they don't want you eating breakfast at 9:30 then close…"
3111,"Room was booked as part of an Easy jet package which overall was good value. There were 4 of us sharing a room so it was always a bit messy with a fold out bed. However the room was large enough, clean, well serviced and more than adequate as a base. The kitchen was well equipped for any meals with an oven which not all self catering apartments have. Also there was a washing machine and drying rack. Some people have complained about rude reception staff but the man who welcomed us was very polite and helpful. reception did appear to close early though so I was glad that we arrived early afternoon. Was a bit further from the city centre than I would have liked but tube connections were very good. Others complained about the noise from the street but I slept very well and heard…"
3113,Had such a great stay here! The staff are lovely people. Also the Sacre Ceour is close by if you feel like going for a morning run. The location is ideal as it is near a metro stop. Kitchen is fully equipped and wifi working very well. I will definitely stay here again the next time I visit! Great value for money! 
3114,"We stayed here for a few nights. It was pretty empty when we were here, however we did not feel welcome by the management. We got the feeling that they would rather not have anyone stay so we left sooner than expected...and it felt great to leave.  Everywhere else we stayed everyone was so friendly. Don't know what their problem was! Can't say I will ever be back. You want to feel like your welcome...and you will not get that feeling here!"
3116,"I spent 4 nights at Eduardo VII with my boyfriend....the perfect place to visit Lisbon with a very special price if compared with other structures. The prices are very low, the rooms very clean (everyday change of the towels and perfect cleaning), the city centre is less than 1.5 km far (you can walk there through Avenida de la Libertade..very nice...or you can take a bus-one every 10 min- or with the underground)....what else??!! thank you so much, because with 25.00 Euros each per day we spent wonderful holidays. The only negative point: breakfast not so varied...everyday the same, even if always in huge quantity! but the sight from the 10th-floor restaurant balances this....VERY RECOMMENDED!"
3117,The staff was kind and friendly.The room was a little hot but clean and spaciois.  The bathroom was amazing.  Had a large relaxing tub.  It was located cloase to food and many of the Paris sightsI would totally stay here again
3118,"My boyfriend and I stayed in Lisbon for 2 nights and were eager to leave on our last day. Besides the hotel being in a great location, walking distance from the Praça do Comércio and the Time Out Market, which I highly recommend, I cannot think of any reason why I would stay here again. We took a taxi from the airport to the hotel, which is approximately a 20-minute drive and as we were advised after the fact should have cost us 11 to 15 euros. The taxi driver parked his car, stopped the meter and promptly went to take care of our luggage. Both my boyfriend and I had seen the meter stop at 11.40€. I prepared my money to pay him and when I handed him the appropriate amount he directed me to the meter showing 28€ and said that there is an additional fee for airport pick up and the…"
3119,"I've stayed in other Mandarin Oriental hotels before and this one isn't up to par in any way.  A few things:  1. Service: yes, they are attentive, but to the point of being annoying.  The gym attendant practically followed me into the women's restroom.  Everytime I walk into the lobby, 3 people run at me.  Enough already. 2. Food: absolutely no healthy options on the menu.  It's 2013, get with it. 3. Room: nice in design, but finished very cheaply.  I think this is one (of many) Chinese hotels using low quality sheetrock and other materials.  I'm really allergic to mold and think that may be the culprit given I've had asthma symptoms and noticed the strange smell and generally been very restless in the room at night.  I definitely don't plan to stay here again.  Also, the bed is…"
3120,"I used to book langham Yangtze river, but I was too late for this time, so I have to turn to this meridian due to its location is very close to my office and just our contracted hotel list.  The outside look of the hotel Is good nag so do the lobby, but the nightmares came to me from the the secon of checking in. I arrived the front desk by late afternoon and met a rush of checking in by a group travelers, it has taken my nearly 20 minuets waiting for checking in since their exclusive checking in counter for SPG member was quite spare.  The room was quite good but the air conditioner was  too hot, I did not notice it since I went out for meeting after dropping my luggage. When I back to sleep in night, it was too late, the hot air conditioner made me sleepless for overnight. …"
3122,"Not an awful lot to say about this place, it does what it says on the tin. Modern, clean and helpful staff, and in a good location for exploring Berlin either on foot or public transport.  I didn’t really have any issues during my trip, but any interaction with the staff was polite and pleasant, and all spoke good English.  My room was a bit too hot one night, and the air con didn’t seem to be cooling it down, but switching it off all together seemed to solve the problem.  The usual breakfast was up to standard, with a good variety on offer.  I’d happily stay again."
3123,"I initially arrived to the hotel late, because my flight was cancelled, they we're talking charging a late fee.  They tell you can't have visitors.  They keep track of each room and "" oh that's room 305"".  I charge you an extra guest fee, crazy!  The most most annoying part was we paid for a king deluxe, which comes with a pull out couch.. which accommodates 4 people.  When we get there. They weren't aloud to go up because it's all of a sudden a 2 person suit. And we had to switch rooms and we're charged a up charge fee.    They management team was rude, condescending, and lacked compassion. I would stay here again, and wouldn't recommend dealing with there hidden guidelines and fees."
3124,Great location and clear traces of better times. It is sad that they have not done some refreshing on this hotel. Service at places like the pool or restaurant is not high point Reception employees do their best but the hotel needs to invest a bit more to be a 5 (or even a solid 4) stars hotel. 
3125,"We stayed for a week late October as two couples on room and breakfast. I have rated the hotel as average (3/5) because of the restaurant in the evening otherwise it would have scored 4/5. I am so glad that we did not go for half board.  Location is lovely, looking over the town in the distance and having a direct ocean view.  Rooms reasonably well appointed with nice bedding and curtains although rooms of same grade varied with furnishings e.g. our travelling companions had extra seating and a larger screened TV (not a problem as we only occasionally used it to look at the news). Bed was good size and comfortable (had a comfort top on the mattress), decor was pleasant and clean, kettle and supplies of tea and coffee - would have preferred mugs to the cups and saucers provided…"
3126,For the price I paid I expected sth. different. Welcome was unfriendly as if they would be sick of guests. Concierge obviously hated her job. Rooms were nice and clean though. Located at the end of the happening.
3127,"This is for an ""executive"" room.  Rooms are what you would expect for a Sheraton.  Service is, alas, even worse than you expect for Brazil.  I asked for an executive room with a king sized bed, as I am taller than a normal bed.  Once here they do not seem to care that this is unavailable, and go so far as to tell me that I did not make such a request. Iris nit about the customer here, but whatever is easier for the staff to tell you.  Very expensive, over USD450 per night, and they can not even respect a reservation. Not worth the money."
3128,"Stayed here 1 night and 1 day for a business meeting. Nice clean hotel. Rooms are normal size, clean too. Good bed, good bathroom/shower. Good wifi, friendly staff and good breakfast. Facilities and coffee/food in conference rooms were great during the day as well. Hotel is not close to city center, but S Bahn is a 5 minute walk. Would not recommend for city trip, as it takes about 45 min to get to the inner city center. But if you need to be in the surrounding of the area of the hotel, this is a fine choice. "
3129,"The beachfront location is great, but a main street passes in front of the hotel and you can loudly hear cars and buses all the time because the window isolation is almost nonexistent. Also, there might be time for some renovations, the room looked outdated."
3130,"Hotel is located 700m from Place de la Concorde and 500m from Galeries Lafayette and Printemps Haussmann. Completely renovated with very spacious rooms (which is not usual for Paris hotels regardless of price). Free WiFi, tea kettle, mini bar. Stuff very polite and friendly. Prices are very normal, especially for the accommodation they offer. Recommendations. "
3131,"This Sofitel is in the Mitte district which is very centrally located to tourist sites, bus stops and subway stations.  The staff was great and very helpful.  The room was small but even though we are both tall people, we were quite comfortable there.  The bathroom and shower were quite nice.  Our only complaint was that the door to the bathroom is quite heavy glass so it was somewhat difficult to maneuver.  We would definitely go back to this hotel again.  The hotel is very inexpensive for what it has to offer."
3132,"Overpriced, over promised and under delivered.  Problems: No hot water. No wifi. Poor TV reception. Staff under qualified and careless. Resort, if it can be called that appears run down and dated. Rusty ceiling fans, dirty windows and basically needs a total ""overhaul"" and bloody good clean. Breakfast awful and dining room was filthy- noodles all over the floor and table clothes putrid etc etc etc. We paid $100, plus extra for late check out (5pm), but two hotels down we could of got the same thing for $55- Positives: On the beach. Manager came and spoke to me personally (but too late), were given 20% discount by manager the day we were checking out, that I had to argue hard for. (We only stayed one night).  Conclusion: I think in its day, this would of been a great place,…"
3133,"Stayed for 5 nights, 2 rooms which were supposed to be near each other, one for the adults and the other for teenage children. This information was given at time of booking with the hotel and confirmed by phone prior to stay. Check in was horrible. Our handicap accessible room was given to a pilot who was not scheduled to check out until 9pm. The second room was floors away, but with immediate check in. When we finally got into our accessible room around 9:30, had to make extra calls to get the shower chair sent up. Next day didn't start until after noon when room 2 could be moved closer to the accessible room. Asked for recommendations to eat. Sent, in the freezing rain with one hotel umbrella for the 5 of us, to a restaurant with stairs to access it (can't do stairs in a…"
3135,Truly comfortable & very well located.  Great breakfast (feast) and conversation with the hostess.  Sabine (hostess) gave great recommendations on what to see and directions.  Arranged taxi for early morning ride to the airport.  Top-notch!!
3136,"Located ca.3km away from city center (40 min. by foot). Close to Lido area and nice promenade. Rooms are fine - beds comfortable, balcony with seatings and small kitchinette with fridge are advantages. Cleaning could be better, but first impression was good. No aircondition maybe a drawback when you have room on upper floors - but then you have a tremendous view over the ocean and city. Mine was on 2nd so I did not mind much of high temperature. Breakfast -really boring, always the same. Dinner- fine, everyday different buffet  menu. Big minus for lack of airco in restaurant - very hot 'cos of plenty people. I didnot use their other services. Staff - nice. WiFi available only near reception (it would be nice to have it in rooms). I recommend them if you have other activities and…"
3137,"I recently stayed at the Generator Hostel (Stockholm) for 5 nights in late Mar early April 2019.  The hostel is located in a really good location only a 10 minute walk away from the Stockholm City central railway/bus stations, a 30 second walk to a local 7/11 grocery store, and a 5 minute walk to several good bars / restaurants.  Transfer time from Stockholm Arlanda airport is approx 1hr by bus or 15 mins by the Arlanda Express train (both separately reviewed).  Check in (13:00 onwards / check out 11:00) via the 24/7 manned reception was quick, simple, and even though I arrived early I was able to check in, which was a real bonus.  My top bunk bed (in a 6 person mixed dorm - 319) was very comfortable and there was plenty of room for both secure storage via a foot locker and…"
3138,"I attended a conference at this hotel for the second time in three years.  I had issues the last time I checked in and had them again last Tuesday.  On my reservation, I requested a high room, corner if possible with one single bed.  When I arrived the person at check-in was miserable.  Didn't care to hear my requests and told me that my room was not available yet (It was 6pm) and that it should be available in a few minutes and that they would call me.  I was not called until an hour and a half later and had to go back to check-in to re check-in.  The offered me their ""club"" as a sorry gift.  I really didn't need the club since I was there for a conference who provided breakfast and lunch.  When I got to my room I had two double beds in the middle of the hallway on the 14th…"
3139,"I was not sure what to expect. The price seemed suspiciously LOW, while the reviews on TA seemed suspiciously glowing. But WOW -- we were impressed! The lobby is like someone's lovely living room with a comfy sitting area and lots of reading material, and a desk. (like you'd have in your home office, NOT a big formal hotel counter) As we walked in, the woman at the desk said warmly, ""Ah, you must be -- and --- ..."" welcoming us by name. She proceeded to give us a map, and description of the neighborhood sights and some suggestions for restaurants, while another staff person brought us cool drinks. The elevator is tiny, but fast and quite charming looking -- old fashioned wrought iron. Our room was small, but plenty big enough for our two large suitcases and carry-on bags. There…"
3140,"It was above what we expected. Every little details were carefully thought. Not only the hotel was spotless, staff were utterly professional helpful and friendly.  The lobby the restaurant and the room were modern and stylish without clutter and fully functional.   The breakfast was outstanding with freshly baked items and lovely presentation, and a very wide range of food available.   The little things that made our stay even better? The ‘story machine’ (press a button and get a story!), the big TV, the real blackout curtains, the noise insulated bedroom, the mini drying pan to fry the eggs, the choice of several tasty jams, the fresh bread and croissants, the photo shoot box (print a free photo souvenir!). If we had the time we would have booked ourselves to the ‘escape’ game…"
3141,"Good location in a noble district 10min walk to main squares and Lisbon funiculars. Being a boutique hotel, privacy and personalisation are provided. Furnishings were beautiful and worth a design concept. Our room was well equipped, aesthetically nice and very quiet. We could appreciate the cleanliness and the tasteful decoration everywhere. The restaurant Sitio was excellent for dinner. Staff members were all young, very professional and always helpful. Staff members were in fact one of the highlights of the Valverde, except for recommandations. Some points need improvement tough:  -we would have liked a coffee machine and tea making facilities in the room, which for most quality hotels are now standard  -coffee was not good at breakfast -Recommendations for restaurants were…"
3142,"This is a modern, over trendy hotel which just doesn't work.  The rooms are modern and comfortable...........provided you want your partner to watch you sitting on the toilet!  The bathroom has glass walls and the blinds only cover one side.  The restaurant was truly awful with the worst service I have ever experienced anywhere.  The staff appear to have been taken off the street, given a uniform but no training and left to get on with it.  I even had to open a bottle of wine as the ""waiter"" didn't know how to use a corkscrew.  Avoid!"
3143,"We stayed at this hotel for a week in july.  The staff was always very friendly and helpful, and we really felt warmly welcomed. The air conditioning was effective and quiet. Good location, ten minutes walking distance to the beach.  We loved the breakfast and the free beach access (available if you book through the hotels website). There is also complimentary afternoon drinks with snacks - such a nice touch."
3144,"I traveled there for a business and the location of this hotel was ideal for me. I paid for about $180 + tax per night, for 5 nights, in the first week of May 2014.  Pros: A great hotel, with great facilities, clean rooms, and super friendly staff. For the price of less than $200, it is a great value. The location is near downtown and very convenient for everything. It would be a 4 star hotel if it had a swimming pool. (A pool is required by definition for a 4 star hotel.)  For the price I paid for, it would have been a a great value if it was not for the noise.  Cons: All those 1 circle ratings for noise reasons are still there. They do not go away 7 years later as of now. For me, a good night sleep is the No.1 requirement for a good hotel. That is the only reason for my low…"
3145,Loved the location of this hotel.  Rooms were good.  Breakfast was amazing. Champagne every morning!  We used the Ubahn often.  Enjoyed being away from the main city and yet easy to go anywhere.  Stayed 3 nights and loved it!  Would come back again.
3146,"This hotel was a bit of a let down. The room, facilities and location were reasonable, but the place is really let down by the unfriendly staff (apologies to the pool lifeguard and the receptionist at checkout to whom this doesn't apply). It doesn't take much effort to be pleasant, and it really does make a difference...."
3147,Madiera people great met plenty....one girl ana who we had just met insisted on running my wife and me to airport....the weather was great...we had shorts most of the time but people can get caught out it can be windy...new year's eve fireworks display in Funchal worth the trip alone..... spectacular...
3148,"The rooms were not clean, therefore we changed the room twice (which was so complicated, don't even wanna mention it here) and still not clean. The layout and design from the rooms were terrible. The room service fare was dreadful. And the room rate was quite high.  The place seems poorly managed and the staff poorly trained (and again nobody understands English, they couldn't even help us explain where the next MRT station is).  The only good thing for us was that MRT station is just 5 min walk and also Tianzifang (great restaurant area) is close by.  I would not recommend this hotel. You can find much better service and accommodation at a lower price elsewhere."
3149,"We would love to give this hotel a great review as others have done; however, our experience will not allow us to honestly rave about the Pestana Porto.  I made reservations for our 3 night stay months and months ago and requested a double room for my husband and myself, and believed, based on many Trip Advisor reviews we had read before booking, that we would be given a nice and comfortable room upon our arrival; I might add prior to our arrival, we had already joined the Pestana Priority Guest Club believing this card would benefit us during our 16 days of travel in Portugal staying at other Pestana properties.  That was a wrong assumption!  When we checked in on October 12th, we were assigned room 613, and lo and behold, that room was on the top floor of the hotel and was…"
3150,"Spent 4 nights in this lovely clean modern hotel beside a beautiful beach. Rooms were a good size with the most comfy beds and pillows.  Unfortunately it’s out on its own with no restaurants, bars or shops (other than a very small one beside it).   There’s a huge empty abandoned apartment block beside it which is a horrible eyesore and a closed down restaurant next door with a full dirty skip outside it and the weeds growing up through the footpath. The beach is its only asset and is really lovely.  We were lucky to get to spend one day on the beach as after that it was CLOSED!  I don’t know if travel companies are told this as if you stay at this hotel because of the beach and then you can’t avail of it then this is a disaster to say the least. There’s a lovely pool on the roof…"
3151,"The lobby is nice and welcoming but the rooms are ugly. Carpet is dirty and need change, room's furniture are ment for patio and not indoor. The chairs are from iron metal. I hit my foot and hurt so bad. Beds and bathrooms are ok. Other amnities like coffee pitcher and refrigerator are available in the room. There is no expresso machin like all 5 star hotel that I visited before. The elevator works on your card and it's a hassle if you don't have it with you to go up your room. We had our own car, they parked it for free. I would say the doorman was the nicest of all. "
3152,Dated hotel but had a nice feel. Room was comfortable but very small balcony and dated. Food was terrible. Breakfast was good though. Staff were very friendly. Good bus service into Funchal about ten mins away. Nice restaurants close by. Great for the money paid   
3153,"A great view from the rooftop pool. Nice enough staff, but they seem very overwhelmed. But frankly, I felt it was a little dirty. When I got in (which was a saturday night in Rio) there was a mystery stain on the mirror in the elevator. The next day it was gone, but... When the elevator doors opened to  my floor the door to the right was broken, dirty and hanging ajar. Very creepy. And I got no wifi service (which is not password protected) in my room. I switched the next day."
3154,"We really wanted to like this hotel; great location in town, great room, great staff. The problem: NO SLEEP due to INCREDIBLY LOUD people singing and yelling outside ALL NIGHT LONG to 6am!!!  We asked the staff if it was college kids just starting school, how many days this would continue but just got blank looks saying it was drunks from the bars across the street.   4th floor room facing Rua de Avis, windows closed, shades/curtains drawn, ear plugs in - three nights, no sleep.   Just a personal preference but it was an overnight hotel for big bus tours and we would have stayed elsewhere based on this alone if we had known this.  A different room, a different time of the year, different guests that would have been out there drinking/singing with them and maybe it would have…"
3156,We booked our honeymoon here and were promised a room upgrade and Champagne. When we went to check in the lady behind the desk said our room would be ready in 30 minutes and mid sentence she said never mind I have one for you. It was garden level across from the elevators and ice machine the carpet was peeling up and house keeping had missed a previous guests nasty wash cloth left haning over the shower. We had asked about the upgrade and she asked to see our marriage license. We were married Friday and this was the folowing Monday so there was no license available for her to see even though we showed her pictures and she was excited for us yet treated as if we were lying. Basicaly were put on a waiting list for an upgrade. An hour later we went back to the front desk and spoke…
3157,"The hotel is lovely, and it's proximity to both tram and train stops is great for getting into town. The rooms are modern and very spacious, as was the bathroom (which had a lovely bath and shower). Checking in and out was also quick and efficient and staff were friendly and helpful for the most part.  However, there were a couple of things which let our stay down. There was no mattress protector on the bed and the sheet covering the mattress was quite flimsy and often came apart where it was parted in the middle. This was really annoying and could make the bed uncomfortable at times.  On our first night we had dinner in the bar and the food was poor and very overpriced. Upon checking in we decided to pay for breakfast for our entire stay but it also wasn't great. The buffet…"
3158,We had an apartment in the hotel on the 3th floor. The elavator went to the 2nd floor. You need a key to open a special door between the stairs of the apartments and the hotel. So it's not that easy for the kids to go to other rooms where we had family. The apartment and the hotel was very pretty and clean. The stairways between hotel and apartment weren't clean (several weeks if not even longer) as we found dust webs between the plants and the floor. Always somebody at the desk and great breakfast! 
3159,"It's good for a short stay in Porto, quit far away from the river and beach and it's on top of the hill, so for people who are not good in walking it's not the best hotel, the staff is really nice and have good knowledge In English, nice rooms with everything you need. No gym "
3160,"Neat clean hotel not in the center, but with convenient transport access, metro station next to the hotel. Good breakfasts and comfortable bed. Friendly staff. I recommend this hotel for a short stay in Berlin."
3161,"Had a fantastic relaxing long weekend at The Level Melia Barcelona Sky!Pros:Stayed in the executive sea view double on The Level which was very spacious and extremely comfortable with superking bed, great pillows and a good hairdryer. Very clean and most of hotel is scented with lovely aroma. The complimentary drinks and snacks on The Level were very inviting and a welcoming bonus! Staff were extremely welcoming professional and efficient. Pool area was lovely and relaxing. Views from the terrace were terrific! Location pretty good, quiet location. It was a lengthy but pleasant walk to the beach.Cons:Mattress was a little firm for us. Shower could have been more powerful. Not happy with the lack of English speaking channels on the TV (loads of Spanish and German) The restaurant…"
3162,"Very nice hotel - we took a large room with double bed and two singles for the teenagers.  Very clean, comfy beds and bedding + a good shower.  The large windows (which open fully with low sills but have a tilt function to make them safe for toddlers, drunken husbands etc!).  Lots of building noise outside from the early morning when we stopped.  Not the hotels fault but you might want to check or get an inside room if a light sleeper or you want a lie in.  In our case the kids managed to sleep though it as always.  Breakfast a bit steep at €12 each - but no end of kiosks and cafes nearby.  U Bahn and tram about 5 mins away - or most attractions are with a mile or so walking.  Free Internet as well (and a half decent speed).  Definitely a good find and good value for the city in…"
3163,"I just read a few reviews and I must say that we had a wonderful stay! The location is great and safe. Our check-in was quick and we had a wonderful family unit. The hotel is very clean and all staff very friendly and helpful!  The check-out took a bit longer, but the young gentleman apologized immediately for the long wait.  The hotel is a magnet for business people and yes during a certain time of the morning the breakfast area is pretty full but still cosy and the food quality is great. Since the location is very central, certainly there is traffic and certainly there is some noise!  We would love to come back!"
3164,"As part of the Sheraton, I would expect that the buffet restaurant to be well managed. I had lunch with my friend there by using loyalty points. The reception seemed very helpless about the procedure. I have used my points many times, so I had to explain her how the system works. Frustrating!  The best part of the buffet was the Sashimi station, all other stations were average. The dessert station was a disaster. We had seen some really delicious cakes, so at the end of the meal we had saved some space in our stomachs. Guess what - the cakes on display were not part of the buffet… I have been to many buffet restaurants and I experience for the first time that something ON the buffet is actually not part of it. I mean, it doesn’t make sense! All was left were some rather not…"
3165,Great hotel - everything works as expected and close to everything you need. I have stayed there several times and enjoy coming back. Decorations are linked to 'Wall street' and the stock market - a find detail.
3166,"Small hotel as part of a wider chain that had 16 hotels in centre of Paris.  Price- very good value for the centre of Paris which is an expensive city  Price includes a continental breakfast, cereals, juice, hot drinks, pancakes, egg, sausage, bacon,  bread , yoghurt.  Location- conveniently located to Saint georges metro and Liege.  20min walk from Gard du Nord central station.  Rooms were a decent size not massive but enough.  Free soft drinks minibar in room TV, hairdryer,  safe and toiletries"
3167,"Everything about this hotel is wonderful. The welcome we received was friendly and the staff all speak impeccable English. The room was comfortable, clean, very well decorated and made such a good use of limited space making the room feel much bigger.  The room had complimentary toiletries, tea and coffee making facilities and a mini bar with a clear price list.   The breakfast was a very good spread indeed and they even provide breakfast in your room for no extra charge. We didnt do this simply because we aren't good at making decisions in advanced.   The location is excellent for exploring Le Marais or St Martins canal and its many surrounding bars and restaurants. It is only a 20min walk or so from Gard du Nord or a 5 minute taxi ride. There are 2 metro stops within a few…"
3168,"They tried to cheat me, and take money on tje crwdit card. If it sounds incredible, I'll be happy to send documentation. Of course, I'll report this. Stay away from them! Also, the room was incredibile little, the bathroom also, and without any ventilator. Obviously, the wifi is NOT free in The rooms!"
3169,Run down hotel from yeaster years. Not like old days.Rooms have been tried a makeover but poor.Not clean room very average.Very poor front office.Swimming pool needs maintanence badly. Spa is ok.Food very average.Spent 6000 for a day terrible!!
3171,"I've stayed at much friendlier and warmer hostels than this one. It felt like it was run very much like a business. Efficient service though, cheap and in a good location. So depends mainly on what you're looking for from your stay."
3172,"A stylish smaller hotel in the 15th. Within 20 minutes of all major attractions in central Paris. Very helpful staff, very clean, nicely decorated with good beds and bathrooms. Rooms are small but very adequate and many have balconies with good views of the Eiffel Tower. Nice room for breakfast, which is good, free wifi with laptops available to use in public areas. 2 minutes form Vaugirard metro with shops and restaurants near at hand plus a pleasant public Park and good underground parking in nearby public garage - fee payable. Very convenient for exhibitions at nearby Porte de Versailles exhibition centre. Just back from my third stay in three years. All good and excellent value. I shall return."
3173,"The Hotel Concortel is located very close to the hustle & bustle of Paris, yet in a quiet street a 5 minute walk away.  The hotel was very quiet, no noise of traffic, so a good night sleep in a comfortable bed in a clean a spacious room.  The managers (night & day managers) where always helpful and very friendly.  The day manager was particularly very helpful with our taxi from the Gare du Nord on our arrival. After we got into the taxi, the taxi driver had no idea where he was to take us and drove around for 40 minutes which should have been a 20 minutes journey.  I called the manager and he very kindly spoke with the taxi driver and in no time we were to the hotel. "
3174,"Booking online, we thought this location was going to be modern and sleek; however, showing up the photos totally fooled us. Every piece of furniture was run down, the room was extremely tight and small. The queen bed didn’t seem like a queen. I have a queen bed and this bed was much smaller than what I have. Unfortunately we wouldn’t stay again because of the size and the way the rooms look. Staff was friendly; however, there’s always that ONE person that ruins it all with their attitude "
3176,My experience at hotel ibis budget Rio was very poor. The breakfast is very expensive and poor. Room are very poor too. I don't like and don't recomended this place. Other hotel Ibis is very best at services.                
3177,"My brother and I recently stayed at HM for 3 nights and 4 days. We were given room 505, a front street facing view with a balcony.  Let's begin:  Reception We were greeted by a most welcoming reception from the host Danielo, from Italy. We had left our mobile phone in the taxi when we had got dropped off and he did everything he could in order to help us find it. He also worked to try and get us into our room ASAP as we had arrived at 9AM and wanted to check in early. We did check in by around 11AM.   The Room We had room 505 a double bedroom with a balcony and street facing view. It is a typical European size, which is quite small by my standards but was charming just the same. It did fit our 5 luggages and we we each had our own closets and bed sides. They do provide amenities…"
3178,"This was a really nice hotel but... First the good bits. Really good value, huge room with a nice (if slightly decrepit) bathroom. The breakfast was absolutely spectacular. The staff were very helpful. However, the location sucks. It's a lot closer to the airport than it looks and directly under the flight path for landing and takeoff. So there was a lot of noise except for a few hours after midnight. I woke ridiculously early every morning which is not good for holidays. Also there isn't much to do in the neighbourhood, which is a mix of residential and industrial but the location doesn't really encourage coming back late in public transport either. On that note, I'd recommend any solo female traveller not to use the Praca de Espanha metro to get to the hotel as the walk to it…"
3179,"If I had to sum up my stay, I'd say it was a bad decision. The hotel is over-priced, the service was terrible, and the reservation was non-refundable. The security guard was trying to be funny, the desk assistant wasn't helpful, my wake up call never came, my second key never came, and they booked me for a room someone was already occupying. She scared me and I'm sure I scared her trying to get in. "
3180,Stayed a few nights on business and it is a good standard of hotel that meets expectations. The breakfasts and lunches were of a good quality standard too.  It is right next to the main train station (so loads of taxis around and transport connections) and an easy walk to the Brandenburg Gate and Reichstag and also the Mitte neighbourhood establishments.
3181,"For $400 a night I was expecting more than what we got. The bed was terrible. We found it hard to sleep as we both got sore backs from the bed. There is no coffee machine in the room and I need my coffee to get going in the morning. The nearest place to get coffee was a 20 minute round trip. There are  no ice machines. Instead there is ""ice service"" @ $3 & tip ! There is no mini bar... just an old fridge in the room which was not working. Yet on the web site it still says that every room has a mini bar, When I asked I was told ""oh we no longer do mini bar service"". The food in the restaurant was expensive and of poor quality. The staff were very unfriendly and rather snobbish. Ironic considering we were paying guest and they were working there. Never again!"
3182,"Overall, the hotel was gorgeous and right in the middle of everything -- so perfect location! In regards to the area and the people, the days were busy and things came to life, the nights were pretty laid back and smooth. My room itself wasn't bad at first -- but after becoming settled in I realized that was a short lived dream The room wasn't dusted fully. The red chair in the corner had dust all over the arms and in between the cracks, on the head and behind the chair. Looking behind the TV was ten times worse, as if it hadn't been dusted behind there since the hotel opened. The crown molding was coming loose above entering the room just beyond the foyer. The left bed pillow with the embroidery on it near the window had mold on it. Both bed headboards had marks and even oil on…"
3184,"  Brand new hotel right next to the Mercedes Benz Arena. We stayed in a big room on the sixth floor, no noise from either inside nor outside and a very comfortable bed. The only downside was that wi-fi only worked when you were close to the door and not in the other end of the room. Very friendly and helpful staff indeed. We had no shampoo in the bathroom and I am not exaggerating when I say they brought it in less than 30 seconds from when we called. Breakfast was good, lots of choices both hot and cold. Can really recommend a stay here, especially if you're going to the next door arena, it's less than 50 meters away. Very good location."
3185,"Friendly staff with great service. The surrounding is quiet and peaceful. Very near to the Subway and there are a lot of bus stops and services that brings you around Paris. The one we fancy most is 95 which stop right at the foot of the slope, less than 200 meters from the hotel. It is a great place to stay in, away from the busy streets of Paris and yet within minutes by bus or subway. "
3186,"I stayed at this property for a business meeting and was impressed that it did not have the impersonal feel of many convention hotels. Excellent facilities including a well equipped health club, very nice pool with outdoor access and a bar and restaurant that were better than most  large hotels with convention facilities. The hotel is in a very good location to walk to many attractions and is close to the beautiful Tiergarten park and a very large outdoor beer garden across from the Spanish Embassy."
3187,"Found this through tripadvisor ratings and it seemed that it had better than average reviews...my experience told me otherwise.  Here is a summary of what we thought: -Horrible front desk that was deceptive by messing up our booking and not telling us about it, tried to sucker us into hotel arranged deals -Small rooms with a lot of sound coming in from the street (on the plus side their recently renovated) -Cleaning ladies that are shady and possible smoked in their office, which was located on our non-smoking floor (floor 4 in case the manager is reading this) -Poor wifi throughout including the lobby -No pool, no gym, both elevators weren't functioning the first day we got there  When we got into the hotel at 7pm we (a couple) were given a room so we went up and had the…"
3188,"Booked this hotel with booking.com  . on arrival we found a sort of reception on the ground floor but was directed to some lifts and told to go to level 19. we asked if there was another way up as my wife won't go in lifts and was told to check with reception so I went up there myself, found a young fellow behind a desk and asked were the stairs were to walk up. He told me there was only stairs we could use from the 13th floor up so we never got to see the room and ended up walking the street of Chicago for hours looking for a room. Booking.com should advise that this is a hotel on the 19th floor with access via lift only as there are many people who are not comfortable in lifts and we never would have made the booking had we been made aware."
3189,"We stayed for 3 Nights on New Years 2014/15. It was a great stay, we definitely loved the breakfast, they had a lot to choose from and a great coffee machine... The staff was quite friendly as well. The room itself was actually made for someone that is handicapped, but we didn't mind... Great big windows, we could see the Rosenthaler Platz from our room, not for people that sleep light, when the tramway goes by the whole room shook (haha).   All in all, for the price we payed, we had a great stay."
3190,"No words to say how much a liar and these comments, I've been staying at the Adelaide Hostel, polite staff bad, stole my cell phone iphone 5s, I informed the owner known as PJ, arrogant, not looking at our face and said he could do nothing.  Dirty rooms, with many badbugs, cheap, and many people, a dirty kitchen, with refrigerator stench of old food, and the only thing good location, close to Union Square. Beware, do not be fooled by the comments, you reserve in Adelaide send you to the Dakota, or vise verse dirty place both hostel.No words to say how much a liar and these comments, I've been staying at the Adelaide Hostel, polite staff bad, stole my cell phone iphone 5s, I informed the owner known as PJ, arrogant, not looking at our face and said he could do nothing.

3192,"We could not wait to get to our favorite island -Maui    When we entered Unit 502, we noticed it had a very strong nasty mildew odor.  After housekeeping tried to clean the air and failed, we  moved to Unit 315 and it was worse.  Management and staff pretend not to know . They do not admit there is a serious problem.  We are timeshare owners at this resort and were very disappointed that we had to be exposed to this.  However we enjoyed the newly changed restaurant.  Loved the nightly entertainment and pool."
3193,"I stayed at the hotel last week. And it was nothing like I expected. Upon check-in, I was met in a cold and rude manner.  The room was spacious but the safe was not fixed to anything! The bed was not comfortable and the pillows looked more towels folded than pillows. I can not say I had a good night's sleep. But the worst was about to come. After a long flight (Australia to Brazil) all I wanted was to be able to rest a little in my room, but even that was not possible.  The hotel was renovating some other floor and it sounded like it had a jackhammer in my room. I called the front desk and they told me that the noise would stop after 5 minutes. Really stopped. To restart after 10 minutes and last for another two hours. After lunch, the same problem. A joke! A bad joke! I never…"
3194,"Very accommodating hostel. We were overbooked in another hostel and Pegasus allowed us to check in at 11pm, to a room for 3 people at the rate we would've paid in the other hostel. Very friendly helpful staff. Cheapest bike rental in Berlin too. Would recommend!"
3196,"The position is very good: just a few steps from Plaza de Mayo, but the hotel has two big problems. First of all, the bad smell coming from the bathroom is very intense, even if you keep the door locked. Secondly, rooms are extremely noisy. The nise from outside of an electric power generator goes on all day and night long. We asked to change room, but the gave us another room on un upper floor still on the same side. The noise was exactly the same. For any other stuff, staff was helpful and kind. Brakfast was ok. Rooms were spacious, but curtains were old and poor. In the end, I would not recommend this hotel to someone else."
3197,"Чистый,спокойный отель..полные 3* Clean hotel with nice personnel. Temporary a part is under reconstruction(refreshment)),but it does not disturb It was my first trip to Berlin.The location of the hotel is convenient,as it is close to metro station. The budget shops are around"
3198,"GOOD POINTS  This hotel has a good location It looks good  The guy that checked us in was great  BAD POINTS  It is not value for money and some of the staff are rude.  I paid 315 euro for a 1 night room only stay (I don't think this was a premium room) which was a lot more than any of my other friends at the hotel. When I mentioned this, and the fact that rooms were currently on Expedia for about 100 euro less for the same night, I was simply told 'that's the way the booking works', 'ADE is on'. I came away feeling ripped off and wont be returning."
3201,"We stayed here as it was very handy for the Ku'dam, Zoo area, and central for the excellent Berlin transport system. The hotel is well decorated, our room very nice, comfy bed, decent showerroom. Breakfast was excellent and included in our very good rate."
3202,Stayed here in 2018.  Nice Hotel great location easy walk into the centre of Berlin so new it was ideal for us.  Reception great rooms good and clean  Breakfast big choise with plenty of seating. If you need coffee be prepared to wait 2 machines for all so on a bad day say 10min for a coffee at breakfast. Staff waiters not that dynamic and the bar before 7pm you can wait days for the bar man to turn up.  Ask at reception to give him a kick. Overall nice Hotel need to step up on the waiting staff
3203,"There is not much to say, but there is growing mold under the bed and under the sink, the hallways smells like mold and i will never ever come back here!! Please do not chose this hotell! We booked 3night but we left after 1! We weare not able to live here anymore! Please, please! I beg u! Do not ever come here!!!!"
3204,"We have faithfully returned to the Amrath year after year for 12 years most years twice a year. For my birthday and my husbands birthday. Whilst there are many other choices of very good hotels at similar levels and price brackets , I like a pool of which there are few in Amsterdam. However over the years the quality has gone down and down . This stay was actually in part complimentary to recompense for many issues during our stay last year. Credit to the hotel they did allow us to cancel a reservation in October and move it to now as I was unable to travel due to chemotherapy treatment. Our arrival was promising despite the room not being ready it eventually was at 3pm. ( this is the check in time ) We arrived to a decent sized room and macaroons and champagne. The room was…"
3205,"Booked this when we were on the Island when I realised I had made a mistake with another hotel. On the internet, it looks modern and luxurious. We booked a suite, and it was certainly a large room, great balcony with lovely view and sounds of the ocean, huge bed and lovely bathroom. But for me, and this is my personal opinion.... it was only looked good on the surface. it looks like someone has tried to make it look expensive and cut costs all along the way. A plastic stool in the shower, no bathroom extras (there was only soap and a shower gel dispenser). For a suite, it was a large room, without the extras you would expect. There were electric black out blinds at the 2 big windows, but at a smaller high window, nothing.... topped with the glitzy lights shining all night.....…"
3206,Old fashioned hotel  I was disappointed by the breakfast (quality and taste) and the dinner buffet (same reasons). View vegeterian option + bad coffee which is not understandable in a 4 star hotel in a country where you get good coffee everywhere.
3207,"We stayed at the Conservatorium for our recent trip to Amsterdam.  We were here for a business meeting, but mostly for pleasure.  We booked a duplex suite for our three night stay and the price at 700 euros per night, was not cheap.  The lobby is huge, and very bright with great natural lighting from enormous floor to sky high windows, but the furnishings missed the mark by a lot.  The sofas and chairs all looked modern and hip, but they were too low slung, and not comfortable.  The decor is great if you are posing for a photo shoot, which is entirely possible at this place, but it's not great for any real kind of relaxation or comfort.  Similarly, our room, a duplex suite, at first seemed perfectly lovely.  Natural light poured in through gigantic double height windows, while…"
3208,"Definitely a contender for least bang for your buck. We arrived after a late flight at around 1am. Was surprised that no one came to help take our luggage from the car, was even more surprised when the door to the hotel was locked and no one was around to let us in. I ended up ringing the doorbell and banging on the door for a good 10 minutes until a member of the cleaning staff was kind enough to let us in.   Got to reception to check-in and again there was no one there. I had to literally shout until someone came to help us.   The room itself was sparse and uninteresting.   Peculiarly,everything in the bathroom seems to be about three quarters of the size of a normal bathroom, and about half as comfortable. Highlight of the bathroom however was that one of the 'fresh'…"
3210,"Booked two connecting rooms as a family, both spacious (although ‘standard’ type) with all amenities, The location is handy for shops and restaurants, but not for tourist attractions such as Museum Island, and staff friendly and courteous. We did find the cleaning of the rooms rather sketchy for such a large hotel, but would definitely stay again should we return to Berlin."
3211,"Opulent lobby, nice but character-less rooms.  Extremely overpriced restaurant (coffee $15/cup, wine $22/glass etc.)  Very hard bed with stiff pillows made for an uncomfortable sleep). Half the restaurants and common areas still not open (hotel has only been open a month).  The lounge area was beautiful but we were the ONLY  guests two nights in a row.  Depressing. Stay at Les Suites Orient...way way better."
3213,"This hotel was awesome! Aside from one issue... it was filled with guests from the   organization Israel United In Christ, in town for a conference. This organization is labeled as a hate-group by the southern poverty law center. I'd recommend Hilton doesn't allow groups that are designated as a hate group to stay in their hotels. I had no incidents with this group, but nobody should have to stay in a hotel with a group like that."
3214,"We had a front studio on 2nd floor with french balcony. The double glazed windows shut out most of the street noise. It is in the heart of action...busy but a real buzz about it. We love just stepping out and turn left you head down to the Marina...turn right you go towards the Square. So much to see...hop on the tour bus and you can get to any part of the city... The apartment itself is clean, modern and perfect for us as a couple. The world famous market is almost opposite...great for a visit ,however quite expensive. We found shopping in the supermarket, which is only a five minute walk from the apartment suited our needs and pocket book. Similar prices to UK. The Metro is only a short distance. After our evening meal we would step out into a city which is alive with a real…"
3215,"Visited Air In and although the rooms are exceptionally small the hotel itself if lovely. It is situated in a great location which is close to everything you need, buses, trains and shops. There are also a couple of outstanding restaurants close by, we went to the chinese next door twice and had the best meal you could ask for.  There is a nice Italian over the road and an Indian restaurant round the corner.  You could not ask for a better location, just upgrade your room size, there is no room to swing a cat in the standard size.  The staff were polite, although they do not go out of their way to be helpful.  The breakfast was adequate and just what you would expect.  The coffee though was outstanding.  There are no kettles in the room so if you want one take a travel kettle…"
3217,"Very convenient location, stores and restaurants are very close. Metro stop 2 blocks away. Service is great and the staff is extremely helpful and will book and advise on various sites to visit. The lead person at the desk, Idir Mazzari, was especially helpful and friendly (see photo). The rooms are small by American standards, but there is a storage room for suitcases. We have stayed there 3 times and will stay there again. Rooms on the street side have nice views of the activity of the local markets, but set-up of market stalls starts early in the morning."
3218,The hotel was part of a Secret Escapes package deal. It was beautifully designed and furnished and the staff were its best asset by far. The setting is quite remote if you want to explore other parts of the island of Madeira and you definitely need a car. The hotel had several bars but they all charged different prices and it was expensive for Brits because of the sterling/euro exchange. The hotel and the package offering failed to inform us that the marina road was closed which effectively meant that the choice of other bars and restaurants was pretty much unavailable as the businesses closed down during the road closure. Felt cut off and remote. This is absolutely fine if you wanted to relax and chill out as that was about all that was possible. Unfortunately despite this…
3219,"Overall decent hotel.  The good: gave us connecting rooms which we needed, great breakfast and decent managers reception although crowded.  Rooms are nice sized and quiet.  The ok: lifetime diamond doesn’t mean much here.  Front desk staff was helpful, concierge ok, executive lounge staff really didn’t do anything but point you to someone else (unlike most Hilton’s).  Pool area is nice but very crowded and if you’re from US or other more prudish country don’t be surprised to see more than appropriate for kids as people use sauna and other areas.  Listo lounge service was very slow and food cool when it finally came although manager did make attempt to make it right.    Location is great."
3220,"While the hotel is well located one block from the beach, the 'service' is appalling. The guy that checked us in was argumentative, and I had to ask for our room to be serviced one day because it looked like our whole floor haf been forgotten. The 'included' breakfast is abysmal and not worth eating. We paid top dollar to stay at this hotel due to it's location, but I've come to the conclusion that if thr property is 'by Hilton' then I won't stay there. "
3222,"Beautiful hotel, fantastic staff but room overlooked a building site and we had a wall right outside our window - so no view at all. For the price we did not have value for money and felt disappointed. "
3223,"My Husband and I have just returned from a 5 Night stay at this super friendly Hotel. The Location is great as you can walk to everything that Cannes has to offer.  The Old Town is beautiful, you can take the little train but we walked only about 10 mins. Also, the train Station (very modern) is less than a 2 minute walk away! We took the train to Grasse and Antibes both stunning places to visit and if you like Perfume as I do then Grasse is the place!! The Hotel is small and very efficiently run plus  all the staff are so helpful, nothing is too much trouble.  A special mention to Patricia and Gail on Reception - who always smiled and chatted when we passed by Reception. Breakfast was good and a nice start to the day. The hotel is spotlessly clean and the bathrooms are new and…"
3224,"We stayed three nights in this hotel. The location is great, close to the museum district. But our room was really tiny. Besides, while it may be a matter of personal taste, we found the hotel style to be pretentious and over-the-top (e.g. very dark, club-like music in the restaurant, etc.)."
3225,"When you make a reservation in a Sheraton you have an expectation of a certain level of class and manner. And you apparently have at first sight. But then the front desk is poor in information...ok.. she is in busy day...then....you can get yourself informed in your room reading if you are willing to. There are a number of services that I am not sure they are ""really"" available...Gym(old and hidden), Starwood's Club not sure where it is...AND... Sheraton provides two types of internet, 2MB speed (yes, they do that) complimentary, and the real one at 30Mb speed for R$ 50 (about US$ 15) and once you left a security deposit it is already one finger mistake away. The room itself lacks renovation, (hello! bath tubes are old stuff, pipes that mix hot and cold water need to be fixed)…"
3226,"Let me first start off by saying you can not beat the location. It's right in the center of Oia 5 min walking distance from the shops and restaurants and all the typical spots to watch sunset, yet the hotel itself is very quiet despite being so close to the hustle and bustle. You don't even have to fight the crowds to watch sunset because you have a pretty stellar view of it from your balcony. We had our own large terrace in room 17 that had the best view.  Now on to what just made this an OKAY experience. First when we arrived despite coordinating the airport shuttle through them, there was no one available to help us with our bags. So we had to hike with very heavy suitcase on a mostly uphill path made of cobblestones. The wheels on my husband's bag were completely destroyed.…"
3227,"You cannot be staying in a better location in berlin than this hotel. I guess you are paying top dollar for the location.  The hotel is really classy and you will feel under dress if you are not in a shirt and pants.   Service is what you will expect from a 5 star hotel. I really like the nice little touch of providing a overnight shoe polishing service which not all 5 star hotels provide.   My only problem with the hotel is the breakfast. Staying here for 4 nights, the breakfast selection is the same throughout with no changes in some of the menu. There are some rooms with a wonderful view of the gate, so do ask the waitress for those tables. Also, they do have a tea menu but you have to specifically ask for it - i will prefer them to show it to me rather than me having to…"
3228,"Remember the scene from Dirty Dancing when the hotel manager says that times are changing and they won't be around much longer cause they have an outdated product? Ojai Valley Inn and Resort is that place where the glory is fading, and most of its staff seems ok with finding more ways to sink the ship more quickly.  This place is a disaster in its soft product. The beautiful property and views do not make up for the lack of service one receives for staying at this property. When I arrived, several bell staff appeared disinterested in providing assistance luggage -- which is fine until you find out you pay a $8.50 porterage fee and you actually don't have anyone to help you with you luggage.  The property is large and it can be a challenge to find your room. Mine was down a hill…"
3229,"Nice hotel, central, friendly staff. Clean and spacious room. Very good breakfast, but the restaurant was crowded and small, difficult to seat four people. A hotel bar, but not very charming. Very dark rooms, a major drawback. "
3230,"We had a wonderful visit at your hotel. The junior suite we stayed in was incredible, immaculate and very spacious. We were within walking distance to many wonderful affordable restaurants. There were 3 metro stations minutes away. The breakfast was nice and Sandra was very helpful.Sophie in reception was very kind, warm, and helpful. The only negative was the bathroom was in the basement with a curvy spiral staircase. We should have been informed of this when making our reservation. Too bad because it was the nicest hotel bathroom I have seen with an incredible shower. We would stay here again in a minute."
3231,"Beware - this property looks great in all the photos - it is not. Although situated directly across a VERY BUSY road from the beach the hotel is not at all insulated from the constant street noise. A constant stream of buses, taxis & motorbikes tooting their horns day & night. And the horrid music from the loud speakers that are placed along poles all along the seafront. On top of the Asian singers in the bar downstairs. We had a sea view balcony room. And the views were great. But the window/ sliding door did little to cut down on the outside chaos. Clearly only single pane glass. If you're looking for a restful / peaceful stay - go elsewhere. The breakfast area was small for the size of the hotel. It was dark and dingy. Food selection was average - however most was cold. Lots…"
3232,"My fault, I did not research the hotel enough. It looks cool online, but that cool disappears the first morning when you have to fight for an (OK) buffet with coach loads of German pensioners. not my idea of fun, first thing in the morning.  I tried to join the same people to watch an important Champions League game in the bar, however, being alone, and not on an all inclusive deal it was impossible to get the attention of the bar staff to order (and happily pay for) a beer. The bar area is too small to hold a kiddies disco/karaoke and have people watch a football match - not ideal for either party. I did not venture back to the bar.  Please note that it is a good 30 minutes walk to the town centre - the first part is not pleasant at all. I found myself driving to town most…"
3233,"One elevator only working during the weekend and creating a hassle among the guests who waited ages for the lift to reach their floors. If you are allergic, avoid this hotel. carpet is infested by mold. I started sneezing the moment I entered the room."
3234,"The hotel was very clean and decorated beautifully, staff were very helpful. Location was great and we discovered some beautiful shops and cafe around and it was 10 mins walk to catch the hope in hope off bus. Thank you  Amal"
3235,"We booked 2 double rooms for a 3-night stay. Very good value, nice and quiet, brilliant buffet breakfast. Very convenient location for trams, buses and underground links. Great value for family of 4. Staff at reception very efficient."
3237,"Location was good, close to the center but no noise. The beds were very good and clean. There is some entertainment in the evenings which is nice! There is a weird common area which is where you find reception, lots of tables and a bar, however you cannot eat there. I wanted to work and snack during lunch time but I was not allowed because they had a bar - but the bar was closed for the next 2h!  The toilets don't appear to be cleaned for a few days (they group people checking out on the same day and then clean which meant that the toilet in my room  was not cleaned for 3 days). The room where I stayed on the first night was REALLY small. The breakfast is not buffet and you can choose from around 8 options and you pay if you want extras. The drinks are only tea, coffee or a…"
3238,"The staff was great, knowledgeable and willing to help to make our stay the best it could be.  Congratulations to the management on creating a great hotel.  We especially want to praise Abduo and Johann.  As we entered our room, the high ceilings and spaciousness were impressive.  Both the main room and bathroom have their own air conditioners and can be controlled remotely. The bathroom was divided into 3 spaces, a central place with basin, large mirror, hair dryer, etc., a private commode with door and standing shower.  The standard shower has a rainfall style head and separate wand that makes it very convenient.  Our room's windows were in the bath area, one of which could be opened.  curtains are provided for privacy when you want it.  We had a view of the patio/courtyard…"
3239,We had never stayed here before and say a Groupon Special that we decided to take advantage of.  I reserved a Grand Suite (we had 4 adults total) for two nights received confirmation that the room would be available.  When we checked in on Dec 27 we were given a key to our room. We want up to our room and were surprised that it was a king room.  As soon as we opened the door the phone was ringing it was the clerk at the front desk.  She informed us that the Grand Suite that we had purchased was not available and she would give us a $50 refund for the evening.  It's pretty hard to put 4 adults in one king bed so I went to talk with the clerk.  The only other option was to either move to a double room or purchase another room for my adult kids to stay in for $99.  We purchased…
3240,"The property is in a quiet neighborhood, close to subway station and the famous charlie checkpoint.  The location is really nice and easy to explore the city on foot.    It is a little bit tricky when driving to there.  The GPS showed restricted road when approaching the property.  The parking lot is behind the building, opposite to the Lidl supermarket.  The parking is underground secured.    The suites is really comfortable and very nice for a family with child.  The kitchen facilities are also great for making an easy breakfast.  The bed is comfortable and the bathroom amenities are great.  Need to mention the self-service laundry in the basement.  There're only two washing machines and one drying machine.  We've really waited a long time to get our clothes cleaned."
3241,For a 2.5 or 3 star hotel the H2 punches above it’s weight. Rooms are small but very clean and highly functional. Not an inch of space is wasted. Who needs a coffee machine in the room when you have a 24 hour restaurant available in the lobby. Staff are so friendly and nice. The breakfast is a good continental. We stayed here twice and both times were very happy with everything. The price of the hotel was very good value. The location was great.  
3242,"This is brand new hotel but ventilation system in the room is poorly designed, blankets are too heavy for San Diego weather, in the mini-suite that we had 1 bed was sitting in a corner with little or no air movement and there is only 1 vent outlet in a huge room that cannot circulate the air throughout the room, and it's somewhat noisy. Front desk staff offered to switch rooms but we didn't think it would help since ventilation system looked the same in all rooms, however they gave us 2 coupons for free breakfast ($32.40 value after sales tax) and eventually credited for 1 night charges (out of 3 nights stay) because of our dissatisfaction with the room."
3244,I have been very comfortable in Comete Hotel. Very nice and tidy rooms. And the staff very helpful. My daughter and me needed a break and we could not choose better. Amazing the silence and respect to intimacy. Breakfast: seemed home made. Thanks for making us happy.
3245,"Hilton Hotel Buenos Aires is definitely not worth the money we pay. It looks wonderful from the outside, great location but when you get inside the room you get the feeling of a cheap hotel. Rooms are small, no power points beside the bed, INTERNET is HORRIBLE, hotel staff aren't really helpful, dirty Bathtub... to name some of the negatives. The staff boast that this is the best hotel in Buenos Aires, but there are better hotels better priced better located than this. Unless you want to spend more money or like to stay around Puerto Madero stay away from this...."
3246,Decent double room but very noisy courtyard where voices travel. Very dirty kitchen - not happy to cook there. Immediate vicinity seems safe in the day time but less so in the evening - I would be cautious about walking back after dark. If you don't mind being kept awake at 2am by people in the corridor/courtyard then this is the place for you. Sadly common courtesy is rather rare on the backpacker circuit.  It's a shame because if the dirty kitchen and noise issue could be addressed then  it could be very good.
3247,I was a bit concerned before we arrived as I had read the bad reviews but I really loved the look of the hotel. When we arrived we were really pleased and we asked at reception for a room here her up and with a balcony as suggested in the reviews. The lovely lady on reception was very helpful and said that was no problem and looked for us....the one Available was a double with two beds pushed together which was absolutely fine for us A’s not the sort of thing to worry us too much.  My partner went down for breakfast the next day and was a bit disappointed as they hotel dooesnt have a kitchen so only cold pastries and chilled snacks.  I wouldn’t pay extra for breakfast as the hotel is so close to some beautiful pastry and coffee shops for a much more satisfying breakfast.  The…
3248,"Yes,when you get there the view is superb but that is it.Access is very difficult for older people with luggage as there are many steps.The studio we had booked was too small to open our full sized suitcasas except on the bed and furnishings and bathroom were extremely basic.There is no restaurant on site and so as our terrace was too small it had to be served by the pool in the cold morning hours when the hotel is in the shade and has not been reached by the ealy morning sun.The breakfast is pretty basic and is prepared in the pool bar measuring maximum 2metres by 1.5 metres.Breakfast was cold when it arrived.The hotel does own a restaurant, Byblos several hundred metres away,again up the steps and we had an excellent dinner there.There is no way that the nightly price of over…"
3249,"This hotel is located 2 minutes walk from the train station and is on a direct line to the airport. It is also on a direct train line to the Cube Conference centre for those attending conferences there.  The rooms are small but clean. The beds are comfortable and there is coffee maker in the room. The bathroom is spacious and has a rainfall shower. There are no english channels on the tv. Breakfast has a good selection of hot and cold food. The restaurant opens most evenings and has a good choice of steaks. Staff were very friendly and helpful. At the time of my stay, building works were ongoing next door.  Ku'damm is a lovely location - the zoo is on your doorstep and a large selection of shops catering for everyone. It is 10 minutes by train to central Berlin.  Would…"
3250,"It's my third stay at this wonderful hotel. Perfect place to stay for a couple of nights when visiting Berlin.  Everything is eco friendly and the breakfast buffet is made of local bio products...what a great idea.  The rooms are spacious, bright and very clean.  Wifi is not free which I didn't mind as I can do a hotspot with my phone.   I will def return for my next Berlin visit. Highly recommended "
3251,"Whilst downstairs is beautiful in decor once you squeeze into the tiny lifts you realise the luxury has gone. The room was tiny, shower taps came off in your hand and the headboard was never attached. I would not rate this as a 4 star hotel. I could hear the next room. The air con doesn't work and it was boiling when we visited in winter."
3252,"Travelling solo for conference at Westergasfabriek, therefore booking this hotel make sense because of proximity - about 25 mins walk. Pros: Clean smoke free rooms, quiet nights (bonus marks), comfortable sheets, good price, free wifi in room Cons: Bus trips out to city central (about 15 mins, not counting waiting time for bus), lack of nearby convenience stores or restaurants/ pubs, no coffee or kettle in room, no iron in room, no paper or pen in room, bathroom door cannot lock."
3253,"I stayed here in May for 3 nights. Good looking hotel inside with friendly staff but new and has some teething issues. Potential to be a great city hotel in good location. Reception is always busy, curtains didn't close and cover all the light. Room key kept deactivating. Worse still I have been charged £300 since i have been back (7-10 days after) in 2 transactions I have no idea what they relate to. As always you call the hotel reception and whether you're a guest or not they're too busy to answer. I didn't even complain about the issues until none of our keys worked and the cleaner let us in (slight security concern!). She then called reception who sent someone to the room. I explained the issues described above, the guy said he'd drop in a few complimentary drink vouchers…"
3254,"The hotel is okay. They had some nice touches e.g. they wrote on my mirror birthday wishes & its only a 10 min walk from the station and views over a small marina. However, checking in was a mess. Slow & seemingly incompetent staff who were, not rude, but not bothered. For some reason we only had one towel in our room for 2 guests but when we told reception she barely believed us - why would I make that up! Breakfast was okay but I had to queue for the coffee for about 10 mins. Once at the front, the waitress moved me aside to fill up the 2 machines - could she not have done one at a time. She didn’t even apologise or look at me. The star of the hotel was Ian (training on reception). Polite, funny & helpful. I won’t be rushing (ever) back to this hotel."
3255,"It was wonderful experience and ambiance of the histel, locker system is cool and handy. Washrooms v satisfactory  but staff was v friendly and cooperative. Loved my stay overall !! Breakfast needs some improvement, plus laundry service should b available for all the guests with lesser charges"
3256,"Pretty much a generic hotel with a great price point and easy access to all sites . Not particularly beautiful or friendly but great for the 4 of us with 2 bedrooms,  a kitchen, common room and 2 bathrooms . "
3257,"I've being in this hotel with my girlfriend and other three couples of friends for the world beer fair. The kitsch decór is interesting, even if the furniture isn’t quite new and starts to shown signs of wastage. The rooms are enormous which is always nice in a trip. Unfortunately the cleanness was not ok when we checked in, with visible grubbiness left behind by the previous guests. The blackout was very poor and the light enters the room as soon as downs. For me, this is a main issue! The front desk is attentions, but the cleaning lady has entered our room even after we told not to. She closed the door and then opened it again to take “another look”, which is inadmissible. A poor service and impolite staff. A shame."
3258,"Following visiting Berlin several years ago we had an opportunity to make a revisit to the city. We looked at hotels on various websites and came across the “Hotel Angleterre” while booking our flight from London as part of a package with the airline. The hotel was located very close to “Check Point Charlie” and a very short distance from the “Kochstr. /Checkpoint Charlie, U Bahn Station” giving us easy access by public transport from “Berlin Tegal Airport” with one change from bus to a direct U Bahn train. We were checked in efficiently by a friendly and helpful man on the reception desk. Our room was located on the 3rd floor and accessible by lift towards the rear of the building and found it to be clean, spacious, and comfortable and well soundproofed allowing us to have…"
3259,"I had room 122, which is spacious, modern, and large for Holland standards.  I was a little disappointed there was no tub, but the comfy bed made up for it.  The staff was very friendly, and helpful but I did NOT appreciate both days I was here that by 3 pm my room was still not clean.  I have stayed in many hotels in Europe and never have cleaning staff taken so long to clean rooms.  After coming back exhausted from site seeing, the last thing I want to do is complain about a dirty room.    Other than that, the breakfast was good, and the area is in a perfect location filled with shops that is close to everything.  I'm glad I stayed here and would do so again."
3260,"We took two rooms here for 5 nights, as a family of four.  The rooms are pretty small but very nicely appointed, lots of polished bamboo.  Fair value.  The location in the heart of Eixample is excellent - we walked almost everywhere, or failing that, jumped on the nearby metro.  Lots to do nearby.  The hotel is nicely styled in a very contemporary way, it all seems quite new.  There is a rooftop pool bar (although bar service was a bit patchy up there). Very small, but nice to be up above the hustle and Re always seemed to be something going on in the lobby bar: DJ, live music, events.  There’s lot of room inside and out, including a nice courtyard to have breakfast or a drink.  The bar inside was a bit hit and miss - no drinks list, hard to know exactly what was available, and…"
3261,A great location with suitable amenities. Good service staff. Convenient laundrette services (payable) on-site. Walking distance to Cannes Main Train station. Will stay there again anytime. Highly recommend.
3262,Thankfully we only stayed one night in this hotel. We've received an 'upgrade' on our booking and were told that we'll get a room with ocean view. This would have been true if there wouldn't have been a huge palm tree in front of the window blocking the view. At first sight the room looks nice and modern. After a closer look we've noticed that the bathroom wasn't clean at all with hair on the floor and the sink. Also there was only one large towel provided. I expect at least two towels when booking a double room. The room itself wasn't very clean either and there were loads of small insects/bugs running around on the desk/side-table!! The mattress was very soft and we really sunk into the bed... The location is directly on Ocean Drive so you're in the middle of all the buzz if…
3263,Too much elevator noise and inattentive staff to a special problem…staff was rude instead of trying to solve a problem. Staff was aware of problem at check in and refused to take care of a long time customer.
3264,"Very nice hotel. Close to the city centre and cry clean and tidy. Staff were very professional, helpful and friendly. If I go again to France I would book the same hotel again. The rooms were very clean which is for me is the most important thing.              "
3265,"Really nice hotel close to the metro, shops, Moulin Rouge and Sacré-Coeur. Staff are super-friendly and helped us a lot (especially the woman with curly hair), and the room we got in the 6th floor was much better than we expected. The area felt super safe for two young ladies, and it was almost no noise. If you choose to live at this hotel, i recommend to eat pizza at La Serenissima which is 150m away from the hotel. Superb!!"
3266,"Ramada is located next to the airport making it a perfect place to stay overnight before an early flight the following morning. And that what it was also location-wise. Gluten free breakfast was then less perfect. Personnel didn't really know about the issue or didn't bother to assist either. Maybe the reason is the before mentioned thing that visitors are only spending the night before leaving there. Anyway, there's some fresh fruits and coffee, so you can survive until the take off hopefully. "
3267,"- Room size was not as advertised - Tub in the bathroom had rusted spots, drain in the tub also did not work very well and collected water as you shower - Bathroom door frame had lipstick smudge on it (which I cleaned myself) - Power outlets in the room were damaged (could barely keep a plug in) - Could hear people in the hallway as well as neighboring rooms (crying babies, TV noises, etc.) - Housekeeping did not come clean our room (we called Front Desk to make sure they would send someone.  They said they would and still no one showed up.)"
3269,"The staff gets an A+ as does the location and the breakfasts, the amazing showers could be the best in the world!!  The spa is mediocre and the rooms are TINY!  This is our second time staying there and we would return!"
3270,"central hotel, small, but everything you need available. Friendly staff, fresh made rooms, continental breakfast in the room or vegan downstairs in the cafe. It is just 2 minutes away from Opera, so very central. "
3271,"What a nightmare! This hotel is located in the number 1 WORST area in San Francisco, Tenderloin. Homeless drug addicts line the streets, screaming and shouting all the time. Nowhere during our booking were we made aware of how unsafe the area was, it was a last minute rush to find another booking. The hotel also confirmed that we were not the first people to have booked then cancelled and left within the first hour of being there. Stay well away from Tenderloin!"
3272,"In most places in Cannes it is awful to stay. Unfriendly, too warm or too cold, but not this place. It is one of the most decent places I've slept here and I have seen a few. Service is friendly, rooms are very clean, breakfast is good and prices reasonable. Good choice! "
3273,"1. Even if you have a gold membership card, there is no extra benefits in this hotel, I. E. welcome fruits, upgrade etc, which you can have in many other hotels. I checked in at night and try to ask for a welcome fruits, and the reception asked me to order from room service menu---cold service. 2. Even when restaurant is not crowded, waiter or waitress will forget to serve your tea or coffee  after asking!  From my personal observation, service to foreigners seems better and warmer than to Chinese, I.e. Sweet card in room, service in restaurant, etc, don't know whether this is in there training but feel so.  Just don't like it!"
3274,"This hotel had the worst customer service ever specially front desk and I'm very dissatisfied with it after paying $980. Very old furnished with a ugliness carpet, staff on front desk very unprofessional, it was never a good welcome on this place,the only thing was the view but for the price not worthy, this SF a city that should have a better hospitality"
3275,"I came to Saint Simeon Resort without any expectations.  It is a new and huge resort.  The villas are spacious and nice, but the quality made of the building workers are not professional. Much carelesses.  My biggest concern were the staff. Most of them showed no respect to me as a guest.  They were shouting to each other everywhere in the property even just outside of the villa I stayed in.  When I tried to get some quietness and peace at the swimmingpool 5 or 6 of the staff were standing there discussing some issues with very loud voices two days in a row.  It was extremely disturbing and difficult to understand.  At breakfast you normally get a friendly Good Morning when you stay in a 5 star resort, but when I came walking to the restaurant and the staff saw me coming they…"
3276,"Rooms are small. The street where it is located is very narrow and in the evening till dawn its crowded with people, drinking and partying. There is no elevator in second building so people having climbing problem will suffer. Breakfast is good. Staff is good. Location itself is good but the street is crowded after 5 PM "
3277,"Clearly a hotel sliding along the edge of cost efficiency.  Rooms were small - just big enough.  No masses of freebees in the bathroom.  Just a fluid soap with the unfortunate name of Body Hair.  Service was excellent, rooms were clean, breakfast enough, location very central."
3278,"Price somehow was 3x regular, but I got nothing. During 2nd night not all hygienic stuff was refilled.. parking is very small an tiny - I managed to damage my car. Food is good, reception works well, bet still - being priced 200€ per night U should expect something more than standard"
3280,"We had hundreds of dollars worth of personal items stolen at this hotel, potentially by persons employed by the hotel.  The response from the front desk manager was dismissive and deflective, the hotel took no responsibility, and even tried to distance themselves from dealing with the situation appropriately.   Friends of ours stayed there at the same time as us, and were given keys to a room that was already occupied, leaving us all feeling very insecure about the safety of our belongings whilst staying there.   All in all, thoroughly disgusted with the lack of security and the defensive nature of the inexperienced staff. I would not recommend, nor would I ever stay again.   Disrespectful and dishonest"
3281,"My family and I had a wedding this weekend. My sister and I shared a room hoping to have a good time only to find BEDBUGS! Not to mention, we had a 3 year old and a 3 month old in these beds. The only thing they did was offer a new room, with a broken TV. DISGUSTING! Do not recommend!"
3282,"Took the train from Valencia to Barcelona for a three day trip with my husband for my birthday. Interesting place to stay.  The decoration was modern and tasteful. Very comfortable room. On the day of my arrival I found a beautiful cake with fruit and a handwritten card wishing me a happy birthday and happy trip. Such a lovely thought and wonderful customer service! All the staff were incredibly helpful and friendly and the doormen always welcoming when we arrived and left. I think people need to understand that there is no restaurant here for anything other than breakfast, although it does boast a gym, small swimming pool and bars and as there are so many great places to eat nearby and an eastern themed room service menu (that is actually from a nearby take away restaurant). We…"
3284,"It is just before midnight and this hotel overbooked and did NOT have the decency  to have an alternate plan to house us for the evening. After 40 minutes, we are still awaiting a room nearby. We are Marriott premiere members, have been for two decades, and I cannot believe this. Never coming back"
3285,"located at a 5 min walk from freidichstarbe station, which though is not a main station , but has connecting trains to the main station.  many attractions and restaurants are walkable- 20 min,  memorial of jews and berlin wall, Rendenberg gate are at a walkable distance.  5 star hotel with all facilities. great decor and ambience and big rooms. free wifi. prohibitively expensive in house dining.  don't forget to go to Karl Shorsht world war II museum - amazing!!"
3287,"We came for a week in San Francisco with four children. We booked the hotel two months in advance and paid all the money in advance in order to ensure that we will have two rooms next to each other. When we checked in, it turned out that we have two rooms in the same floor but not next to each other which turned our stay into a nightmare. The lady at the reception did not care at all and was very rude. My husband and I had to sleep in separate rooms to ensure the safety of the children. On top of that, it seems like although we paid a lot of money for 2 suites we got the worst possible rooms below a balkony. They move the chairs there early in the morning and late at night. Now we cannot even sleep properly. On top of that, we received an email following our poor review on the…"
3288,"This is a former Embassy Suites hotel that has been converted to a time share operation for a lot more money for your stay. This is a nice property, but know this is a hotel property. We had a one-bedroom suite that is a lot smaller than other resort properties we own. It only has a partial kitchen (no stove/cook top). It is way over priced.  We stayed here through an RCI exchange of a two-bedroom ocean front property that has classy architecture and suite decor. We did this to experience Maui.  The biggest negative of this facillity is the time share sales operation which we found to be a lying, corrupt bunch of thieves. When we checked in we were directed to the concierge desk in the back. We were told of great tours and great discounts. We then went to an orienttion meeting…"
3289,"Everything but the gym is run down and tired.  Bathroom, carpets, drapes, things are broken, sheets are old and coarse.  Front desk checkin person was condescending.  Only nice thing about this place is the gym.  "
3290,It is a fair to question this description because due to its history - Berlin has very many centers. This is why it has so many and various Christmas markets. The rooms are to Holiday Inn European standard. Breakfast is again standard Euro fare. The Bar gets busy but not a touch on the other available options in Berlin. Cheaper food and drink items can be found at supermarkets across the road.
3291,"Hotel was clean, not great views from the bedroom. Bar does decent cocktails although you can wait sometime for them. Good breakfast and evening food was decent. About a 30 minute walk to central Lisbon but ample buses/trains close by. Spa was good value for money nice massage and private bath area"
3292,We booked via lastminute.com and was not sure what we would find...we were very pleasantly surprised. The manager had booked us two rooms next to each other for us and the kids and  were really helpful when it came to separating the king size bed for the kids so their could have a single bed each.  They catered for all our needs and made extra keys for each room so we could access both rooms if needed. We didn't eat breakfast as it was a bit expensive but there was a good supermarket nearby to buy food and drinks.  It was well located and always nice to come back to after a long day of sight seeing. We would come back here if we come back to Paris.
3293,We appreciated the extra room and the convenience of the nicely equipped kitchen of our studio. Staff here were great and the price offered excellent value. We enjoyed our stay and highly recommend this property.
3294,"First, the positives - the lobby is grandly beautiful.  Tall, arching ceilings with Art Deco reliefs are stunning.    The rest is crap - the rooms, the hallways and the service.  Also, the pool was non operational while I was there, so that didn’t help matters.   After I reserved my room online, I called to request a king and was told that shouldn’t be a problem.  However when I checked in, I was told that I had to upgrade for a king, at something like $100 a night above the steep price I was already paying.  I hate this type of bait and switch so I decided to stick with 2queens.  Unfortunately the room was terrible - It was dark and depressing, the sole window faced other rooms about 20 feet away, which meant I had to close the blinds and would receive zero natural light the…"
3295,"There are better locations, but this Hotel has a special flair. They also offered a nice price ! Fast check in with friendly service. Small room, but new renovated and very clean. My room was facing the backyard. I had dinner at the hotel, service ok and foot qualityy also. Sitting outside very nice. Nice bar a little noisy and it took a while that the staff recognized that there are customers in the room. I will return again.i"
3296,"I went to Berlin to run the marathon in September . This is one of the recommended place to stay according to the race organization. I highly recommend to stay there. The hotel is very clean, the room has a great size , service is great. Mercure is half block from subway station, 1km from the main train station and less than 2kms from Brandenburg Gate. The neighborhood is nice , with lots of options of restaurants."
3298,"We are so very glad that we stayed at this hotel. From the moment we entered we felt comfortable, it is very stylish, ultra clean and has a team of excellent staff, welcoming and with great Customer Service qualities, each and every one of them. We were greeted with a smile by Samson, who was very thorough at explaining all to us, so the check in process was seamless. Our room was just perfect. The bedding and beds were oh so very comfortable, clean and a superb bathroom, and great shower, all well stocked with a Nespresso, teas, and quality bathroom toiletries. It was quiet and we slept so well in the comfortable bed. The housekeeping staff kept the rooms immaculately clean.  The breakfasts are resplendent and the restaurant staff worked tirelessly to ensure that all the…"
3299,I always stay at Accor hotels. They have nailed down the value for money proposition. This hotel in particular is an aberration. The food is truly pathetic. They have Brazilian barbecue that serves basically road kill. The room service came with a basket of rolls that had been nuked in a microwave for a good 5 minutes; closer to hockey pucks than bread. This is the worst Novotel I have ever stayed at. 
3300,"My husband and 2 children (including a teenager) stayed in 2 conjoined rooms on the 3rd floor. It was a tight squeeze, but the rooms were so well designed, we and our luggage managed to fit. We even had enough room to hang laundry to dry. Meanwhile, my mother-in-law was in a single room down the hall. It was very spacious and had an impressive view of Rosenthaler Platz and the Berlin skyline. Despite being directly above busy streets, our rooms were quiet. Our beds were also extremely comfortable. The complimentary breakfast was delicious and healthy. There were artisan breads, cold cuts, yogurt, hardboiled eggs, cereals and plenty of fresh fruit. The staff were helpful and patient. Above all, the hotel's location was fantastic. The Rosenthaler Platz U-Bahn station and multiple…"
3301,"It's a very average hotel, slightly overpriced I'd say. Our room was clean and light. Pros: - Free wi-fi (works VERY slow in the room, but fast in the lobby) - Close to the main beach (15 min walk) - Close to a supermarket where you can buy drinks and some snacks or have a coffee - Very friendly and helpful staff Cons: - Our room was overlooking a noisy street which made it a bit difficult to fall asleep - An extremely basic breakfast for a 3* hotel. Breakfast time only till 10 am which is strange for a resort hotel. - Old beds, therefore very ""crunchy"" - Called one day ahead before check-in with a request to arrive at 12 pm. They confirmed, but upon arrival refused to allow check-in before 2 pm All in all, it was ok. The only reason I'd stay there again if there were no other…"
3302,"A bit outside centre of Cannes, but just a bit. Only 10 min walk to the Beach. Fantastic hotel, with spacious rooms, and balconies. Nice bar on the roof top. All the staff was very friendly. Like rooms with refrigirator, because you can stock up yourselves. Will definitly come back."
3303,"Stayed at this recently inaugurated hotel for the first time, and it still ""smelled new"" and was quite a hippy place- liked it, BUT the only downside is that the reception is clearly unmanned and a major bottleneck- i dont have thirty minutes to spare to check in (this is the time i queued to check in) nor to check put- please please hotel management- do think about rotating more employees to this function at peak hours, or otherwise you will very soon start wondering why you no longer have business guests checking in."
3304,"there were five of us in our party, 3 adults and 2 children. getting a red taxi from airport was easy, 15min drive, 7Lats, but beware being ripped off as we did on way back to airport, taxi drivers meter broke suddenly and he tried to charge us 14 Lats, we got away with 12 Lats but u should pay no more than 10, ask price first. we managed to get a twin and a triple room. rooms are quite spacious, beds were comfy but in our triple room there was no carpet. we stayed in the bit they are renovating at present so we had no private bathroom facilities. this wasnt a problem as there were shared facilities on the floor. i dont think hotel was full as we had no queueing for loo or shower and they were clean enough. there is a cafe on 2nd floor thats open til 6pm. it serves breakfast,…"
3305,"Let's try to describe it on topics... Front desk: I made my reservation through the Hoteis.com web site, as I do for all my hotel reservations, and by the first time I got problems in retrieving the reservation. Two ladies were attending the front desk, so I got one busy with my issues and the other was attending other guest. I do not know if it is the system or lack of personal training, but the one was with me was desperately trying to fix the reservation problem while a long line as being create on behind us. Took almost half hour to fix but all OK.  Appearance: Branding hotels have their names linked to certain quality, service, appearance, details that remember the hotel name and etc. So Meliã is a middle up level hotel and that is what you expect in all their hotels,…"
3306,"This apartment is conveniently located ( - we have family living in the next street), well equipped and reassuringly secure. There is a helpful concierge in the building during the day. We had only two minor complaints - firstly, the furniture is functional but a little sparse and secondly, in warm sunny weather it became uncomfortably warm during the day. That said, we shall stay here again when visiting Berlin."
3307,"Due to a large conference in SF, I booked at this hotel.  My first room smelt awful and I had to be moved. The walls of the 2nd room had peeling wallpaper, stained carpet, and chipped paint on the furniture.  The hotel appears to have been designed by Austin Powers after a bad night on crack!!  The area around the hotel has homeless transients in abundance.  I found this hotel has no redeeming features."
3308,"Recent stay: guys at the curb and bell hops were great. Front registration desk way understaffed, terrible attitude and rude.  Waited over 2 hours for room.  They never did text me as promised when room was ready. Several unanswered calls to front desk. I finally got back in line (3rd time). Didn’t get room reserved but they had worn me down by this time. Tried to resolve room issue easily with hide a bed.  Only for $40. Should have been compd  Will never return. Considering dropping my Hilton honors status - doesn’t mean anything any way.  Between work and pleasure I book 20-30 nights per year with Hilton - usually good experiences. Too bad this one horrible will cause  me to look elsewhere"
3309,"There’s a lot to like about the Hotel AlmaLusa tucked into a quiet corner of the Praca Municipio. The property is about two years old, and the staff was very pleasant and helpful. The location was convenient to restaurants and transportation to the main sites. We booked a standard room (a little over $300 US). It was very standard: no larger than any in this class and smaller than many: one chair. The biggest drawback was the lack of space to put our clothes and other travel items. There was no closet, just a single rather narrow shelf under the clothes rod (one of two – the other was on the other side of the comfortable bed.) For a four night stay, we were forced to work mostly out of our suitcases – which brings me to another problem: hotel stuff crowding out useable space.…"
3310,"This hotel looks nice downstairs but servive is not very good.  Breakfast is woeful, everyone walking around looking for plates, cutlery etc, tables not set, we are here for 5 nights, if it was not booked and paid for we would leave.  Had to ask at 5.15 today to have our room cleaned.  Locationg  good, our view is out on to other buildings, room very noisy. Probably worst hotel we have stayed in in South America."
3311,"I had a change of travel plans and called to cancel my (refundable, cancellable) reservation on a week day at 10:30 AM EST. I was told that I had to call back later in the day to cancel a reservation. I also tried calling the general reservation number and was told I had to call the hotel. Am a bit peeved that the hotel had very limited hours when they could help me with this extremely simple request."
3313,"We booked one night at this nh. Reception etc are nice and friendly.  Our room was in the so-called ‘boarding house’, an annex to the hotel. Try not to get a room in that part.  You have to go through the parking garage, across a construction site to enter that building. There is a direct entrance from the street, but key cards won’t open it (at least not at night).  The windows are directly towards a train line with s-bahns and ICE’s driving by just a few metres away... The room was big and modern.  The breakfast was delicious but quite expensive (25€)"
3314,"A beautiful hotel (in a not-great location). The good:  Beautiful room on a high room floor. Panorama Restaurant great view - wonderful food. Incredibly caring staff from the front office Manager, to the concierge to the bell staff.  Great housekeeping- spotless everywhere. The Bad:  Pool and spa nothing to write home about. Badly designed room bathroom with glass walls (no I am not kidding) and a slippery tub/shower.4 days without HOT water. Management tried very hard to fix the issue which did actually work for a few minutes. But we had 4 days of COLD WATER SHOWERS. Management did offer to change rooms but our schedule did not permit us the time to do so.  Had an elevator failure which caused us and several other guests to walk down 17 floors of fire escapes. The lobby…"
3315,"Before I left I read all the reviews and thought to myself it might not be the best  but at least it looks like they are trying and looks like they are taking steps to fix things that aren't great and this is exactly what I found....they are making it look like they are doing things but there is no attention to detail at all.  Firstly they say the rooms have been remodelled but this was done without doing a whole job (or at least in the room I was in).  Literally it looks like the room was painted but no preparation done at all under the new paint, the furniture is falling a part, the bottom was falling out of the drawers in the dresser, everything was old and worn out and there was no comfy chair in the room.  Also I think this is the only hotel in the world that doesn't have…"
3316,"When for 3 nights lovely hotel but it was a little to far out but that's not the hotels fault, staff very friendly and very helpful rooms nice size clean and tidy just what you want for a city break the tram runs outside regularly and once being on it once or twice you can get around easily."
3317,"The only thing nice about this hotel is the newly remodeled lobby.  Staff was rude.  Parking is a nightmare.  Breakfast was a joke.  Rooms were small.  Smells bad.  Bed uncomfortable.  My family stayed for 3 nights, and could not wait to leave."
3318,"I Landed upat the lalit for a night stay after a 17 hour work day. It's barely a km away from Mumbai international airport and had an afternoon flight. My office booked the hotel to beat the city's notorious traffic jams. I reached at 2 am fora check in. The huge spacious lobby was empty and dark. The front office person confirmed my booking and asked for my credit card to block the payment. I told him please check it's a corporate tie up booking and payment would be made on a billed to company basis. He said no.i showed him the booking confirmation. He said no way. I said check with sales office. He said done that, you have to provide card for blocking payment. I paid up over 13k rupees. And since it was a debit card payment the amount was instantly debited. He didn't Inform me…"
3320,The layout of this hotel reminds me a little of the Marriott by Heathrow if you’ve stayed there.  Good breakfast and the room was perfectly adequate. Standard kind of Marriott quality.  Good location very near Potzdamer train station.
3321,"Not really deserving of the 4 star rating.   Hotel staff helpful when asked but not forthcoming with information.  Bar area not staffed all the time and payment demanded in advance of drinks.   Mini bar and tea/coffee facilities in room poor or non existent. Little in the way of restuarants/bars nearby and a long walk up the hill from the centre to hotel. Breakfast is excellent. Overall ok if you don't mind basic, a walk into the centre and out all day. Wouldn't book again."
3323,"This ""resort"" is located in a beautiful location.  To call it a resort is stretching it though.  It's more like a dated Holiday Inn situated in a fantastic location.  Expect to get charged for everything, even parking.  In addition to the resort fee (which is already a ripoff), if you self park you will get charged $15 plus tax daily to park in the exact same lot that the abundant local riff raff are allowed to park in for free.  Speaking of the local riff raff, they are everywhere!  The trailer park trash takes over the pool regularly.  The clientele milling about the grounds is more similar to what you would expect if you were staying at a Motel 6 than at a ""resort"".  Property management needs to figure out how to keep the riff raff from ruining the experience for those that…"
3324,Nice free coffee with free chocolate croissants in the morning. Nice clean rooms but ask for a room in the back as it can be very loud at the front. My colleague had a room in the front and switched after 2 days because he couldn't sleep well. WIFI is good in every room!
3326,"I had high hopes for this place.  After having been to the Skye Bar in the past, I was excited for the opportunity to see the rest of the hotel.  Wow - yeah, not so much!  Beyond the location of the hotel (was always within 10-15 minutes of any meeting I had during my stay) I really struggle to come up with anything positive to write in my review.   The first thing you'll notice is the price.  It is an expensive hotel.  This can be OK, even warranted, based on length of stay and the time you may need to get around town for meetings or whatever - I get that location can play a large role in this.  Having said this, I am happy to pay a high fee but with that, I would hope to get a higher level of service and amenities:  Room - average.  The rooms are quite small for what you get…"
3327,"The hotel was in good condition rooms are clean and staff are friendly.  However, the rooms are very tight and small beyond 2 people.  A cot for my daughter was placed in the only available walking space in the room which meant we had to climb over beds to get to the bathroom and door.  The breakfast was good and plentiful.  But the staff was unable to keep up with the number of guests during the peak hours, many dishes empty with 10-15min wait for replenishing.  The hotel itself is 5min from the Campo Pequeno bull fighting arena and metro station-which is not near the city center.  It takes about 30min to get to the city center by metro because you have to make a few connections.  Plus the intervals between trains can also lengthen the time.  If your purpose is for leisure and…"
3328,"Check in was bad! Came to Hotel at 1:30 a.m. and not given a room till 3:00 p.,.. Elevator was broken-long wait to get to floor. Parking was advertised as free on web-site--$49.00 @ day. Getting out of parking lot was terrible-broken with very little assistance. I would never stay at your hotel again and I would not recommend to anyone."
3329,"A good hotel that need some improvement, the pictures on the website look nothing like the real room we were in ! The bed need to be changed.  Check in was fast, room was cleaned everyday and the breakfast is served late on weekends which is good.  The hotel have to change their breakfast menu doesn’t include any sort of protein for non-pork eaters excluding eggs which almost all the time were finished either you come at 8 or 9 or 10 am. I found my self eating toasted bread with honey or cheese (when i can find). The fresh fruit had dark spots (to improve).  Hope the hotel will make improvement."
3331,"Stayed in the hotel for 3 weeks!!!  The room was comfy but the air conditioning was weak n the room Got too hot...  Breakfast was great but they didn’t diversify it even once...  The gym is ok, they could invest more n get a bench press/squat cage in there....  "
3332,"Stayed at Marriot Marquis and nearby Westin Gaslamp on a recent business trip. Recommend the Westin by far. Friendlier, customer oriented, better amenities in the rooms, free wifi and closer to the restaurants and bars in the Gaslamp. Marriot Marquis was meh and unfriendly...plus $12 for wifi in an already expensive room..."
3333,"Hotel residents should be careful not to touch the 1-liter bottle of water placed on the front desk in the room.  If you accidentally drink the water without reading the label, the price is TEN times of market value.  This is called ""business trick"" often found in 2-3 star hotels, seldom in 4 star hotels.  When the front desk receptionist told me my due included the water which was ten times of market value, I knew I was caught by their ""business trick"" and the rank and reputation of this 5 star hotel was reduced by itself."
3334,"After reading encouraging reviews of this older and off site hotel rated top in SF felt compelled to give it a try on our latest visit to SF. And what a shock we were hit with. Prices were comparable to 5 star hotels in  the city to be expected of #1 rating. Rooms were small with average 3 star amenities, bathroom, closet, heating system, etc. No view whatsoever on deluxe room. Upon request of room with partial view advised it would be extra 75 which would bring over rate of Four Seasons or Ritz Carlton and this is not remotely close in any respect to either one. The staff was stubborn and inflexible.  Even 4 star hotels are superior for half the price. So why #1? Probably its a nostalgia issue but clearly we were looking for confort, convenience,  amenities,  service and we…"
3336,"We were told at check in, we could not park at the hotel parking lot because it was full. There was a sign in the parking lot advertising parking spaces to lease with a monthly rate. I am assuming people live here in addition to hotel guests? Anyway, we had to drive six blocks to a parking garage. Only two towels in the bathroom every day, there were 4 of us. On a positive note, beds were comfy, room clean, outdoor pool nice and warm, breakfast staff friendly and great location."
3337,"We spent two nights in this ""hotel""... The only thing that they have nice is the lounge bar and the restaurant, where they were so nice so let us eat at 11 PM, when every place to have dinner in SF was closed! Beside this, i really want to complain about this ""hotel"". First of all it looks like a motel. The staff could also be nice, but the rooms are so old! The bathroom looks like you are in 40's, the sink was clogged. The second night that we were there, we couldn't turn on the lights. Only the light in the bathroom was working. The room of our friends was not cleaned, maybe because they forgot to do it...  It's close to the city hall, and that's it.  When we were checking off, they let us wait for half an hour because they had problems with some customers credit cards.  Never…"
3338,"This was the most comfortable stay of the Hotels I visited on a 7 day trip to the UK and Germany, there was a good bar and very nice sheets and comforter as well as a good breakfast. All the hotels were similarly priced."
3339,The accommodation rate per night is ok and acceptable for my budget. The hotel is provided soft drink under silver Accor club with pre-village beer. The hotel can be access by public bus better than metro or underground. 
3340,"I needed, and was supposedly given, an ""accessible"" room, and the only part that qualified was the shower.  There was no bar by the toilet.  My stay was for 5 nights, and I brought this problem to the attention of the front desk and the service staff immediately, but nothing was done.  The ice machine was also at the other end of the hotel and entailed an unacceptable walk for a disabled individual."
3341,"After a cancelled and then delayed flight I arrived at the hotel just ready to go to sleep before a day of meetings nearby.   However I was unsympathetically informed that they had given my room away despite my confirmed booking.    I was then directed to a lower grade hotel far across town.   Not once did the two folks at the desk apologize for the inconvenience.   But they did say that if i could interrupt my day of meetings tomorrow and get over to the hotel early enough all the while lugging around my stuff they might be able to honor the second night of my ""confirmed"" reservation.   Unbelievable."
3342,"The hotel is modern, clean and conveniently located close to the metro and shopping districts. Our room was spacious and quite, and the free Wi-Fi worked well. A full breakfast is offered at a reasonable price. Overall good value for money."
3343,Stayed here in mid November. Best bathroom in 4 weeks. The location was fine being close to multiple metro stations and buses. It felt like Nothing was more than 15-20 mins away. The room was excellent. The bathroom was spacious with a large bath which pleased my partner greatly. The checkin was quick and seamless. The only thing thing was the free wifi was one of the slowest we have had but there was an option to pay for high speed. The young man at the counter was particularly helpful when I needed to get some documents printed. There was a dining room offering breakfast however we never used it. There is eating options close by. We were more than happy with our choice for our three day stay. Recommend. 
3344,Came to Berlin last minute with some friends and decided to stay at this hostel. Since we were 3 of us decided to get the triple room. Checking in with Laura was a pleasure. She made us feel welcome and appreciate this place a lot by telling us all the amenities and services it has to offer. The hotel was really clean. We didn’t have a lot of time to enjoy all the amenities but we enjoy staying here and how the staff treated us.
3345,"A nice hotel, reminding of student life the way its designed.good lobby to sit and relax and the executive room is really nice and spacious. It s s bit far from the city centre but you can reach it so easily with m50 and m51 metro lines or the number 13 with tram!"
3346,"This was my first stay at this property, but not my first stay with IHG. I've enjoyed my stays at this hotel so much that I pay for Ambassador membership.  This was, however, my most disappointing stay at an IHG.  On the first night, I called the desk to inquire how much beverages in the fridge would cost to purchase. I was told rather curtly that it was on the menu with the fridge. When I explained the menu wasn't there, and I just wanted a price, I was told it was there, and I should look for it, followed by being hung up on.  Before going to bed, I noticed the bed had been made, but not replaced from the previous guest. The pillows in particular were very wrinkled, had traces of black hair on them (I'm a ginger), and the sheets smelled faintly of perfume. At 23:30pm, I took…"
3348,"This hotel in theory caters to business travelers. In reality, it really has a long way to go. Wi-fi is spotty at best of times, so getting work done is a struggle. Linen and towels are old, thin, and mediocre quality. Housekeeping tends to forget to clean the room's bathroom. Front desk's default answer is not available. Need an umbrella? Not available. An adapter? Not available. Help with a reservation? Good luck. Location is great, walking distance to most offices (however, with no available umbrellas in the rainy season, you'll arrive soaked), but this is not a major plus as many there are many hotels available in the area. Breakfast is convenient and decent but nothing to write home about. Generally speaking, there are better options."
3349,Not really part of the Marriott and it's not worth the money to stay in a super noisy room. If the lounge is not free access to members with status then why would you advertise it as is then tell the guests at checking in then it's not part of the Marriott?
3350,"Let us at least start with the positives.  For devotees of Art Deco ( my wife and I arrived at the hotel following a weekend at the Art Deco festival in Napier New Zealand ) this building is magnificent and even the new wings to the original hotel have been designed in the same style and attention to detail.  As is the norm in IndoChina the staff were pleasant, attentive and the level of service was excellent. BUT.  Despite booking a superior room with river view it most certainly was not superior and the river view was possible only if one leaned over the balcony and even the river was distant and obscured by trees. But far worse was the bathroom which was minute and with a shower which was virtually unusable.  I suspect that even Accor's Formula 1 chain of ""hotels"" are better…"
3351,"Stayed here for 3 nights on a city break. Very easy to get to from airport, S Bahn station and tram stop right next to hotel, the tram is excellent and takes you all around the city.  The hotel restaurant, Mavericks, is good with a small but tasty menu, and the Skybar on the top floor is well worth a visit, stunning views over the city and great drinks menu, spent every night in there.  Our room was spacious and comfortable with large walk-in shower and no street noise.  The hotel Spa is also good, but it is a naked spa! So no clothes are allowed in the sauna or jacuzzi, wee bit strange at first but once you’re in it’s ok!  Buffet breakfast is good all fresh and tasty with freshly made omelettes.   Great hotel all round and would def stay again. "
3352,Unethical with sneaky urban fees $30/night that doesn’t match original reservation total.There was no breakdown for the mysterious “ urban fee’ until the charged on your credit card. Charges should be up front so everyone knows what they get. Unethical!
3354,"We stayed at the hotel for one evening prior to taking the train from Gare Montparnasse to Bretagne. It is relatively easy to get to by Metro and it is a 5 minute walk to the train station, so the location is perfect. The rooms were a good size and we were grateful that the air conditioning worked great as it has been incredibly hot in France this summer. I booked quite early and got what I thought was a good rate for Paris.The room rate included a glass of champagne. I requested a quiet room on an upper floor and found the room to be quiet, comfortable and cool, with nice bathroom amenities. I have recommended the hotel to friends already and would return again."
3355,"Nice hotel, good location, very easy to get from/to Tegel Airport. Good breakfast, you can rent a bike from there and also park it in front of the hotel, you have a supermarket downstairs in case you need something. It's not close to Berlin's popular attraction, but we found it easy to connect with other parts of the city. You can walk, take the underground or buses quite easily."
3356,"Staff is great, Redwood Room is great.  Rooms are old and outdated, carpet doesn't seem clean, windows so dirty could almost not see out of them.  Walls so thin can hear the people in the next room and they were not being overly noisy.  They were just talking and laughing normally."
3357,"Check in was easy and there were no issues. However, it went downhill from there. The towels were stained and the floors were sticky. When it came time to go to sleep you could hear every single thing going on outside. This includes the cars driving by and honking, as well as the homeless yelling at each other. Also, the window was broken so you could not lock it. Another issue was the air conditioning. It sounded like a broken coffee machine/static tv all through the night. When I went down to talk to someone the next morning they said maintenance would come and fix it. That night I had the same issue again. I went back downstairs to ask if maintenance ever came and the person at the front desk said the previous person lied to me and maintenance doesn’t come until the next day.…"
3358,"Extraordinarily friendly, courteous service wrapped up in a great location and well-maintained, beautiful property.  I recommend 9Hotel Opera without reservation (pun intended!) -- especially if pleasure or business takes you to Gare De L'Est district."
3360,I stayed 2 nights to attend the IFA fairground off Messedamm. I've used this hotel before and found that it is still very good.  Changes since my last visit one year ago: Not much really.  Marcus is still on reception and is a very good member of staff.  Thank you Marcus!  The breakfast room is nothing special but adequate. Note that only breakfast is catered for at a supplement of €14 and there is no lunch or dinner service.  I noted that you can now buy sandwiches at reception.  The room I stayed in (427) was clean and comfortable with no maintenance issues.  A keypad entry safe is provided free of charge that you can just about get a laptop PC in if you slant it at an angle. The staff are all very accommodating. The free WiFi worked well - sign-on required. There is no…
3361,"The hotel is a modern style hotel just minutes from shopping and restaurants.  Staff are friendly and helpful.  Rooms vary in size.  Elevators are a bit small, but stairs are easily accessible.  Breakfast has lots of options.  They have the squeeze bottles in the bathroom, so bring your own shampoo, conditioner, etc.  The hotel is about a 15 minute walk from Museum Island and a little further to the Reichstag and Brandenburg Gate."
3363,"The Hotel located in the center of Berlin ,  designed by the famous Arts of Andy Whorel  Giving you a great feeling of Modern design but in the same time a cozy feeling . The breakfast not so recommended ,   it offers quite small and simple assortment .  Ps  the cleaning services for special requests working slowly (4 hours)!!!"
3364,"The hotel unfortunately did not live up to the brand reputation.  We stayed for five nights in total (across two stays) and the disappointment started each time with the arrival. We came late at night with our baby daughter and on both occasions none of the bellboys (and there were quite a few) thought it relevant to help us. At front desk the English skills were very poor and no sense of urgency given we arrived late at night and simply wanted to quickly go to the room.   On our first stay at least the room was nice - but on the second one it was very small and once we set up our small travel cot, the room was full. We mentioned this to front desk and we're being told we had already received an upgrade. I really don't want to know, how small the standard room can possibly be!  …"
3365,"This hotel is only few seconds from Oragienstrasse where you find numerous bars and clubs with the most famous one probably being SO39. The hotel is clean, the staff are friendly, the WIFI is very good at all times and even tho my room is facing Prinzenstrasse's busy road the level of noise is very low and, so far, I got two good nights sleep here.  What I like about motel one group is that the rate mostly remains the same and it doesn't go dramatically up and down based on the market. I also like the fact that you can always cancel your booking before 12PM with no penally. This is a great advantage.   My only concern about this place is the mattress and the pillows; they are not comfortable, they are not horrible either, but I think they could have done much better with the…"
3366,"Stayed for a few night's in December, good hotel in a good location easy to get metro and buses and can walk to quite a few of the main sights. Hotel clean rooms different but in a good way, coffee available 24 hours, we didn't have breakfast bought something nearby. Would stay here again. "
3367,Clean and good location. Easy to explore Berlin with the appartment as base camp. Both Berlin Zoo (fantastic aquarium by the way) and shopping malls are within walking distance. The S Bahn takes you all over the city. 
3368,"I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. The rooms are cramped, extremely dirty and downright unpleasant. They look NOTHING like the photos. (I'm not one to use all-caps willy nilly...in this case, it is warranted.) No nice bedding, no throw pillows, no fresh coat of paint. I'm sure the photos don't include the crumbs all over the carpet. The tiny window in the room is reminiscent of a jail cell. Tiny and so high up you can't eve see out.   I wish I had taken photos to show how bad it all was.   Don't let the glitzy lobby fool you - there is nothing upscale about this place. For the price, this hotel is a rip off.   The only pro about this hotel is the location. Less than a block off Michigan Ave."
3369,"We usually rent a house when we stay in any of the Hawaiian islands. However, this time we decided to stay at The Marriott. Our expectations are usually based on the price tag, we hope it matches the location, resort and the Staff.  I'll begin with the negatives:  If you have kids, I noticed they will bunch you up near other rooms with kids, so you don't disturb other guest! Makes sense... Unless you end up in the rooms near the lounging area or early check in area on the second floor directly over the managers desk. Basically, this means a door will slam every time someone uses the restroom, lounge or small ""library"" they have. Its a high traffic area, noisy. We asked to be moved, and got the typical...""We are all magically booked"" Bad start...  To eat at the premises it is…"
3370,This is a lovely old hotel that has easy access to the central town region and to the trains. We could have easily spent more time there and will come back one day soon. We loved all the Christmas markets in the city too!
3371,Lovely hotel. Nice facilities and well located. We had a weekend break 15 16 feb and the hotel was a perfect base to explore Barcellona and return to a calm comfortable place. There is a lovely roof terrace which in summer will be fab to relax with drinks. Rooms are comfortable modern and well arranged. Aĺl in all a nice option to consider when visiting Barcellona
3372,"Booked the hotel for 3 nights based on good reviews here. When we came the electricity did not work, the room was hot but after some back and forth it was ok. However the room was dirty and the phone broken.  Some staff were great but other kept nagging us to sell guided tours, private cars and other services. It was akward to keep saying no and they even got rude.  The lights were out in the hallways and one time the staff for breakfast serving did not show up until 15 min after breakfast servive opened.  Can not recommend this hotel based on our experience."
3373,"I booked a private room, 2 nights.  On the 2nd night I was woken by 2 strangers--2 men--entering my room: they'd been given keys by the front desk.  Frightened and half-naked, I had to fight and push them to get them out, but they continued trying to get into the room w. their keys.  After this assault and serious security breach, I immediately called both the front desk & Expedia; I couldn't sleep the rest of the night and left in the early morning.  Now, almost 72 hrs after the incident, I have received no communication from either CGH or Expedia: no apology, no refund or compensation, nothing.  A very disturbing experience: cannot recommend to those who value their safety."
3374,Very nice hotel in a very good location very close to the Check Point Charlie and within walking distance of the other main landmark. Unfortunate in my stay teh air conditoning in the rooms were not working.
3375,"One positive...staff on reception very friendly and helpful. Major renovation works being done to improve the reception and looks dreadful.  Tried to use the stairs and could not get into reception as they had locked the door! Told the staff my concerns if there was a fire, still didn't sort this.  Whole hotel is dated, run down and in need of a major facelift. Area is good, opposite Grant park and near the museums. The restaurant next to the hotel does great food for breakfast at food prices, but this hotel is not of the usual Best Western standard by any level"
3376,"I would really like to give a 4, but there are too many kinks to do so.   First, the positives:   The hotel is in a very good location, right near a metro station and a mall and not very far from the old part. A lot of stuff is within walking distance. The room is a very good size and very well-laid out. In addition, they have double doors, which is very smart, to block noise from the hall.   The room also had a terrace with a sort of garden and great views of the old part of town and partial sea views. The room was generally quiet.  The issues are the following:  My WiFi was terrible throughout my stay and there was nothing they could do to fix it. They said that this was a rarity, but they couldn't find the problem, chalking it possibly up to construction. This forced me to…"
3377,This hotel did not live up to the expectations nor the pictures on the website.  The hotel is very tired and rooms very dated with the F&B being extremely average.  The check in and check out process was painful and the hotel allowed twice random people charging food bills to my room and making me responsible to pay them as until today I have not seen or heard back from them
3378,"Excellent design for small hotel.  Good size bathrooms, walk in shower. Wonderful breakfast and great coffee of your choice.  Friendly staff and good location near metro but out of the high tourist area."
3379,"Checked in for a two night stay,  Assigned a very tiny room (301) which was too small in which to swing a cat.  Arrived late, so didn't make a fuss and accepted it.  Room was stuffy, so turned on the a/c, making sure all set properly.  When I came back from dinner the room still was a lot hotter and stuffier than the corridor.  Front desk staff did not seem surprised. I was moved to a better room: higher up, larger, and with a working air conditioner.  Today, I was out from 8:00 a.m to 2:00 p.m.  On my return the room had not been made up.  The location is good but not great for sightseeing in Porto.  Breakfast is an average Portuguese hotel buffet: good but neither bad nor especially great.  Staff pleasant enough."
3380,"This hotel is in an excellent location to explore Amsterdam, walking distance of grand central station, we had a 9th floor bedroom,  wonderful view, but we booked on a discount site, we would not pay the full rate, room was showing signs of wear and tear,  no dressing robes, coffee machine but no instructions so didn't use, we were relaxing in the bar.... a group of business colleagues were in there, they actually ordered around 10 takeaway pizzas, smelly and messy, just not what you would expect in a hotel of this callibre, not bad but not worth the full room rate!"
3381,"Lovely hotel with a central location near almost everything. Very cosy and just the right touch of affordable luxury.  The room service though is very slow and it took an hour to get the room service menu! The manager (deborah i think) made it up to me and offered dinner free of charge :)  The concierge Sebastian was an absolute pleasure to deal with. As I was only in berlin for a couple of days, he helped me navigate the city and plan my days so I wouldn’t miss any of the important land marks.   Really good hotel overall."
3382,"DO NOT stay here. If you're lured here by the beautiful lobby, stay elsewhere and stroll through the charming lobby as that is where the charm ends. I am a Hilton Honors member, and I purchased a ""Business Plus"" package through the Hilton app that was described simply as including ""a daily food and drink credit with prem wifi and more."" I couldn't find any additional information on this package online on the hotel website or on the app so I asked for details about it when I checked in. The woman at the front desk said that I had a $25 food and drink credit that could be used anywhere in the hotel, including the mini bar in the room, but it did not include room service. I was never provided a description in writing and took the woman at the check-in desk for her word regarding…"
3383,+nice hotel  +clean  +can open the window  +nice bathroom  +love the signature song  - the Woman at the front office  who did our check out is not proficient ( it’s took her almost 20 min to check us out and her apology is very superficial ) other than that we had a great week in Berlin and in Sofitel...
3384,"Everything was awesome! Very comfortable and cozy room, with a very useful kitchen, excellent bed, very good wardrobe and cleaned bathroom. Everything is well placed in the room. The services are well done and Julian was very helpful when I needed. The local area is very good too. I highly recommend Smartments for any type of trip you're doing in Berlin. They will always look forward to help you out."
3385,"I booked this hotel for my husband’s birthday and cannot recommend enough. The service was impeccable and all of the hotel staff were so accommodating with all of our requests. They allowed us early check-in, late check-out, gave us a room upgrade and even sent a surprise birthday cake - made our stay so memorable and cannot thank the staff enough, especially Marion and Paul on the front desk!"
3387,"We have just stayed in Hotel Rec for the Barcelona Half Marathon and loved it! The hotel is next to the Arc de Triomf and very easy to find from the metro stop. All the staff were very friendly and welcoming, we even had a special half marathon pack provided in our room!  We booked the Rev Quiet room which was a lot bigger than I thought it would be and perfect for a couple. The Bluetooth speakers in the room is a fab feature! The rooftop lounge is great and relaxing and is definitely a sun trap even in February.  I would definitely recommend and stay here again :)"
3388,"Checkin: there is a clear line to check-in for rewards members (large sign, welcome mat). Nothing for non-rewards members. Very confusing as to where to go. If they want to make you feel like a second class citizen upon entrance: mission accomplished! Also, the citrus air freshener they blitzkrieg the lobby with is assaulting on the nose. Similarly, the hallways smell very weird, like chemical cleaning agents and burnt hair. The ceiling are all really low and make the hallways and rooms feel cramped.   Room itself was pretty small, including tiny bathroom and crappy little shower. 'Luxury'? I have honestly stayed in far nicer rooms at Best Western.   The service? Jeez. I booked a second night because we had a wedding and didn't want to move hotels. Plus, it appeared to be the…"
3389,"Great location, friendly and professional staff, decent food however no worth the price. Internet SUCKED! Staff could not fix WiFi which made doing on line business impossible. That alone would be reason NOT at this hotel."
3390,"Excellent attention from the greeter/concierge! We arrived in Barcelona before our check-in time and didn't want to waste any time for sight seeing. We were greeted at the door and were able to fill out all the needed paperwork and given a key. They stored and then moved our luggage into our units so we could hit the streets! We returned to clean and quiet rooms, one with a balcony for a quiet after dinner drink :)"
3391,"Room amenities is quite old but well maintained. Pool small but clean and staff at the pool is helpful and friendly. But the ones at reception desk destroyed all. First, I asked for a band-aid, and they said no immediately. OMG, even a hostel got an emergency kit, but at this ""4-stars"" hotel, they have none. It's absolutely unacceptable. And in the evening, when I walked through hotel's doors, a young receptionist came to me and asked me about my room number, then she spoke quite loudly with her colleague, ""Who took room 210?"" in Vietnamese. It's very impolite from them, when asking me then talked with each other that loud about my room and me, and left me no explanation of their intent. They were unprofessional and very rude."
3392,"Great location near cathedral   New hotel - all rooms good , junior suites good value for size   Roof top terrace great views albiet simple food menu  Great breakfast selection included in bed and breakfast.  Suite 604 recommended superior room 612"
3393,"We have wanted to go this hotel for a number of years and were very disappointed. Parts of the hotel need to be refurbished and also the rooms need to be updated in various areas of the hotel.However the food is excellent and the staff are very helpful at all times. We did decide to have afternoon tea on the terrace which was very nice. Tip avoid booking on a Friday as lots of outside parties arrive for tea and the service is slow. The pool area is first class and and no problem with sun beds plenty for everyone. i maybe think it is living off past reputation, and updating is required. I have stayed in much better 5 star hotels in the world."
3394,"If you are traveling alone or with your partner and are looking for a nice affordable room in the Paris' Le Marais district this is the place to stay.  The room I stayed in was small, but nicely layed-out - but I was traveling alone, and there may be larger accommodations.  The friendly staff made the stay even more enjoyable."
3395,"Just booked our 4 night stay at Radisson Blu Aqua but after reading the reviews about the 20/Night Urban Fee, I am having second thoughts.  Pretty deceiving for it not be clearly listed on booking.com.  I spoke to Booking.com and they said it is the Radisson's responsibility to list this but when I spoke to Radisson they said they had no control over what is listed.  Pretty disappointing."
3397,"It's a bad  place. Wrost promoters for pre-party in all miami. They promise a lot of thing they give no satisfaction. The promoter tried to flirt with me, he was very insistant. Very bad experience with the Clifton hotel."
3398,"Celebrated our 20th wedding anniversary here. Beautiful little hotel. 3 star but felt like 5 star.  Everything was spotlessly clean. Not a massive room but enough for what we needed. We had a family room which was 2 connecting rooms.  Double glazing so slept like a baby, not a single sound to be heard.  Very funky little hotel, with great design.  Great to have free drinks in the mini bar and free croissants, coffee and tea etc in the foyer all afternoon.  Breakfast is not massive but still plenty of choice.  Staff super friendly. Big shout out to Hassan on reception. A big asset to the hotel.  Would stay again and will recommend to anyone traveling to Paris"
3399,"We selected the Novotel Mitte for its location, very convenient to many top sights to see. The staff was always very helpful, the room was very clean. Our room had a very large handicap accessible bathroom (I don’t know if all the rooms are so equipped) so our main room size was a bit small and tight as a consequence. However, the room was comfortable and the temperature control worked extremely well. The breakfast buffet was extraordinary; more options and selection than I can name. Overall, a very good choice and value,"
3400,"rooms very nicely appointed, if a little small. the junior suites are worth the extra money. service uniformly excellent - at reception, in the restaurant, and especially the outstandingly helpful concierge. an excellent restaurant. a very good location too."
3401,"Stayed here with 5 friends for a weekend away. It was 6 guys in total and the hostel catered for our needs perfectly.  It was close to a station/Alexanderplatz and was a bed for the night! All beds have individual plug sockets which is handy for charging phones overnight. Also the shower was actually pretty decent for a hostel.  The beds weren't particularly that comfortable, not sure what the material was on the mattress but felt like it was constantly damp. So sleep quality wasn't the greatest but other than that, very good!"
3402,"Pros Very nice hotel, close to many points of interest. Terrific breakfast buffet.  Cons  A/C very inadequate in rooms. Never got below 72.5 - 73. Makes for hot sticky nights. Reception made excuses that because of technical problems the display was wrong. But my sweating said the display was correct. Not acceptable at the price charged. "
3403,My hotel room had blood stains on the bed sheets and the towels. In addition they do not have an electric station for electric vehicles. I contacted the hotel prior to my reservation and they informed me they do have an electrical charging parking. Sure I arrive and they have no clue what I am speaking about. This hotel should not even exist. Do NOT EVER BOOK it even if it is for free. By the way my hotel room was $348 and is equivalent to a nice room at the Fairmont hotel
3404,"Terrible, worst hotel I've ever stayed in. Although this is the second time I have come here, the staff attitude is not friendly, look at the guest appearance, because I dress simple or because my age is young so they are treated so badly. When I checked in, they did not even serve the welcome drink for me and my mother. Because the name of the room was just my name, they told me not to let my mother check in with me. She said that after looking at my ID and knowing she was younger than her, she immediately changed her attitude. She hit the paper on the table and told me the list was just my name so she did not allow my mother to take a room with a very bad attitude. I did not see her name, and of course, the receptionist would not be able to provide me with that information.…"
3405,"ok.  This is a third world country and it was carnival but honestly everything is on half speed.  The public areas are ok, the swimming pool people are delightful, the dry martini bar is cool.thats the good news.  The elevators have been installed by madmen, the junior concierge Gabriel could do with a ten year visit to charm school, The bathroom in my junior suite was disgusting, the rooms seem to be serviced in the late evening, and the corridors reminded me of Eastern Europe c 1980 dank and dark..the fact that most of the guests are airline crew tells you something.  It's cheap.  But not to suckers like us.  Avoid.  It's not the worst but I assume it's not the best.  "
3406,"This is the third time to this Novotel in Paris , I love the location, the service , the clean rooms and the ambience at the hotel . This time it was better that usual. I have my flights 7:30 pm on today Sunday . I need to have a late check out . I asked the desk person to extend my check out and I was willing to pay more to star in the room until 4 pm. The front desk agent told me that in Sundays they have two late check outs one at 3 pm and other at 5 pm .  I couldn’t believe it!! I was so please and Happy , I have the chance to walk the city one more time with my family, I have two rooms and enjoy the last few our in Paris ! I also noticed the breakfast crew working so hard to accommodate everyone in the morning , we can make our own eggs any way we wish ,  I Love the family…"
3407,"This hotel is quite lovely looking, they have all the right finishing's to qualify for a 4 star ...no debate.  The problems we had (2 day stay ending tomorrow) reflect the service in a few key areas.    It's quite difficult to get someone to answer the phone (from your room at the front desk) - it just rings and rings (you will see it when you are at the front desk - they just don't answer it or when you try to dial you get a busy signal), and generally when you do what you request isn't followed up on (for us it was a broken toilet that we called a few times about and nobody came).  There is no concierge - so you just wait in line to ask a question (cause they generally don't answer the phone - as the front desk seems a bit understaffed).   We couldn't get laundry service or…"
3408,"When we arrived they had no record of our booking despite us having a confirmation email. Because of our age we were threatened that we would get kicked out, and we spent the rest of our night with anxiety and couldn't wait to get the hell out of there to go and have some fun."
3409,"Just returned from here today we found the apartments clean ,the beds were comfy and the staff helpful the down side and the only reason we wouldn't return is the lack of air conditioning which is a shame as the view of the beach is lovely and the pool was clean the sun beds comfortable and it was peaceful loved lagos and will be back"
3410,after a 12 hours flight with our kids we waited with other hotelguests at the airport for the free transfer. the sign at the curbside says that a bus is leaving the hotel every 20 minutes to bring and collect guests. after 40 minutes a brasilian guest called the hotel regarding the transfer. 10 minutes later - still no bus did arrive - we took a taxi to the hotel (2 minutes drive). after a while the other guests arrived with the hotelbus. the receptionist was very unfriendly and it took her 30 (!!) minutes to check us in. all the guests arriving with the bus had to queue for even longer time to be served. totally inefficient and unprofessional. at least the rooms are ok for a short night due to the long waiting times. the transfer from the hotel to the airport went smooth.
3411,"Our room was excellent. It was so quiet despite being near the city hub. The rooms were also lovely and dark at night - great for a sleep in.  The bathroom was large and, like the rest f the rom, modern and clean. We had a thoroughly enjoyable stay.  The only downside was the dodgy Internet. "
3412,"Despite making the reservation with Aloft, we arrived to find the hotel had been changed to a Gates/ Hilton hotel. As there was no Aloft signage anymore we drove around for 20 mins trying to find the place. An email from the hotel would have been helpful to tell us that the name of the hotel had changed?  For some reason they close all the bars from 3pm to 5pm to ""prepare for dinner"", whatever that means.   Checkout was a disaster. I needed the bill split onto two credit cards as the trip was part business/ part leisure. Their system couldn't handle such complexity and the entire bill ended up on one card. When I called to have it rectified they said the system cannot make any changes to a closed bill. I think they need some new systems..."
3413,Stay away from this hotel It is overpriced and the staff is not helpful. We survived a very bad stay and would not go back if it were free. The air conditioner did not work properly the entire trip. The room was freezing or if we turned it off hot and stuffy. The staff made little attempt to fix the problem and then just shrugged it off. We stayed only because there were no other rooms nearby available
3415,"Not what I'd consider a 4 star hotel & certainly not for a holiday. Good for a conference perhaps.  Mini bar in room, but no kettle or tea/coffee.  Small rooms & basic amenities.  When we appealed for a larger space as we were there for 7 nights, we were told in no uncertain terms by an unfriendly manager that it was available at the going rate, no less. That kind of ruined the beginning of my birthday (a 4 star hotel would pick up on stuff like that).  The gym & spa are just enough for a couple of guests at a time, no more.  No prices supplied on the in-room spa treatment list.  Room service possibly the worst I've ever encountered.  First night arrived tired & got a sandwich steak cut in half thrown in a bun with no dressing, salad or condiments & a plate of not-crispy crisps.…"
3416,Nice location. 2 minute walk to beach. Rooms very small. No control over air conditioning. Have to call front desk to turn AC on and off. Staff courteous and helpful. Good breakfast. Hotel adds on service charge (10%) when you get the bill ..not advertised with rates and you have to pay in cash. Check your rates in reals' also if quoted in dollars by booking agen/site. The hotel may use their own currency conversion rate (lower)which might turn out to be more than what was quoted to you. We ended up paying more than we were quoted in dollars. 
3417,"Nice place for staying in Berlin, very good price for such standard. Next to the hotel perfect public transport, restaurant, pubs and local tourist attraction. Location in fancy Berlin district Kreuzberg."
3418,We arrived for breakfast about 20 minutes before it ended. All that was left in the hot plates were some frizzled bits of bacon and congealed scrambled egg. Such a pity as otherwise it would have been 5 stars all the way. We had booked breakfast the previous evening on arrival.
3420,"I stayed at Motel One for three nights in August 2015 and thought it was comfortable and decent lodging for the price.   Pros:  *Great location near Ku'damm and Zoo Station, swank shopping, trains to everywhere, the Tiergarten *Quiet and efficient air-conditioning/temperature control *Quiet rooms (mine overlooked office buildings and a train track) *Nice design in rooms (e.g., built-in shelves, two open closet areas)  Cons: *Wi-fi didn't work well for much of my stay *No phones in rooms *No clocks in rooms *No outlet next to desk *Liquid dual-purpose shampoo/soap offered but no bar soap, conditioner, or other toiletries *Entrance a little tricky to find  All in all, I would stay here again if I wanted to be in this part of town but would be more likely to stay in the eastern…"
3421,"Been there two times on business trips because i'm not the one choosing the hotels; if I did, i'd pass this one on every opportunity. Bad location: Leme, the very end of Copacabana Beach, dangerous for a night walk, terrible for getting taxi cabs (out of the usual path, only one one-way lane in...). Pool was closed both times. Breakfast is pretty standard, so is the room itself. There are better options nearby."
3422,"This is an old hotel which has seen better days. However the essentials are excellent. Our room was spacious and comfortable. The bed, like most hotel beds in Europe, was firm but well fitted out. The windows opened which is a bonus. The staff were helpful and made every effort to make our stay pleasant. We stayed for almost a week. It is true that the furniture could have been updated somewhat but it was clean and gracious with a history. The position so conveniently located to the train station and all the busses on the Ku’damm is unsurpassable. Then there is the breakfast which was generous and treated us to many varied culinary delights and reminded us of the happy Europe of bygone days.  We consider The Bristol is very good value for money. Thank you"
3423,"A really nice and friendly hotel close to both the train station and airport. We stopped twice here and the stay was great but issues with points not being added each time, the hotel is walking distance but construction work means a short diversion and paving uneven and dusty. Ok during day but personally I recommend the shuttle bus which is quick and easy."
3424,"Very disappointed with the hotel. The restaurant was good, and the hotel is on the river, but the room was very small, the bed was uncomfortable, pillows hard, bath very small and it was noisy.   A long, uphill walk to go to main attractions of the city."
3425,"This is a well-located hotel with all the standard amenities of a big business hotel in a big city and with friendly, competent staff.  But it's 2015, and it's time to have a recycling bin for paper in the rooms; there was plenty of space.  More seriously,  offering free wifi in the lobby but not in the room where I need it to conduct business with clients is a non-starter, and it was expensive in the rooms to boot; had I know this I would not have booked here.  Fortunately I was only there for a day-long meeting.  Here's a solution instead: go out the door of this hotel, walk 200 feet to your right, and stay at the Club Quarters.  Smaller rooms, but good service, and you will not be nickel-and-dimed in this annoying way.  That's what I will be doing for my next Chicago visit in…"
3426,"Nice enough, very good location, rooms are fine, just not inspiring.  We found the floor, although clean to be cold and uncomfortable.  Did not eat here as the food in Funchal is excellent so always somewhere else"
3427,"Our stay at The Villaggio Hotel Boutique was part of a three city honeymoon in Argentina. This hotel was our worst experience of the three. I gave it a rating of two instead of one for two reasons; it is in a good location and the breakfast (while not imaginative or varied) was of good quality. This was our experience- We checked in on a Sunday morning. When we got on the elevator to go to our room the desk clerk stuck his head around the corner and told us, ""By the way... the air conditioning in the hotel is out. But it should be fixed tomorrow."" Not typically being complainers we went to our room. After settling in for a few minutes we decided to get some breakfast and went downstairs. After inquiring about the hotel breakfast we were told that they would have to charge us…"
3428,"This is a pricey hotel that does not deliver its services as a 5 star hotel, AC does not work, and there are always waiting line at the lobby to check in or check out.  Food is not great and elevators don´t work properly.  In addition, some people of the staff are not always friendly. This hotel is in a good location but for this price and service,  it is good if you look for a hotel somewhere else"
3429,"The hotel is good, spacious rooms, nice views from the higher floors, breakfast was great too. But some staff members attitude darkened all the positive moments. They were not friendly at all, except the doormen who were always willing to help and greeted us every time, and the polite guy who filled the mini bar in the room.  In the Roca cafe it took ages for the waitress to just bring us a menu, they served us a dirty cup and a dirty napkin. And you do not expect to deal with this at a 5-star hotel.  Also during our stay, there were some celebrities in the hotel. And because of them, there were a lot of fans outside and inside the hotel and the staff was handling it poorly. One security guy even kicked out our guest who was waiting for us in the lobby. And after this, he didn't…"
3430,This is my pied à terre when I attend meetings in Paris. It is so well run and the rooms are small but bijoux. It has gone a bit upmarket in recent years since I first discovered it but it is still an endearing little place with a typical Parisian bistro attached serving wholesome meals at affordable prices.
3431,"This is a small and expensive hotel in downtown Lisbon and so the external environment is very mixed. High end shop fronts during the day double as accommodation for cardboard dwelling homeless people at night. The hotel interior is termed 'boutique', is clean and modelled on the nearby Gulbenkian collection. Rooms are reasonably spacious and cleaned well. Reception staff were courteous and helpful. Bar staff were knowledgeable about Portuguese wines.  The tiny basement restaurant is comfortable but easily overwhelmed at breakfast time and you may be asked to wait. This could be shrugged off as a minor point, but at the prices charged you might have believed that this niggle had been thought through. Suites cost around 500 euros a night and so to be told somewhat tetchily by one…"
3432,"Stayed here for 2 nights in May as I was attending a conference over the road (so location was amazing!). It felt a bit far away from the main parts of Berlin (but I guess a 30 minute walk to Alexandraplatz is not bad!). The room was fine for one person, bathroom clean and everything worked fine. I do like having a kettle and tea/coffee making facilities in the room which is good. I didn't have the breakfast. There was a supermarket, subway and restaurants about 5 minute walk away which is good. The reception staff seemed helpful and overall is was a very easy stay in a clean comfortable hotel."
3433,"We got a name of this hotel trough TripAdvisor site. We booked a room by phone -it was easy and pleasant conversation (I need to note this especially.) Geographically Hotel stayed in the very nice place- close to the river; bridge Luis; turistic information office; lot of restaurants around. In 20 minutes walking you can come to the center of old Porto. Building is very interesting also- looks like only facade and internal walls are from the old building while hotel's rooms ""inserted"" inside. Staff was very friendly and helpful. But place and staff are only2  things we can mark with good  value.  Rooms are too small; no place even to seat. Toilet and shower are actually placed in the corner of the room -with some kind of curtains (jalousie) on  the window between them and rest…"
3435,"We stayed there for one night. The room was nice but not 100% clean! Our shower gel was empty. The spa area was great - for 15€ you can use the pool, sauna and the hammam and you also get bathrobe and towels.  Great breakfast, nice and delicious restaurant. Very nice staff.  Easy to get to the city by trams, but very expencive and complicated with cabs. A few german channels but connected to netflix and spotify!"
3436,Nice clean Hotel not far from City center and Alexander Platz.Just a few meters away from Bus and Tram.Clean rooms and friendly staff.Good price too for a 2star Hotel.I am always happy with Ibis.Good wifi too       
3437,"The hotel is certainly in a good location, near Copacabana beach and all the restaurants, cafes and bars along the sea front, but it really does need refurbishment. The rooms had a musty smell and the flooring had seen better days. Airconditioners were wall mounted and very noisy"
3438,"Firstly, the hotel’s public areas look fantastic and up to standard we had expected.  Our room was another matter. Although it was a “deluxe” room it was far from this. It suffered from dampness. The bed felt damp. Our clothes after a day felt damp. Wallpaper was peeling off the walls and there was black mould on wallpaper in bathroom. It appeared that the fan in bathroom didn’t work.  Breakfast had a wide selection. However, hot food was always cold. We found the omelette station and it was the only hot food.  We ate in Benes one night. The starter was inedible and was returned. The main was less than average. It was an expensive meal for less than average food.  In the lobby bar we waited half an hour and still our drinks were not delivered. Other people came in after us drank…"
3439,"The apartment was cleaned daily and the towels most days. It is in need of decoration and refurbishment. One uncomfortable and one dining chair neither of which were comfortable. There was only one electric socket in the kitchen and no plug in the bathroom sink. No mattress covers on the beds. There is no lift. The views from our balcony, room 27,are great but there is a busy crossroads and traffic noise."
3440,"DONT STAY HERE IF YOU ARE A HARD WORKING PERSON TRYING TO HAVE A GOOD TIME!!!!! THEY RUINED MY WEEKEND AS WELL AS POSSIBLY MY CREDIT!  First off, the hotel itself is really nice for the price. I decided to surprise my girlfriend for our 3 year anniversary and take her to Chicago. I booked Springhill suites a week before and after reading all the reviews, i was so excited to get there! I requested an early check in time(which we got A+ there) and also a high floor room. Upon check in, we were told that the highest floor they had was the 5th floor. Keep in mind that i upgraded to the Corner Suite. I figured being in the fall, they tried filling up the first floors first. after we got settled in, we found new friends in the elevator and said that they also booked a week before and…"
3441,"First off the Pictures are real but when u get there its so much more to IT... first off I checked in late me and a friend and they gave us one bed  when i asked for two beds. the bed was like  a old mattress that when u sit down u go way down i was scared of bed bugs i went to wallgreens to get 95% alcohol to spray the bed ,i couldnt sleep all night .we got upgraded to room 219 and the bathroom was nice and thats it .the elevators  reminded me of the projects with grafftit on it and the  elevators of course were not working. i have went to MIAMI so many times and i see why i always walked passed this place and if u can PLEASE WALK BY .....and check your mattress disgusting"
3442,A very clean and beautiful hotel in the middle of everything. Nice and friendly personal who could tell us all information we needed. Many good restaurants around. A quiet and cosy place. Higly recommended.
3443,"Positive: + quiet and safe residential neighbourhood + nice breakfast with good service + good housekeeping and friendly reception (Raffael Guerra) + wifi stable, fast and free + beach within 10 minutes walking distance (a small passenger ferry is required to cross a canal, free)  Negative: - prices can be very high - business centre is a joke and cannot be used for working - rooms and interior are slightly dated - no wine glasses may be taken from the bar to the room, dusty plastic cups were offered instead - breakfast room is not very inviting - it can take up to 5 minutes to wait for and take a lift down from the top floor, also agility is mandatory as lift doors only open for a second or two  - taxi desk ushered me to an expensive (hotel?) limousine instead of a cheaper…"
3444,"Overall, my stay at the LaLit was sub-par. The front desk arranged a room for us upon arrival before check-in officially started--this was great!!! However, the end of my stay was a bit less nice. First, the hotel immediately cut off Wifi access upon checkout (the guest wifi can only be accessed with an Indian phone number, so if you are international then you can not get it), even though they knew we would be sticking around for a few more hours before our plane left India. In order to give us Wifi, they required we wrote a review on TripAdvisor which the staff then edited without my permission before posting, on an account which I can not access now to delete. We informed the concierge upon checkout that we would be leaving quite a few hours after checkout since our plane left…"
3447,"The entrance to the inn is quite promising, nice music and a lush green garden. The staff is very nice and patient. But the rooms are quite horrible, the beds are sunken and uncomfortable, no night lights near the beds, an ineffective aircondition apparatus and hardly any force in the shower-just dribling drops of warm water. I must say that I was surprised with several more things- the fact that you had to pay in advance for everything- the room, taxis and all the excursions. We felt a huge lack of trust! Where does one need to pay deposits too?"
3448,"This hotel gets a 2 star for its appearance, and that alone.  This 4 star hotel lacks in hospitality. The staff was rude and not accommodating to our needs, at all. My friends and I had perpetual issues getting into our rooms due to faulty key cards. For those who have occasional trouble adjusting to foreign chinese cuisine, as it was for me, it would have been ideal for our keys to work every time we used it. We also had to beg to get a new roll of toilet paper every day. The bedrooms had no wifi. Wifi was only available in the lounge area where there was more people using the wifi then there were chairs. Lastly, when we tried to check out, the desk clerk almost didn't allow us to use our credit card for no valid reason that I can imagine, other then to save the hotel on credit…"
3449,New owners have turned this once warm and welcoming place into a nickel and dime hustle with a chaotic and disengaged management and stressed and sad staff. Hotel Mgr walked off job week i was there(5/31-6/1) Arrive now to 2 signs telling you about 55 a night parking charge and 15 a day to use wi ifi and facilities. 3.00 charge for tiny generic water bottle in room. Valets no longer greet you at arrival or offer help with bags when you park in front of hotel. there was a 100 dollar difference in price of my mid week room charge. I have called to discuss bill and am shunted over to numbers that do not pick up for messages  last time I called given number that rings and then disconnects. Bed was like concrete slab had to pile up duvet and pillows to soften bed. So sad to see this…
3450,"Booked a king size room for two days stay. Room was no where close to what they had on website. Room was absurdly small, not enough towels, tiny bathroom, scary dark hallways, less than perfect sanitation (no plastic trash bags for example), thin walls & loud/drunk neighbors. Should have opted and paid little more & stayed somewhere else"
3451,"This is our 3rd visit to Funchal having previously had accommodation in the Lido area, some 2 Km. from the centre.We booked this hotel as it was in a good location for the Old Town, City Centre and having a sea front position in one of their Junior Suites. Having Checked In we made our way to our room and had a pleasant surprise with wine on ice and a vase of flowers on the table. We decided to leave the wine for later and put the kettle on. The kettle duly boiled but we couldn't find any milk, tea bags etc. I popped down to reception and requested the items. To my surprise I was informed that these items were only supplied to ""repeat stay"" guests. I questioned this as surely it was a language miscommunication......but no, this was correct, its hotel policy. I did comment that…"
3452,"This hotel is getting very dated, I can see it was once a 4 star but now is a little old and the adjoining shopping centre is abandoned and the neighbouring properties half built and haven't been worked on for years. On arrival we were given a room and upon entry found that it had not been cleaned at all and smelt like s night club. Needless to say we were quickly provided another room. Great view to the water across historic town. We used the hotel car park $7€ per night, the bar charges for pool which we thought was a bit rich $7.50€ per hour! 15min walk to town square and eateries, if you are looking for a night spot Riberia is good. Wifi was very average at the hotel and the pool / gym were nothing to write home about, don't believe the web site pictures.. 3 star at best!.…"
3453,"I live in SF, had to stay somewhere when my house was full of smoke from a downstairs neighbor. Found this place b/c it was cheap and it was late. Honest to GOD, if you are a tourist, DO NOT STAY HERE. This is in the worst neighborhood in San Francisco, and please, crime doesn't happen only at night. It happens all day, every day. I implore you to fork over the cash and stay at a better located place. This place is ashame. Sorry owners, but you know I am right."
3454,"Although the desk and front staff were quite helpful most of the time, this was a poor hotel experience.    The room had a balcony and a kitchen which was nice.  However there was no supplies to make a coffee or tea on the kitchen (making it pretty useless), the bathroom was very basic (no bench space to put stuff - just a sink on a wall), the toilet didn't always flush and there was no ironing board or iron!  The WiFi did not work all days.  The ""gym"" was 2 running machines in a room on the roof.  The breakfast offering was VERY basic (although admittedly it was not very expensive).  The lists were really slow old types (where you have to open 2 doors to get out).  I think I paid around US $200 per night.  Given the above, I thought it was very poor value!"
3455,"Let me start by saying that between my husbands travel for work and our many fun trips throughout the year, we spend an average of 130 nights per year in a hotel. We hold a Hilton Diamond status and always have an abundance of points to stay on— but due to the amazing view of this hotel we chose to suck it up and actually pay for a room  Good qualities: the view!!! The bed.   Bad qualities: they couldn’t find our reservation. Finally found it. Offered us 2 days of breakfast coupons. We arrived at breakfast time but were told we could not use them today. Why not? If you get 2 days worth why does it matter?   No bedding for the sofa bed. Called to get some and 20 minutes we had it. Asked where the pillows were and were told (and I quote) “no one said anything about pillows?” So 20…"
3456,"This hotel is on a quiet, very French street, a few minutes from a Metro line. Every time you enter or leave, you’re greeted with a great big smile, and offered any help you may need. Room was very clean, equipped with tv, espresso machine, a few pillows, and huge windows that can be opened up to a gorgeous city view. They also have a sauna downstairs, and the breakfast buffet (if not included in your stay, 13€ extra) is full of fresh fruit, meats, cheese, jams and breads. Would definitely stay again if I’m staying in Paris."
3457,"The rooms are literally like a jail cell: pillows are long, length-wise but your head will not fit on it; the beds are as hard as bricks and the windows do not open.  In my room, 228, the heating never worked! Nightmare.  When you arrive do not get a taxi to the hostel, it costs around 30 euros.  Leave the station via the rear exit and take a ferry across the water, then walk the 5 minutes through a park to the hostel.  The staff are friendly, and there is a good bar area downstairs."
3459,"Let me start with the one positive, the room was fantastic and had a great view of Grace and the park next door. Unfortunately that is where the good ends.  Problem 1 - We checked in Saturday at 3:00 and were told to give them 10-15 minutes when we needed our car. We requested the car about 5:15. After waiting 30 minutes both the doorman and bell hop checked on the car. The doorman returned from the garage a block away and informed us we would be better off walking the block and waiting for the car there. This normally would not be a big thing but one in our party was 90 year old gentleman and his 80 year old wife who uses a cane. After making our way the block to the garage we waited another 20 minutes for the car. That night when we returned I mentioned to the manager the car…"
3461,"I've been there for 3 nights and I absolutely loved it! It is a really comfy and cozy hotel, with clean and well equipped rooms, wi-fi is free and works perfectly; we didn't have breakfast because I honestly think that 15 € is too much; in the room there is a boiler with a selection of teas and coffee, you also will find a bottle of water but that is not for free (2 €). Staff was polite and kind, we left our luggages for free some hours after checking-out since our flight was in the afternoon and we wanted to spend the morning around the city. I don't give 5 star just because despite being in Mitte the location is not really central, I mean, Berlin center is really big so it is central but it is not a zone where you can find a lot of restaurants, bars, shops, etc. so don't…"
3462,"This is my second time staying here. The location is perfect. The Gaudi building is within walking (one is opposite and another one is just 5 mins walk). Many restaurants near by.  Room is fine. Only the toilet is concerned as there was no chad or door. If you are a couple, it would be fine seeing naked : ) but for a family and friend...someone need to wait outside while another one is taking a shower.  Overall I would recommend this place for the staying in Barcelona."
3463,"We stayed for 3 nights. We enjoyed the great views, being near wonderful landscapes and walks. It was also good to be away from Funchal and the coast. The room was cosy and the staff were friendly.  The room felt a little dated - especially the bedding and bathroom. The wifi didn't work for the entire time we were there."
3464,"This B & B has some great things going for it..As others have said, the location can't be beat. The buffet breakfast choices are AMAZING, and the breakfast staff and all other service is excellent. That said, our room was something of a disappointment.The toilet/sink area has a glass door, as does the separate shower area, so there's no privacy. Our room was both near the elevator and at the bottom of a staircase. The walls and door were paper thin, so the noise was constant.  If I'd known in advance that that was the only room which had 2 separate beds for my daughter and me, I would have gladly opted to share a bed with her in a quieter room. We also had trouble with the heating/cooling system. Though Daniel was more than glad to come and show me twice how to operate it, it…"
3465,"We stayed in this hotel because of the vicinity to Schonefeld airport.The bus number 171 stop is just next to the hotel,runs every 20 mins and takes you to the airport in 20 mins.Otherwise a taxi ride in the early morning costs around 18 Euros. The welcome in the hotel was great and the room basic but comfortable.Although the hotel is not exactly in the city centre is still not that far out and it was easy to reach with public transports,a combination of a S-bahn train and a bus."
3466,"Staff was really friendly and helpful and the room was spotless. It is really really cheap compared Lisbon prices so in that respect you get what you pay for  It boasts of a swimming pool - but it is so small with a lot of children (not complaining) around it was not the tranquil place to relax with a drink after a long day if you could find a place to sit.  Funny most people don't love the area but it was great. Lots of buses and close to Metro to take you to the city center. I loved the area - so nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of the old city. The area has great restaurants and cafe's   The breakfast buffet was nice and with a great variety, but the one morning we slept a bit late we had to stand in line to get in. Other guests told me it was like this every day…"
3467,"Excellent staff. Good clean rooms. Bathrooms are clean modern and functional. The breakfast is excellent. Located centrally in Lisbon. All of the above led to high popularity of this hotel and that has led to a high costs. As a customer, I need to rethink if I am still staying there or if it is time to find another hotel, with more competitive prices..."
3468,"This hotel is just awful, mostly due to the terrible hotel rooms.  I'm assuming this was supposed to be ""Havana Chic"" or something, but the room was tiny, I mean tiny, it was sparsely decorated, using wicker furniture.  No counter space in the bathroom, horrible closet, really dark rooms (only 2 lamps) and no air conditioning - only overhead fans.  We upgraded to a suite, with ""magnificent ocean views"" - urm, no, the window was also really small and afforded a nice view, but not sprawling and you couldn't open it for fresh air.  In addition 3/4 of the view was of the hotel/street next door.  We complained to the manager, who showed us another room - urgh - yuck!  It was even worse.  I honestly would describe it as a european hostel feel - metal bar on the wall as your closet. …"
3469,"Tired, dingy, dark and dreary hotel, living off of its obsolete reputation as a luxury hotel and its ideal location across from Union Square. The lobby is like a bus station, crowded with few places to sit. Service is mediocre. Room in serious need of up dating. But the food and beverages are over priced, so there’s that. "
3470,"This hotel is located in a quiet neighborhood. Great base for trips to the center of Berlin.t is a clean hotel with amenities such as a parking garage, swimming pool and fitness center. I will recommend this hotel to every visitor of Berlin."
3471,"Great hotel and service. Really good value for money. Apart hotel with cooking facilities, even though we didn’t use them. Lovely cafes and restaurants nearby. Also an organic supermarket opposite if you want groceries. Definitely recommend it"
3472,"The hotel itself is really nice with comfortable and large rooms with nice amenities that include free bottle of water and beer on a daily basis. The hotel is also reasonably affordable so you are really getting a good deal here.  The only thing to consider that if you are a tourist who is interested in seeing Berlin then this is not the ideal place as its far from Mitte (Central) and all the other sites, thou you have a train shuttle within 10 min walk.   Overall I wish I was closer to Berlin but as far as comfort goes i was certainly satisfied. Thou it's far from downtown Berlin, the area itself in Weissensee is very quaint, peaceful, and nice with a little park and lake by the hotel. If commute isn't an issue for you to downtown area and you looking for a quiet place,…"
3474,"Be careful when paying the incidental fee.  I checked in February 9th to the 10th, 2019 & have yet to get my Incidental Fee returned.  I've been battling with my Bank & this Hotel for weeks.  Wayne who is the property owner thinks he & his staff is doing me a favor by researching this.  I reminded Wayne that I am the customer & I am doing him a favor by patronizing his business.  He did not agree.  They are so unprofessional that I was drawn into their in-house battles.  Earlean the Front Desk manager told me via phone that she would be having a meeting with Wayne & Mary the accounting person.  When I spoke to Mary she denied ever having the meeting. Mary is not cooperative & not very helpful.  This is a good way to divert from the issue at hand which has not been resolved yet. …"
3475,"Our first time staying at  Le Cavendish Hotel  but definitely won’t be our last.  Superb welcome on arriving offered a glass of rose wine whilst we checked in and on being shown to our lovely spacious room ( room 480) were very pleased with the  huge bed and the walk in shower was very welcome.  The hotel is very near to the main area of Cannes and we had no problem in finding somewhere to have dinner every night, also used the train to go to Monaco, although it takes over and hour it does stop at every town, this helped us to decide where we would like to visit in the future, oh yes we will be returning we fell in love with Cannes.  We loved Monaco, best seen from the open topped bus, a perfect way to take it all in and part of the route was the Grand Prix route.  Just to say…"
3478,"The bedroom was no more than 10x10 with view of a brick wall 2 feet away. I've stayed in nicer rooms on the small side at hostels and definitely don't feel the room was worth the $200+ I paid.   Wall AC unit, not built in. Easy to hear noise in the corridor without the AC on.  Bathroom is in need of updating. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone."
3479,"For a premium priced hotel we were very disappointed. Awkward room layout, cheap furniture, tiny awkwardly positioned tv, paint peeling in the bathtub and a paper thin door between the next room resulting in little sleep due to noisy neighbors.  Huge waste of money. Don't bother."
3480,Check in was at 4 PM and we arrived at the Moxy at 3:40 PM. When we  tried to check in they told us our reservation  would not be honored. They said there were no rooms available except for one that had a supposed leak and could not be used. Even though we were there before check-in time they claimed that there were a lot of people that checked in even earlier than us and that there were absolutely no rooms available. They could not honor our reservation. They were not at all sympathetic or  very apologetic. They told us that they made us a reservation at a courtyard Marriott a couple of miles away and that was it.  No other compensation was given.  Signet this is a brand new hotel you would think they would want to make a better first impression with guests. I have never in all…
3481,"- very good breakfast- very polite, nice and helpful personal- downside with the spa zone pretty small and the only pool there is is with cold water (it consists in !8 sunbeds, one pool, a steam sauna and a finish sauna)"
3482,"This hostel was our first stop on a 3 week European adventure and was one of my favorite places we stayed (we did a mix of hostels and Airbnb’s). The staff were very friendly and let us arrive early and leave our bags with them before our rooms were ready. We booked a 4 bed mixed dorm but ended up having the whole room to ourselves for the duration of our trip so we basically got a private room for the dorm price (which was amazing!). Air conditioning was not on at first so it was slightly musty, but after an afternoon that went away. Comfortable beds and we appreciated the private bathroom and secure entrances. Very close to multiple metro line stops so it’s super easy to get around Paris. I would recommend getting the multi-day tourist pass that gives you unlimited metro and…"
3483,The rooms need a face lift as many furnishing and fittings have aged and look pitiful. The check in and check out took too much time. Most customers looked upset for rooms not ready when they arrived to check - in.
3484,"We stayed over 1 night on our way to the North Coast of California.  We choose this hotel because of the reviews, the price and location to the 101.  We were sadly disappointed.  The hotel is undergoing renovations, which they did not tell us.  There was trash everywhere and not just construction trash (carpet, etc..) there were dirty towels and sheets, lying in the passage way that looked as though they had been there for a while, there were fast food containers everywhere, just thrown on the ground and it looked like the trash had not been emptied in many weeks.  There were cigarette butts overflowing the containers and stunk to high heaven (right outside our window by the way) and trashcans from the rooms, lying around the outside.  They could have done so much better at…"
3485,New hotel in Lisbon centre. Fantastic reception that helps you in any kind of request (not so easy to find) Fantastic breakfast  Beautiful room. I give 3 point only because a bit small room. Innovative services like an iPhone in the room for your necessity. Positive experience! Recommended 
3486,"A bit to far drom the center by foot. Center for me is where Cass Battlo and Casa Mila is. A bit far to Sagrada Familia too. Metro station is not very close, with a long stairs. Not good for luggages. So the best transportation to the city center (passieg de gracia, placa catalunya) is by bus no.7, it’s very near bus station. Buy the T10 ticket at the metro station, can be used for all public transport. The room was clean, but apparently they didn’t clean all floor. And the things in the room didn’t add up everyday. Like tea/coffee/mini bar, about 3 days they didn’t add. Check in process was tooooo long. Even want to ask a very simple question have to wait long time. The trainee girl was so untrained, The breakfast was good, but after 3 days you will feel bored. And pricey…"
3487,"Stayed here 4 nights before heading to Kauai. Back to Oahu I booked a different hotel. Place is not super nice, but the worse to me was the staff and management. On my last day I saw a beetle running on the corridor next to the elevators. I reported to staff at reception and they didn't seem to care. Once back it was still there, so I asked to talk to the manager. He literally said to me that it was something 'normal', he didn't care. Seriously?, normal to find a cockroach in the 6th floor corridor? Not very clean, I will certainly not recommend. Location is good for beach, but the area is full of homeless and weirdos day and night right at the frontdoor... feels unsafe"
3490,"Terrible management, this hotel does not deserve to be a Ritz Carlton. Made several attempts to speak with their GM and was told to email her. Sent multiple emails and never once got a response. Much better hotels within walking distance. I will never stay at this property again and I also had them removed from my corporate portal."
3491,"I have now stayed twice at this hotel. The location is very convenient for exploration of the historical Mitte, the museums of the Museum Insel and the shopping of Friedrichsstrasse. Also, the location is just a short walk from the Gendarmenmarkt, the Staatsoper (though closed for renovation) and the Komische Oper, not to mention the Kit Kat Club.  Rooms are modern and very silent, with comfortable beds. WiFi is free and good. I would like more generous portions of soap and shampoo. Views are nothing special.  The breakfast buffet is generous and priceworthy, as the rooms!  Service is friendly and efficient."
3492,"Excellent location with plenty of buses from outside the hotel or a 20 minute walk into the centre of Funchal.   Large and comfortable lounge and bar area. Dining room small and two sittings for dinner to accommodate all guests. Allocated a specific table for dinner during the stay. Free seating at breakfast and could be crowded if there were a couple of big groups both wanting feeding at the same time....  Was part of a large group and hotel allocated separate tables to us all. Being a single I was given a table well away from the rest of the group, who were placed by the window. I was tucked in a back corner by the wall. Made me think this hotel treats singles as second class citizens.   Buffet style meals with plenty of choice. Breakfast excellent with fresh fruit, cold meats…"
3493,"The hotel is beautiful with a lot of activity for families. Right next to a beautiful beach and a spacious swimming pool. Great for a 2 day staycation. However, the area around is quite dead for any parties or even dinner which closes around 10. We were a little dissapointed that the hotel didnt give us good i formation about where to enjoy the nighlife in the city center which was open till 2am! They also dont provide ironing board in the room which was quite inconvinent. The breakfast buffet is good. The alacarte restaurant is average with high prices and not enough options on the menu. "
3495,Good location  a few minutes walk from the metro station.  Efficient check-in process.  I had a single room which was a little on the small side but given that I was only in it to sleep that was not really a problem. Bathroom was of average size. The main down side was that my bed did not have a head board and the head end was not up by the wall so my pillow had a tendency to slip onto the floor at times during the night. ( this is the reason I dropped a star) it was not possible to move the bed to a better position.  Breakfast was a buffet with a range of the usual buffet choices you would expect. There was plenty of food on offer. Great value for money. 
3496,The hotel has a nice proposal and the service is super friendly. The decoration puts you in the right mood for the theme. The breakfast buffet is rich and the rooms are different to anything you've seen before. 
3497,"My wife and I stayed here for 5 nights during this years carnival period. The staff were mostly polite and helpful.There are some good points to the hotel, like it's excellent location and reasonable prices, but we were disappointed in too many respects for me to award it five stars. First of all, it has only two lifts to service 20 floors, and the lifts are so small they feel crowded with just five occupants. Being located on floor seven, we often had to watch as full lifts continue past us because they were either filled in the lobby by folks on higher floors, or were already filled to capacity before reaching us on the descent. Our next gripe was with the rooms coffee/tea maker. No milk was ever supplied, and only highly flavoured teas were available. On asking why we had no…"
3498,"The only positive about this hotel is that it is in a good location. The hotel is old, dated and needs a refurbishment. The pictures on booking websites must be very old as the hotel doesn’t live up to the pictures. Our room was meant to be a double room but it had 2 tiny what I would describe camp beds in it. We hardly saw any staff and won’t be staying here again."
3500,"Luxury hotel, with Olympic sized pool and the worst customer service I've ever experienced all across the board. Not one instance, not twice but too many to keep track of.  The level of miscommunication among the staff is unreal. First time I called I spoke to young woman who clarified that the hotel does not hold incidentals on a daily basis but instead they just keep your credit card on file. A week before arrival I notice in the fine print of the reservations it mentioned that there was a $125 charge per night held.  I called the hotel and spoke to Vicky and she was so rude and arrogant when explaining the ""policy"" to me that I asked to be transferred to a manager, instead, Vicky hung up the phone on me.  I returned the call and spoke to AJ who did the same, hung up the line…"
3501,From the beginning to end was absolutely bad and exhausting. The workers didn't care. Gave our room away when we paid in advance and tried giving an excuse. Room was ok but the frig was old ad nasty. They couldn't find our car then lied about having a manager on site 
3502,"Pros: - price - beds and pillows - nice reseption area - free and fast wifi - friendly staff - metro station nearby  Cons: - really basic breakfast. Basically there was bread (w/ ham and cheese), serials and fruits. Coffee and some sweet for dessert. Thats it. - A/C was not working in 2nd floor - smell in the bathroom was bad. I think there was some moisture in structures.  Despite all the cons, I enjoyed three nights there. You might want to eat your breakfast elsewhere if it isn´t included in the price.  From airport: Taxi approx. 35€ Bus to city center approx 5€, you can get to the hotel with L4 metro line (Llacuna) or L1 (Glories). Llaguna is nearest stop, but you can the L1 line is better if you are going to centre. Train from airport to Passeig de Gracia and there to L4…"
3503,Hotel staff was very friendly and had a very timely check in. Rooms and bathroom were very clean. Not undersized like most European hotel rooms.  It’s in a very nice location within close proximity of good shopping and restaurants. Close to the subway/train station.
3504,"I was concerned as the hotel has mixed reviews, however I booked a room that looked reasonable and had a good sea view. Unfortunately whan I checked into my room I found that I had to walk out onto a large balcony for the water views.  When I checked with reception I was told that there was only one room that had the water view photographed.  I was shown 2 small apartments that had water views if I stood in the right place in the bedroom otherwise I had a view of a blank wall.  The apartment I stayed in was run down and looked like it would appeal to workers, the sofa was stained, the bathroom had 2 showers, one a half round and portable looking next to the bath and one over the bath.  The one over the bath was the only one that worked. Breakfast had limited western food with…"
3506,"We stayed here for 3 nights. Hotel is in a good location and easy to get to. Our room was very clean, although we had requested a higher floor upon booking but were on the 1st floor. I was worried about traffic noise and although there was noise, it didn't disrupt sleep and I'm a very light sleeper. Our shower head wasn't working but this was fixed very quickly. Only downside to room was lack of bedside table on both sides. We also used the gym which was small but well equipped. Would recommend this hotel as a base for sightseeing in Berlin. "
3508,"I was looking for a exciting weekend for bringing in the New Years with my family on Sunday .After a terrible check in experience...long wait, dirty room, broken phone in room, barking dog in room next door, our family had started to get aggravated and the first day of our vacation was not starting out on the best note. I called down to front desk and spoke with the  Front Desk Supervisor, Chris - I explained the situation of several small bad experiences contributing to a bad overall I recieved nothing but arrogance and not listnening or not expressing concern...Something every customer service manager should know didnt make it any better..However the  night manager fix the problems and offer me to move to another floor. Thanks to the night manager for trying to make our stay…"
3509,"Despite my preference for being away from the lifts having been on file for the past 10 years, gave me a room next to the lift. When I queried this, did not seem that interested at the time The lady on check out was much better and apologised for the mix up Otherwise staff were very helpful  Rooms are fine"
3511,"I always stay at this hotel when I visit Paris and I will continue to do that. It is very convenient, close to Opera, Madlen, Galeries Lafayette and Printemps Haussmann. Avenue Champs-Élysées 15 minits by walk. "
3512,I have to say this is  the smallest room I have ever  seen barely enough room to get into bed   Had  to put luggage in bathroom so we could get  to the door  the elevator is only big enough for 2 with luggage  We were on the 4th floor  it was like a maze to get to your room  The restaurant  for breakfast  was a good deal  & the food  was good  location was good  but  if you must stay there opt  for a larger room ($$$)
3513,Just back from a three night stay at this hotel.  Top marks for:  cleanliness Staff Location Breakfast  Transport links a few feet away with lots of bars and eateries within walking distance  Would highly recommend for a short stay it’s perfect for when you have been out all day and night and want a good sleep
3514,"We booked on Hotwire and this was advertised as a 3 star hotel. We were put in a room with four bunk beds, no amenities at all, and no television. It was a one star room.   We did not stay.  According to their website there are some hotel rooms, but what we were placed in did not qualify. "
3515,"We were greeted with a welcome package with a couple snacks, water and bottle of wine. Otherwise, the room was waaaay smaller than the picture and customer service was lacking. We went down to pick up breakfast at 5:56 and were rudely turned away because they don't start handing out bags until 6. Worst of all, we woke up to ROACHES in our room!!! We immediately called front desk who notchlantly told us to wait until management arrived at 9! We ended up packing up all our stuff before they became roach infested and hung out at a nearby diner until management arrived. Luckily we videotaped the roaches because management didn't seem to believe us and just gave us a minor discount on an already overpriced room only after seeing the footage."
3516,"We came for a 24 hr business trip in Berlin. This is our fifth stay at he hotel. We chose it again because the location of the hotel is excellent, and the hotel offers all the necessary amenities for such trips. The hotel layout is very friendly and pleasant. A perfect choice in our view. "
3517,"Spacious , clean , superb staff, location can not be faulted, easy access to underground , bus and trams  and a very good underground ( secure) car park ...but our room was 86 stairs in the roof. This was not advertised and made things like popping down to the garden for a coffee or going to the cafe over the road too much of an effort. So my advice is book this hotel as soon as you can but either be very fit or make sure you have a first floor room"
3518,"To stay, choosing the right endorsement is key. Les Piaules was my home for a week in Paris; it is modern, clean, centrally located and the staff is wonderful. At the reception, Juliette was my go to person for where to eat; Tony proved to be a master navigator; and what I relish the most is peppermint tea and honey from a lovely lady at the bar who learned that I was down with cold. Les Piaules was more than I could ask for and definitely money’s worth. You do not want to stay in the suburbs and waste time traveling to Paris."
3519,"Good location, close to old town, close to fashion valley, close to all important highways. Breakfast is OK too. Large lobby with coffee in the morning and water during the rest of the day. Staff looked unhappy. And biggest disappointment was that when I was really not satisfied about service quality during the latest breakfast and put 0.00 USD as tips later I discovered in the check-out's bill 5.00 USD. Disgusting"
3520,"We really loved this boutique hotel.  Location is great, with drinks and tasty tapas just out the door; close to two major metro stations;  walkable, though a trek, to Barceloneta, La Sagrada Familia, Barri Gotic,  Gracia and points in between.  The building itself is beautiful with a lovely inner courtyard, terrace in back and beautiful historic details.  Our room was large with balconies overlooking La Rambla Catalunya.  Bed was comfortable.  The green bathroom tile is gorgeous and the shower was very good.  Staff were warm, welcoming, efficient and super helpful with information and recommendations, including perfect hand drawn maps (thank you, Johan!).  The free wifi hotspot was an unexpected bonus.  The complimentary croissants for breakfast were delicious on day one...but…"
3522,"Great views at breakfast, and delicious breakfast.. but the hotel rooms are gross.  Beds not comfortable, No hott water, and horrible soaps. Not recommended to stay here..... Stay across the way at the Pestana. much better rooms.   This shouldn't be considered a 4 star hotel at all."
3523,"The parking is good and secure, great breakfast selection and friendly reception. Room lacks working table might need to go to the lounge. Otherwise good Internet connections.Cleaning staff could be more friendly at checkout"
3524,"In its day it was probably OK, however it is now a very tired and sad reflection of its past. The apartments are woefully furnished with Plato's garden furniture, lacking an oven and with kit hen equipment that makes using it as a self contained unit all but impossible.  The location is still excellent, although the entire Marina area is now showing signs of stress under the economic downturn of Europe in general.  We spent two weeks in a two bedroom apartment - we wouldn't go back again and we wouldn't recommend it.   There were far too few sunbeds around the pool, which ( contrary to previous response from the management) were all reserved by the ubiquitous use of towels, by 10 in the morning !"
3525,"Just completed a three week Europe trek and maybe this hostel was probably the worst one I stayed in. That being said, it's not that bad, just some good with some bad. The location is good, close to Dam square and the central station. Walking distance to everywhere. The washrooms have enough showers and toilets and they are clean enough. They offered a decent breakfast in the morning that will fill you up. They make a point of not making sandwiches for the rest of the day.. The bad... two of the staff members there, while not directly rude, certainly have a degree of arrogance. Asking a question was more difficult than asking for a favor from the godfather. But there were some other helpful staff members. One other huge negative, in a dorm bed of 20, there was no one to charge…"
3526,"We stayed for 6 nights in June 2019. Check in and check out was fast. The kitchen facilities was good for our quick breakfast before we start off our day. Staff are friendly and having the cold cucumber water at the lobby was so refreshing after a hot day of walking around in Berlin.   Location wise, it is very very good. And the hotel is pretty new.   If there is one thing, I wish they provide complimentary bottle of water daily instead of just one bottle for our entire 6 nights stay."
3527,"Just a 10 minute bus (X9) ride from Tegel Airport Berlin (2.70 euro), this is a tidy modern hotel with adequate rooms of various levels of luxury. The breakfasts are typically continental. While the hotel is not in the center of town it is on a major bus route and close to underground stations. A short walk 20 mins gets you to the Berlin Opera House and associated resturants & bars. Charlottenburg Palace a similar distance the opposite way."
3529,"Lisbon has good transport connections - trams, buses, metro etc - but it's a bit confusing, as are the ranges of tickets you can buy. This hotel can be reached by bus and metro but you need to know which is best. Alameda Metro stations is possibly nearest but there's a steep hill between it and the hotel. Saldanha is not much further away but the approach to the hotel is flatter - a consideration when pulling cases or after a day walking round the city attractions. Both are on the red metro line from the airport - Saldanha just one stop further than Almadena. The hotel itself is dated but we found it clean and the staff welcoming. We had requested a twin-bedded room but were given a large king sized room. However were quickly offered  the type of room we requested. Near Saldhana…"
3531,It's a girl's trip and the 3 of us enjoyed our stay at Junior Suite of the hotel very much.  The Junior Suite is quite spacious and the bathroom and toilet are separated which offers us more convenience.  All the hotel staff that we met were very friendly and helpful.  There was a balcony and we enjoyed so much to have our breakfast and dinner (a bit chill though) at the balcony to enjoy the old Paris building view.
3532,"A very stylisch hotel in excellent location an the Ramblas, very nice terrace in the courtyard, good beds and great ambience. Very helpful staff in the front desk Staff at the Croissant delivery war rather unfriendly"
3534,"I stayed at Turtle Bay for 6 days on a business trip in December. I will start by saying this hotel certainly is more geared toward leisure travelers and tourists as they do not have many amenities that business travelers are used to, like working Wi-Fi. The internet here is poor at best. Do not expect to get any work done while in the hotel, I had to rely on spotty cell coverage for internet most of the time. Additionally, the hotel is severely lacking in the service department. There were many time I had to wait exceptionally long for easy tasks - like waiting 30 minutes to refresh an unmagnetized room key.  They also don’t have same day laundry service - which I find ludicrous in a hotel this expensive. Throughout the week it seemed like everyone had someone else to blame for…"
3535,We stayed there for 5 days.. Half the time the elevators didn't go to our floor (the button didn't work).  Not classy!!!  The beds weren't that great! Bathroom was very small!!  The cooking area doesn't have enough counter space in order to cook anyway or a store to buy anything to actually cook!!!  Good location.  Small sitting lobby!!!!! Small bar but fun! Smallest pool I've ever seen!! Staff were pretty nice!
3536,"The biggest issue with this hotel, is that Berlin has no centre, so you are always having to travel to somewhere. But the public transport links are great and this hotel is therefore well placed. Service, cleanliness, breakfasts etc were great and would definitively use again if in Berlin!"
3537,"This hotel is old, beds are in worse shape than the 100 years old building, asked for low profile pillows and they are not available, they gave me a two full size bed (horrible) . Not to mention the neighborhood, forget walking the streets after 7pm. Only good thing is very close to BART subway. I will never come back here."
3538,"From bed to room to amenities, everything is terrible Feels like a cheap hotel in a nice location. Bar and entrance is good but rooms and bathroom amenities are awful . I was traveling for work and chose this due to closeness to workplace. Will not go there next time"
3539,"Overall while the hotel is beautiful and the location is great, we were disappointed as it didn’t meet our expectations as a 5 star property.    Our junior suite, while on a high floor, faced the wall of one side of the hotel.  The Hermès amenities described only materialized when we asked for them.  There is no turndown service.  The restaurant where the included breakfast is served was at capacity on 2 of the 4 days we were there, so we were relegated to a makeshift dining area.   Overall it was just too expensive given what we experienced to justify the expense.   We will be returning to Lisbon, but will look for other accommodations as we cannot recommend this property.    "
3540,"The best thing in this hotel is the view on the ocean , I really love it. The staff at the reception desk was really nice and helpful equally staff in the restaurant. I think that the restaurant in this hotel is the best in  Porto Moniz.  Thing that made my stay in this hotel not so lovely is the fact that we couldnt get one really clean towel! even when we asked for the celan one we got the towel with the blot again. Also we have dirty bedclothes when we arrive to the hotel. So we asked the receptionist to change them but because it was int he evening we have to wait until the other day to change them. But we have to ask once more to change the bedclothes and we waited until 17:00 till  clean lady finally came to our room to do her job. I must say that clean ladies in this…"
3541,"Traveller beware. Do not stay at this hotel. It is next to fire station so you will hear sirens all night. My laptop was ""missing"" from my room and not recovered. The staff was dismissive and were reluctant to acknowledge my concern. I had to ask if they had any ""Gold"" benefits at check in, and did not feel like a valued customer who stays with Hilton brands over 16 times a year. Will not return, and would encourage guests to stay elsewhere."
3542,"Got a room here as part of a package bought at Costco.com  Promised a 1 bedroom suite.  Got a large hotel room with a flimsy, broken divider that makes 1side a bedroom.  The bed is comfortable.  Wicker furniture reminds me of the last time when I was in Maui.  It was period appropriate in 1985.  Fail.  Free continental breakfast was picked clean within 15 minutes and not restocked.  Fail.  Room has dirty decade old carpet, a poorly finished bathroom, old, outdated fixtures, tile, appliances, cabinets, TVs, the doors don't latch because they are all warped, the Internet connection is unreliable, slow, and doesn't work on my iPhone.  Fail, fail, fail.  Rollaway bed... 30$ a night... Complete garbage.  Looks like it is 20 years old.  Fail.  The beach and grounds are OK.  Great…"
3544,"Great location, cute fitout, but the building is old and the 'modern' looking elevator was broken a few times during our stay.  No big deal for us as we are fit and can take the stairs, but we saw an elderly lady who had to be carried up the stairs and can imagine that this would not have been very fun for her.  The rooms are tiny and the sink is in the room by the bed, not in the tiny bathroom.  The storage space is pretty clever, but there is barely any space to move.  The cute modern fitout barely hides the age of the very old building.  For us this hotel was good value with yummy breakfast and an excellent location to explore Lisbon from, but it is not for everyone so think before you book."
3545,excellent location.  We got an upgrade which was nice and the room was lovely.  The Hotel was very well located. i would definely stay here again.  As they say loaction location loactaion!!  Thanks so much for a lovely stay
3546,"The hotel itself is ok, rooms are good. The food was a big let down, we only had B & B as we wanted to eat out a lot, good job we did. The breakfast was ok but very boring. We tried the dinner buffet one night and found it very uninteresting and a poor selection."
3547,"Now, first is this a 5-Star hotel? No. does this have 5-Star value? Absolutely! Two blocks from Notre Dame Cathedral on the left bank in the heart of the Paris Latin District. The price is very very very very affordable in comparison. Our unit was 133 euro per night. We had access to laundry (no charge) and breakfast each morning to include a traditional bread based French delicacy.   Now, the location and the cost make up for the one draw back = no lift! Only a narrow spiral staircase to our unit on the fourth floor. We got our steps and our exercise in! But the value and location is what is important here! Staff spoke English as well.  Other added perks included a boat tour and they would more than help you book taxis and give advice for getting around!"
3548,"We took a room on the top floor with a balcony and we loved it from when we arrived til the day we left. The room was big enough for us as the large bed and balcony was more than enough to make up for the room size. The place is spotless and very well decorated and if you have a room with a balcony you'll be so pleasantly surprised at the view and vibe you get when enjoying time on it. The suburb really is classy and quiet with very easy access to public transport as well as a multitude of shops and restaurants. You pretty much have everything you need right around you. The WiFi is very fast and the breakfast buffet is great, even for a big guy like me. You won't get bacon and scrambled eggs but if you're in paris you'll soon learn to do things the French way anyway and the…"
3550,"The hotel lies on a pedestrian street which is almost occupied by a lot of restaurants especially at night. The room and bathroom were clean but very small and therefore don't think about staying in the room except for sleep. The free Wi Fi was OK. The room felt hot most of the time, the AC was not working and we were told that they don't put it on after the Summer season , on the other hand we avoided opening the window because of the outside noise. The breakfast was nice especially the famous Nata and the fresh orange juice. The staff at the reception were friendly and spoke good English. The hotel has an excellent location, you can walk to most of historical Lisbon, the airport shuttle stop (Restauradores) is only 3 minutes walk , the metro stop is just round the corner, the…"
3552,"My room was a good size, on the top floor, with windows overlooking the street and park. It was clean and comfortable - functional rather than luxurious.Staff were friendly, welcoming and helpful, and breakfast (included in the remarkably reasonable room rate) was more than adequate. Everything worked. The real plus points for me were the value for money and the location - very close to transport links and in easy walking distance to the lively Kreuzberg district. I will go back."
3553,"This is the hotel to seek out if you're in Cannes. Unlike most hotels in this city, they don't make problems, they solve them. And they're so efficient that problems rarely occur. The place itself is clean, comfortable and classy. The pool is small but swimmable and they pack at lot of creature comforts into a relatively small space. I will come back, year after year."
3554,"I stayed at the Hotel de Varenne for a month this April, and I can honestly say it became my home-away-from-home while I was in Paris.  It is elegant and refined without being stuffy or pretentious, and its location in the 7th arrondissement, is perfect. It is far enough away from the tourist crowds, making it perfect for those like me who appreciate peace and quiet after a hard day's sightseeing, but located within mere minutes to the Rodin and D'Orsay Museums, and close enough either on foot or via the metro  to virtually any attraction in Paris your heart could desire.    I stayed in a superior double on the top floor with a view of the Eiffel Tower and the charming courtyard, and,although I was traveling solo, it would have been fine for two people.  The bathroom was…"
3555,"My wife I have recently returned from a 10 day stay at this hotel whilst I was competing in a week long golf tournament. This was our third visit having been three years previously when everything was very good and again three year before that. We were extremely disappointed, especially in the standard of food provided and the service in restaurants. The breakfast buffet was average to say the least. The Pizza parlour within the hotel grounds was very poor  with atrocious service -we waited well over two hours for our food despite repeated requests to the staff. The food at a final night Gala Dinner was cold, served on cold plates again with very poor service. The only saving factor for us was the meal we had in the Al a Carte restaurant which was very good. However the…"
3556,"Anna and Simon treated us like family as soon as we reserved the apartment. It’s so rare to find such accommodating and genuine people. Unfortunately, the elevator to the floor we were staying (4th floor) was being repaired. My family used only one big bag for the trip, but that didn’t stop Simon from insisting on carrying my bag up 4 floors!!  This should give you an idea of how serious they are about customer service. The apartment is the nicest I’ve stayed at in Europe and I’ve been traveling Europe for over 3 years (military stationed in Germany). They made a point of keeping the old styling and architecture present while modernizing the kitchen and bath...and everything else!  The bed was super comfortable, the shower was nice and new and had great water pressure. This…"
3557,"he hotel is in a perfect location - but that is all I can really say about it. We booked two rooms here - one was a suite with a balcony facing the water and a room for our son also facing the water. Our room was one of their most expensive rooms, Neither rooms that we booked matched what was on the internet. This hotel has the very best position. The staff service needs to be improved - they need to learn to answer the phones within 3 rings or at the most 5 rings. For a classification of one of the World Leading Hotels, it falls short in comparison with other hotels in its category. The breakfast was amazing and a lot of variety. They greet you with a glass of port when you get there and that is really nice. I am not yet convinced that this hotel provides you with value for…"
3558,"long birthday weekend in Berlin, made even better by your excellent hotel. location was great, room was very clean and modern. Staff we very friendly and super helpful. Breakfast was a bit expensive. Overall one of the best hotels ive stayed in for a long time. We'll be back! "
3559,"Great hotel. Clean, comfortable room with a very nice bathroom.  Shower was very relaxing, used it every chance I could. Had a balcony view over the Gare de L'est. The room was a classic room, which was a bit on the small size by UK standards, but perfectly formed. Free wi-fi in the rooms, and the location of the hotel is conveniently just a few steps away from Gare de L'est or a short walk to Gare de Nord.   Slept very well here. Definitely recommended."
3560,"We chose this hotel to experience the feel of a Paris neighborhood and were not disappointed.  Jerome and Vacine at the reception desk were welcoming and very helpful with navigating the metro, language pronunciations and places to eat.  Located west of the city center, it is out of the mainstream but very convenient to all of Paris attractions using the metro.  On our first day, we explored the neighborhood and found an open air market spanning several blocks with vendors of fresh produce, fresh fish, baked goods, cheese, meat and clothing.  We liked both the Belle Mere and Tramway restaurants - both a short walk from the hotel.  We would highly recommend this hotel based on overall value, hospitality, cleanliness and getting a true feel of a Paris neighborhood."
3561,"Very Nice hotel,very close to subway and railway station,and also at a short walk from shops and restaurants. Very good connected to Most tourist areas. Rooms are very clean,confortable beds and very nice personnel."
3562,"Stayed at the Hotel Otto for a long weekend and was impressed. The hotel is in a great location and ideally situated for easy access to stations, bars and good restaurants. The rooms are roomy , the beds very comfortable and the breakfast service is certainly something of note. The staff are courteous and always happy to help. Wifi is free and fast !! We will be returning !!! The only one downside was the rooms we had on the front which got the sun all day did get very hot and we were unable to open the windows at night due to the noise of the street - so Air con would have been greatly appreciated - friends who stayed in rooms at the back had no issues with street noises so could open their windows at night."
3563,"Excellent location in the city. Good breakfast. Very kind and helping staff.. A little bit noisy during weekend nights. Bathroom was badly designed, no space at all for own things (no table, no hooks) and water was easily spilled all over the bathroom because the peculiar red small sink was in the middle of the room. Bathroom door did not close at all (sliding glass door)."
3564,"Last time i booked 10 rooms in this hotel for my stay. This time I was surprised to see that the hotel has changed its work ethics. Last time when I wanted to extend stay They told me to book via make my trip as it was cheaper . This time they forced  me to book on counter only and told me they will not accept booking from online channels.   Then Their Valet Parking, They took keys of my car and gave me a valet parking slip which said..Parking at Owners RIsk. When I am giving you keys of my car , How on the earth it should be my risk??? When I asked about key,,,They said if you take keys we wont be responsible for your car.   Then They forgot my only luggage bag in Lobby and nobody even cared to see that bag and send it to my room. Morning breakfast was also not as good as it…"
3565,"Not the place where I would spend my holidays, but the perfect spot for a short stop. Clean, comfortable and quiet (small) room, great bathroom. Many restaurants fator every taste/budget, at walkable distance. Agreement with the very close and secured carpark (16 euros instead of 32, for 24 hours). "
3566,I had bad experience with housekeeping as they did not clean my room and when i informed reception about it no body take action. Bad management ever . I asked house keeping to clean my room at 9:30 pm. 
3567,"Great location for exploring Paris! On a quiet street. Very friendly staff. Clean rooms,  albeit small ... but hey, this is Europe! We didn't have the breakfast at the hotel but there are plenty of great spots in the neighborhood where you can grab a bite. Highly recommend staying here!  Great value for an expensive city."
3569,We stayed in vienna house for three nights in August. The hotel is 30 meters away from tram and 100 from train. It’s easy accessed from sxf airport via train (about 35’). Also the center of city is easy accessed from hotel (about 15’). The room was very clean and comfortable. The bed was large and bathroom really clean. Breakfast was excellent and stuff very friendly. I definitely recommend the hotel for those who want to explore Berlin!
3570,"We stayed here for 4 nights and explored as much of the city as we could, by walking and the Tour bus. Berlin is a good city to see by bicycle and the hotel hires them for 10 euros per day, which is a good deal.   The hotel is just about 7 minures walk from Checkpoint Charlie and 25 minutes walk to Brandenburg Gate, so easy access to many local points of interest en route. Rooms were comfortable, and the staff were pleasant and helpful.  Hotel cost was fairly standard, with the bonus of it being in a quite area.   The evening menu was a bit restrictive, and the food not brilliant, but acceptable. ( although breakfast choice and quality is good). The evening munu was not great value for money.There is however a good Italian restuarant about 300 metres from the hotel and various…"
3572,"Staffs were unhelpful and some were borderline rude. Staffs don't really speak English. Concierge was horrible, never helped me with my bags both in and out. They didn't even bother to tell the taxi my destination even when asked. The room was ok, rather small. The toilet never flushed properly. The hated it that pit the sink outside the bathroom. Don't stay here if you don't speak mandarin."
3573,"Service is great, but the hotel itself needs improving.   It is a bit dated.   Floors have odd old smell and machinery is in need of repairs. Rooms are large but storage is limited.  I'm sure it was great in its heyday.  Nicer places on the same block. "
3574,"Book your own transfer to and from this villa! They charged us 70 Euros to pick us up. When we left, we booked our own transfer for 45 Euros. The view and grounds were amazing. We were 3 couples staying in a 3 bedroom villa - one room being a loft that you accessed by ladder which surprised us. The other 2 in the basement, one of which smelled of sewage. The villa was roomy and the grounds were immaculate and spacious overlooking the sea. However, we were left with a bad taste when we were threatened with a 250 Euro damage charge. Staff had come into the villa while we were out and took pictures. The outdoor furniture is made of wooden frames and wheels that had obviously dried out due to weathering and age. When we attempted to move 2 of these lawn chairs, half of one of the…"
3575,"I stayed in the new North wing, which seems to be poorly designed and constructed.  I could not open the curtain in my room, because it looked right into other hotel rooms, about ten meters away; and could hear other customers walking and talking in the corridor through the thin walls. Then there were a myriad of small defects - unevenly hung TV;  curtain in the shower so long, I was standing on it; the toilet that was leaking water for 2-4 minutes after it was flushed; and a fridge so filled with mini-bar items, that barely anything else fit in it.  After staying at Rennaissance Blu hotels in Tallinn and Vilnius, I was looking forward to a smoked fish included in the buffett breakfast.  It's not included here."
3576,"I stayed for one week at this hotel for business.  I usually stay at the Renaissance hotel when in Sao Paulo but wanted to try something else.  Overall I was dissatisfied with my stay and will probably not go back. It all started when the receptionist told me that the room was not available when I arrived early in the morning, but then told me I could get it if I paid for an extra night. I was confused by the whole situation.  Since the room was available, I asked if I could get a complimentary early check in and also pointed out that, if that was not possible, I had been offered a half day rate via email anyway.  He ignored this.  After insisting and seriously contemplating moving to the Renaissance, a room was offered to me and I was told the early check in would be…"
3577,We decided to stay in this hotel to attend a feiends wedding after reading all the good reviews and 5 star rating of the hotel but we were dissappointed with the overall experience. The rooms were mediocre. We had called up room service for an ironbox which took a long time to come. We tried out the spa which was just ok. We wanted to use the rooftop swimming pool but since there was a corporate party on the same day the pool was fully occupied and it was very noisy. We went back to our room and later at night we went to dine at the restaurant downstairs near the lobby. The restaurant played very loud music (somebody was singing) which gave us a headache. We requested to lower the volume but was in vain. The morning breakfast was also not that great. Overall dissapointed with…
3578,Clean and Nice room Very cold in lobby area and restaurant  Bar was closed upon arrival 22 o'clock  Breakfast under average Personnel in restaurant could not speak English  I tried to order a cappuccino for breakfast with poor result. Cannot recommend this hotel 
3579,"The hotel is located near the centre of Berlin. The staff of the Hotel is friendly and helpfull. The rooms were nice and comfortable. I've been there for a citytrip, so I didn't need a lot of luxury. For my stay, it was an excellent hotel."
3580,"I stayed in a small double on my own while attending a conference recently, and I can't really fault the Ruc. The bed was comfortable, the air con worked well, it's in a good location, the room was quiet (no thumping doors or clanking lift noises) and big enough for one person to come back and unwind. It was ideal and - apart from the fact that there was nowhere to hang the shower head - it's quite happily a four star place for the money.  But I've given it five because the people running it were so lovely, they made the experience of coming in, going out, and being late for breakfast a particularly warm and welcome one. Definitely recommended."
3581,"I recently had to stay over in the LA area over the weekend.  I was traveling by myself and I stayed at this hotel.  I knew it wasn't going to be the poshest of accomodations when I booked through Hotels so I wasn't too upset when I got to my room.  I had asked for a non-smoking room but the room reeked of stale smoke (esp. the bathroom).  Someone had carved grafitti into the inside of the door and the screens on my window were broken.  THere were stains on the cieling and obvious red wine stains scrubbed out of the bathroom counter.  The linen really stank of cigerette smoke as well and the bed was pretty stiff.  I was a bit nervous by the neighborhood, but basically it was a quiet night and no one bothered me.  I got into my hotel at midnight.  There was a security staff…"
3582,"Picked this hotel because it was close to the office. Rooms are decent, but not very clean. There were hairs in the shower, ugh. And you could hear everything in the adjacent room. The tower bar serves its last drink at 22:30, which in my opinion is a bit early for a bar. But the price is cheap and the breakfast is good."
3583,"Was extremely disappointed in this hotel.   Overly pretentious in their idea of what constitutes a 5 star and disorganized.  First off, after having paid fully for our stay in December the year before, booking a suite, we arrived to find out that the ""computer"" made an error and there were no suites available.  Big flurry behind the desk and the desk manager comes out and apologizes many, many times, again citing a ""computer"" error and offers us 1/2 off lunches and dinner with drinks as a compensation.  Which means we would have to eat every meal at the hotel to recompense.  Since the family reason for our visit was in town and we wanted to experience something other than just hotel food, this was unsatisfactory.  But no budging in the offer.   Then we are given an inferior room…"
3584,"This was the worst and unfortunately most expensive hotel that we stayed in during our recent road trip around California. We chose to stay here due to the free parking (rare in San Francisco!) but the area is so dodgy ad feels so unsafe that I would have gladly paid more the stay in a different part of town. We were told as we checked in not to leave any valuables on show in our car so break in are clearly not uncommon - - unsurprising as it's no exaggeration to say that there are drug dealers and homeless people LITERALLY outside the door to the hotel, we didn't feel safe at all. In terms of our room - it STANK of smoke, was noisy, dirty and the beds were rock hard so we barely slept. DO NOT STAY HERE!! I can't emphasise that enough!! I wish we could give this place zero stars!"
3587,I usually don’t review a lot but staying here was a really disappointing experience. We booked two rooms but at 4:30 (check in is at 4) we were told only one room was ready and it could be another hour.  The front desk lady was very rude and not understanding about the fact that we needed to get ready for our dinner reservations.   Do not recommend staying here!
3588,"The cozy feeling you get as soon as you enter the hotel lobby is in itself heart-warming. The welcome is very warm and full of the traditional French politeness. The location of the hotel is superb, there are 2 metro stations at 6 minutes of walk and The Arc de Triomphe at 10. Just a short walk further is the Eiffel. We stayed in the junior suite. The room is extremely well designed and make you feel at home in a traditional victorio-modern theme. The best feature of the room is lovely French balcony. To just hang-out in the balcony with your love and a bottle of wine on a lazy summer night is an experience that we will never forget. The night-time manager at the hotel was so cordial as to even cater to our rather eccentric request for a platter of Cheese to go with our wine…"
3589,"Stayed here for a week with the family. Having stayed in lots of 5 star hotels across the world, it's fair to benchmark the vidamar with those, and it ranks behind. The biggest thing you notice is a lack of leadership, service and atmosphere. The staff are competent but not friendly, and there isn't a huge amount of pace. When you look for the centre of the hotel, or the hub of activity, there isn't one. It's clinical. Pools are nice and views are amazing, but in 7 days we never got asked if we wanted a drink once at the pool. We always had to go ourselves. On a positive, there isn't a fight for sunbeds, in fact it was very quiet. Breakfast was nice, but waited 5 mins for bread to toast this morning, which is basic stuff. We were on half board but only had dinner in the hotel…"
3590,"The wifi is spotty and not reliable, I stayed here on a business trip, so having intermittent internet access in unfavorable. The room was a nice size, clean bed and linens.  The rest of the room was not very clean, as though the staff had just been quickly turning over the rooms and not being thorough and the bathroom definitely needs some renovation.  The shower did not properly drain, there is an old smell to it, as well as water damage that looks like there could be mold.  I also opened the curtains and there was snack food visibly in the cracks of the carpet.  Also opening the curtains to a cloud of dust."
3591,I chose to book this hotel for a friends retreat. Blocked multiple rooms and due to a couple rooms within the block being noisy. The unprofessional and inadequate management order the entire floor to vacate the premises because they were not competent enough to decipher which rooms were loud. The front desk staff including the managers were rude the group. Not to mention the quality of the rooms and hotel itself were quite lackluster. I will say the best part was the Bar Louie and the Free Parking. I would never stay here again nor recommend it to anyone I know. I guess you do get what you pay for. The star rating should be a 2.
3592,"The third year in a row, we stayed at The Weinmeister Berlin. The whole teams loves being there, because the location is perfect, public transport close by and the team at the hotel is just amazing. Every request we had was fulfilled as every year! The rooms are really nice and if you like Art, this is the perfect hotel to stay. we will be staying again in 2019 and thank the team for their continued great service!"
3593,"We stayed 3 nights and loved the boutique feeling of this small hotel. The room was larger than expected (room 24) the bed was four Seasons quality with a soft comforter and lots of pillows it made the room. The bedroom had 2 large windows that brought in a lot of light - the only bad side was it was hard to get the curtains to block out all the light at night & the carpets need to be replaced.The closet was huge. The dining room for breakfast felt like a large atrium and was a beautiful place to start the day. They have a breakfast buffet but we ordered off the menu. I chose the hotel for location. None of the drivers knew where it was, so take a pic of the address to show the taxi driver. It was within 10 minutes to the Eiffel Tower & even closer to L’Arc De Triumph. You can…"
3594,Hotel was clean & modern. Room was lovely but we found it a bit odd that the shower & sink were in the main room only the toilet was separate. Really enjoyed our stay the staff were lovely & really helpful. They provided us with maps & tickets for the hop on hop off bus. The tube station is only a few minutes walk from the hotel. Also we asked for extra pillows after our first night and they were there by the time we returned that evening. We didn’t try the breakfast but it looked very nice. Hotel bar was great too & reasonably priced. We will stay again on when we come back to Berlin.
3596,"Stayed here for 4 days bed and breakfast in September. Lovely hotel, the staff are very nice and helpful. The breakfast was nice. Yes, there is a tram outside but we were so tired from sightseeing all day we hardly heard it. The hotel is nice and central and some lovely authentic bars nearby. The beds were comfortable and the place was clean. The wifi was good. Would use again if we came back to Berlin"
3597,"Whilst very clean the rooms are very small. Only 1 bedside lamp & table, 1 indoor chair & 1 outdoor chair on the tiny balcony which overlooked ugly buildings. Good location close to shops & restaurants. The pool was very small & too noisy to sit for very long. Advertised in house safe but our room didn't have one."
3598,"apart from the location, this has been a dreadful experience.  The staff are unfriendly, the room smells of vomit and there is no chance of sleep in the noisiest room I have ever encountered. (356). We were booked in for one night, going away for a night in yosemite, then returning for three nights.  They would not store our luggage for us for this one night and could offer no suggestions for assistance.  When we returned there was not even a welcoming smile from the check in desk......yet it is a full hotel!  They have a very expensive deli/ restaurant...which has been empty each night (must be some reason for that!).  When we mentioned our problems to other local people in yosemite, they said locals wouldn't touch it...use the Marriott instead. We will."
3599,"This hotel is perfect. Great location, less than one minute walk to train station, best breakfast in Paris, super friendly staff, good WiFi, rooms are very roomy and comfortable I wish I can give this hotel 10 stars."
3600,"The hotel is cheap, its in need of many repairs, the WiFi in ALL areas of the hotel averages at 2kbs per second (think 3 minutes to load Facebook). The restaurant next door is overpriced and uses meat as a garnish to its dishes..  The breakfast is a limited choice of lukewarm scrambled eggs and sausages.. If you rise after 9:30am slim pickings  There is a bus service hourly to the town, be carful to read the right timetable its different in winter and summer. Its a 20 minute brisk walk into town.. Mostly up hill..  The beach is beautiful, bit prickly sand.  All in all, as I said, its cheap, the staff are friendly, its very 70s Costa del Sol.. "
3601,"Staying her at the moment as it’s my husbands birthday  We arrived at 11am as it was an early flight from Dublin and were greeted with a glass of port and a custard pastry  We were told the room wasn’t available until 3pm  So we went sight seeing and caught the tram up the sea front as. My husbands back was really giving him problems we needed a place to sit/rest. So we returned to hotel and had lunch at 2pm.  I tried to see if room was free - no joy.  I was told again that check in was 3pm There was no flexibility around this  The chairs in restaurant are so hard - seems to be hard chairs everywhere in Porto  At 3pm we got the key to our room   Despite requesting a high room, a quiet room as this was recommended all my requests fell on deaf ears   We got a room on level 1 that…"
3602,"Great value for the money. Rooms not expansive but adequate. Comfortable bedding. Clean and modern rooms in classic style. Updated, modern bathrooms - well furbished. Excellent continental breakfast with fresh juice. Only coffee is slightly lacking. Front desk staff is consistently obliging and warm. The location cannot be beat. St Germain is wonderful: lively with some sophistication and not too loud at night. EZ to walk to so many sights. Luxembourg Gardens and Montparnasse 15-30 minute walk. Great shopping and restaurants close by. Wil be coming back for sure. Small small criticism: would be to make sure housekeeping pays more attention to bathroom floor cleanliness between guests. Otherwise, rooms spotless."
3603,"Apparently my room had a ""plumbing issue"" and was not available.  I'm pretty sure they just oversold the hotel. They booked me a room at a hotel I never would have chosen that I did not enjoy. It completely through off my schedule for the night because I had to switch hotels and I had to miss an event I was scheduled to go to that night."
3604,Easy to get metro st Near center of city  Cozy room and very kind staff and safe!  But weekend was noisy  if you want to stay quiet place . .  カタルーニャ駅から15分くらい(空港シャトルバス乗り場) スタバまで5分 バー、レストランが周りにたくさんあります。お店ごとのタパス楽しめます。  
3606,"The hotel has a nightclub on the 4th floor that thumps the bass until early in the morning. Our room was on the 6th floor & we could not fall asleep until they closed the club, sometime around 2am.  Our stay was Wednesday through Saturday.  We complained & requested to be moved but our request could not be accommodated.  They also automatically charge your card $100 per night for incidentals.  The refund takes 3-5 days."
3607,"We stay at the Ibis Saldanha for two nights in September. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the location of the hotel is excellent. The restaurant meals are also OK and so is the breakfast. However, we did find the bathroom dangerously slippery and very prone to accidents. This was so as it was difficult to shower without water being spilled to the bathroom floor, the walk-in shower not having any rail or handle to provide any support and no anti-slipppery mat being provided. "
3608,"After a long journey, we were greeted by a friendly staff member who appointed us to the incorrect room twice, the third time we were lucky to walk in to the room which met the description of our reservation. Not an easy and or pleasant task if there is only one staff member on duty, doing check-ins, answering phone calls, dealing with other guests and serving dinner and drinks. There is no coffee/tea facility in the room, bathroom is cramped, hot water supply is inconsistent, and service is slow. The paperless environment is, according to me, not contributing towards a pleasant stay as staff members on duty are extremely limited, hence the slow service and lack of enthusiasm in sharing tourism information."
3609,"We got there late at night. Parking wasn't good. The bathroon toilet was stopped up. Pull down sheet that had hair and stain. Manager said we could move next door. Pulled down the seets stain and hair, pulled off sheets and the pad was all full of stains and a Dorita chip. We were in our pj because we were tired and wanted to go to bed. Te manager seemed put out to give us third room ,so we said just bring us clean sheets and plunge the toilet. We put so called clean sheets on (thin with hole and some stain). Manager didn't seem to be disturbed about the condition of the room. Very sad.  Didn't have that many bad reviews, but future travler beware. Tried to call Windam customer service ,but only  open 8 to 5.....really stayed at Double Tree the folowing night for about the same price, what a difference.…"
3610,"We stopped there because we had to wait for our connecting flight late at night. Although hotel itself is nice and modern, stuff wasn't very friendly (probably because we are young so they think they don't have to care). Also, bathroom concept is very strange, there is a bathtub in the middle of the room and bathroom is not separated from the room. "
3611,"· This hostel looks more like a hotel. Great service, very clean, spacious rooms with comfortable beds and minifridge, and more than fully equiped kitchen (free popcorn, luxurious coffee and tea!). And all of this with a really nice interior design (the photos are trustworthy). The showers were modern and clean. The provided hairdryers were of great quality. Grocery shop (Lidl) and public transport on walking distance. Highly recommended!  Note: There is nothing separating the shower from the single (!) clothing hook on the door or the floor so make sure you don't splash too much, bring a plastic bag to prevent getting your clothes wet and put down the floor towel after finishing your shower."
3612,"I can definitely recommend this hotel as a great place to stay in Berlin It’s is located very close to Checkpoint Charlie, The Brandenburg and The Reichstag.  The Stadmitte Subway station is a very short walk away. The staff are very professional, efficient and friendly. The hotel is very clean and the bedrooms are a good size with great showers. We didn’t eat at hotel but the drink prices in the bar quite reasonable for a hotel  "
3613,"Considering that the Marriott City Centre has an impeccable location and pretty much the highest rating on Marriott’s website, I decided to try it out. And oh boy, I did not like my experience.  I did my mobile check-in to avoid the line-up, and ended up getting stuck for even longer at the front desk because I had to wait for someone to attend the mobile check in line. The girl who eventually checked me in seemed bothered, rushed the process and assigned me to a TINY room in the corner with half of the window blocked off. I was staying for just the night so didn’t bother switching, but I thought even without an upgrade I shouldn’t get a room of this quality as a Platinum member. I then proceeded downstairs to meet my business partner, who told me he was “scolded” by security…"
3614,"Stayed here for a few days, lovely boutique hotel nicely situated near Monmarte and the Moulin Rouge. Metro within easy walking distance. Continental breakfast included. Friendly helpful staff.  Would definitely recommend "
3615,"If I were a bro in college, I might have loved this hotel. As it is, I am part of a retired married couple. I was not amused. The bed was shoved up against the wall, making it hard to get out in the middle of the night. I have never needed a basketball hoop in my hotel room before, and did not need the one provided here. Very noisy room, right behind the check-in desk and hold luggage area. Very loud people around us. Location was good but I would have traded it for a good night's sleep. We were at the end of 2 week's worth of traveling. Might be good for another time, another kind of person. Not for us."
3616,Good location and free Wifi however the rest of our experience was very poor. The hotel had construction going on across all floors which wasn't mentioned on arrival and the noise in the mornings was unbearable. So much so we left a day early! Mentioned this to the reception staff but they weren't bothered. Also don't use their laundry service.. After calling twice I waiting till the following day to discover on departure it hadn't been done and no apology given. Won't be back as I'm sure there are better hotels in the area. 
3617,"Fantastic location with easy walking access (sunny) or subway access (not sunny) to pretty much anywhere.  Was here both times for the Berlin marathon and it really is ideal for that purpose.  About 1 mile from the start/finish or 2 subway stops.  Comfortable, standard, international Hilton."
3618,"We arrived on 5 September for a 10 day stay.  We were given an apartment room 107 in the oldest block which had a blocked in balcony and only got the sun about 4.30pm.  We did ask to change room the following day and were told there was none available.  I asked if we could at least have a full sized table for the balcony instead of the foot stool we had, bloke didn't seem interested said he would speak to housekeeping needless to say we never got it.  The apartment was a good size but the bathroom needs ripping out and replacing it was so old fashioned.  The teacups and  teaspoons were like doll sized two sips of tea and it was gone.  There are no wine glasses in the room only tumblers The cleaning of the room was very basic.  There is no iron or ironing board in the room.  I…"
3620,"We stayed here on a 4 night break. Great location. Close to train station , tour buses and underground. We stayed on a room only basis which was great. Starbucks around every corner for breakfast and Lidl around the corner for snacks and cheap alcohol for the room!!! We would certainly stay here again "
3621,Lovely hotel maybe slightly worn but we were not in Berlin to stay in at our room and triple check the corners of our lovely corner room with a good view!  The staff was so extremely friendly at the reception! A big thanks to both of the boys there! My boyfriend ended up sick and they were so helpful and understanding during the stay! Only but was the breakfast which could be updated a bit but there's a great baker around the corner with extremely good pretzels and fresh coffee ;)  Would love to stay there again next time Berlin is calling! 
3622,"Only good thing is location, which is great, next to ipanema beach. Other than this rooms don't have a lot of furniture and it is pretty old. Many things broken / worn off, etc. Sand on the floor in the room (they don't vacuum so there is always sand remaining), dust on the shelves. Toilettes were cloaged (however fixed rapidly when asked). Wifi is not free (unless you go to lobby or last floor), and morover exessively expensive (25USD/day ???) and not working well. Restaurant is of very poor quality, service very slow, and really insisting to get tips (will repeat loudly 10 times ""service not included sir"" even if you don't want to give as service is poor). Better to avoid this restaurant and go outside. There is a swimming pool on the roof, but small (like a big bathtub).…"
3623,"The hotel was renovated about 2 years ago- it is still fresh and very clean. Double room ""plus"" type: very spacious, very quiet at night, comfy big bed. Breakfast hall is pretty and welcoming, and breakfast itself very tasty, fresh with a good choice of everything. Wi-fi works good.  There is plenty to do in the area nearby; lots of restaurants, best galleries, shops, museums, nightlife - everything you love in Berlin! A tip: booking a room - use a hotel website, they offer a lot of good deals and you can adjust an offer to your needs. I do not know how the hotel can help you if you arrive by car. They advise using the open space parking at Johannis Str.-24 euros/24h. I used it and it was fine- easy access, no problems with places."
3624,"We had a concert to see in Berlin and decided to stay with Capri by Fraser Berlin.  It was my gf’s birthday, and the operation manager and the team members helped me with the surprise.  They put efforts in it and my girlfriend was so happy with the surprise!  The food in their cafe was good, especially the chicken risotto.  We had it for like, four times during our stay ahaha.  The bar staff, cafe staff and front desk staff are all very warming.  Definitely will come back again if we visit Berlin!"
3625,"We stayed in this very well located hotel for 3 days in April 2013. The hotel is very well located, walking distance from all the main turist attractions in Lisboa. The breakfast was, great and staff very friendly. The rooms are modern, although the toilet seat in our room, had sospiciuos stains (which according to the cleaning lady were not removable and due to the fact that they were old...) In a 4* hotel I think this is not acceptable! The room was essential, not sure if it was worth the money paid. There was no room tidyin up in the PM unless specifically requested.   They opened up a new hotel in praça figueira The Beautique Hotel Figueira, a month ago, which also looked very attractive and definitely less expensive although 4*. Also on the hotel web site there is no…"
3626,"So it’s May and since the year has started I have stayed at this hotel 4 times. No more!!! The location is the reason we stay it’s great and right by Michigan Ave.. But the last time we just stayed for my birthday and well my laptop is missing. We figured it out an hour from home and called the hotel. Well it seemed like a big joke to them. I called corporate and they told me they would reach out to general manager. When spoke to the manager (K) she said that this particular group  no longer owns them, lie corporate confirmed. So manager got back to me said he personally look into it. Calls back said neither the cleaning person nor the security has seen it. Well I’m sorry but do you really think the maid is gonna tell you she took it or the security. And this would also be the…"
3627,"The hotel is good, breakfast is good as well, however not having fruit salad or scrambled eggs is surprising. The room is okay. Not a lot of space to hang clothes and smelled a bit funny. In the morning a bit noisy with the cleaning crew vacuuming the other rooms. Overall it's a good enough hotel, although a bit pricey."
3628,"Arrived in Chicago from Europe for one night due to a long layover. Paid $315 for one night, the cost was not the problem. The issue was is the lack of quality this hotel provided for the price. I stayed the two previous nights at the Airport Hilton in Rome for $50 less per, it was a MUCH nicer facility. I’ve stayed at the Grand Hyatt in Houston for a little more than $300 a night, it is a shining example of what a luxury hotel should be. The Ohare Hilton is hands down one of the worst hotels I’ve ever stayed in. An absolute embarrassment to the Hilton brand."
3629,Stayed in 2-1505 suite. This room is in the Tresor Tower. What a disgusting mess. Puke stains on the bathroom walls. Black mold in the showers. More dried on puke in the sink in bathroom. Housekeeping non existent. First day had to call. Second day “ no show “ again. DO NOT STAY HERE. My sister had room a few floors above us. Her room was cleaner and was made up everyday. This place is old and tired  
3630,"I'm afraid I can't share the enthusiasm of some other recent reviewers for this hotel.  True, its location, a restored house at the edge of the old town, is good and strategic. Room 506 provides a nice glimpse of the market buildings, and is quite light. However, even though I had the luxury of single occupancy of a double room, I found it cramped -- like the shower. Annoyingly, an airconditioning light flickers 24/7; the first receptionist said, ""hold the button and it will switch off"" -- quod non; the second laconically offered me a post-it to cover the light.  Breakfast choices are OK, but unimaginative, with the exception of the salads. Worse, though, is that breakfast is served in a dark basement, fitted out in depressingly bad taste. An English-language news channel is…"
3631,"Stayed at this hotel many times over last few years. Service has declined. Hotel under construction   We were not informed . Noise level in our 2 rooms was so loud that conversational speech was impossible.  Sounded like a riveter was going on in the room above us. Complaints to the front desk offered zero solutions. Room temperature miserably hot. Thermostat did not work.  Water pressure in one of our rooms dropped to near zero-my apologies to housekeeping because the toilet did not flush due to the above. The list goes on but enough is enough. We won't be back. Thanks Hilton for making our spring break vacation for our autistic son so ""memorable"""
3632,"The kettle , cup in bedroom is so dirty.  And about sewage pipe block in toilet. Can't enjoy take a shower.  Call services room to repair sewage pipe need 20 minutes  can coming.  I'm not happy about  this case.  Breakfast is not bad . The food taste is good ."
3635,I so enjoyed staying at Hotel Quintinie. The staff was warm and welcoming from the minute we stepped in. The room was just as beautiful as it appeared online. I would 100% stay here again. It was the perfect hotel for a girl’s trip. 
3636,"Before today I was completely happy about staying at the Harbor Court Hotel, that was, until I saw a $1,400 charge on my credit card bill that I did not authorize nor was i told about, a month after I stayed. During my stay there was days where the elevator was out of order, and one night after a long day, my hotel key card just randomly stopped working.   Thankfully they are refunding my money, but I still need to know why they went against their hotel private policy (on their website) and went ahead and charged that large sum of money to my personal credit card without even an ounce of notice. Their private policy on their website says ""We take the utmost care to ensure that the personal information we obtain from you is not used in a way that you may be unaware of or not…"
3637,"Was there early January and had the dinner buffet ,  it was mediocre at best . Selection was somewhat poor and definitely quite limited and the quality was so-so on most dishes. Not in the same league as other Shang buffets in Asia . I definitely wont be going back to THIS Shang !"
3638,"Good: Staff/ Management/ Food/ Cleaning department. Everyone spoke perfect English ; moreover, extremely helpful. ( felt welcomed.)  Bad: Rooms were small and cheap. Bathrooms were a joke. ( bright yellow coating to save money) Carpet was green and disgusting. Pool was extremely cold, and small. Not sure why Ronaldo would put his name on this hotel ; however, regardless of what staff says he would never stay here... ( unless he was forced.)  Overall, if you value good service/ friendly staff with a mediocre hotel this is your place. In the United States it would be comparable to a motel 6. ( may be an insult to hotel 6.) "
3639,"Everything was just perfect! Very charming and cozy hotel. Beautiful decor, very clean, comfortable beds and pleasant, helpful staff. Good and tasty breakfast. Right next to a metro station. It's just a great place! We wish we could have stayed longer! Thank you for making our first time in Paris so pleasant!"
3640,"I stayed at the hotel for a trade fair held near the airport last month.  I wasn't sure about the property but had no choice because all my clients stayed there and I had to be around throughout the event.  The team at the front desk was efficient and professional, which made me feel much more comfortable in the beginning of the stay.  However...   I dropped my stuff and left my room immediately for work.  After a long day, went back to my room and all I wanted was a can of soda.  I took one out from the mini bar and the can was scarily filthy.  Forget about the drink so I just took a shower and went to bed.  The moment I moved my pillows, another surprise - a condom packet!  Ok, it's just a packet but tell me, if the sheet and bedding was ever properly changed, would it be…"
3641,"I like the Adina Hotel product line and have stayed in several in Germany. The one in Mitte has everything I need. It is close to the main train station (10 min walk). I usually get a suite which includes a washer and dryer, kitchen, balcony, etc. It is a fully-functional apt. The breakfast in cafeteria style (get a tray and help yourself) and the offerings are plentiful. There is a pool and fitness center on ground floor. Most of the time it is empty. On my most recent trip, two people at the front desk, Sofia Bianchi and Andre Anglin, provided superlative service. They are customer-service oriented and care deeply about ensuring that guests have a pleasant stay. I hope that the managers appreciate their service. Generally, the hotel is fairly priced (although, because of a…"
3642,"This used to be a great hotel.  The service was great and it was very reasonable. The key word here is ""was."" this last stay was HORRIBLE. first, our group was promised free breakfast since we booked with them. When we checked in we were told that this was not possible. Next, there was no hot water. I mean, we are not talking a third world hostel here but there was seriously no hot water. When we got back from a long day on the town our rooms were not made up. Even though we requested them to make them up and were promised that they would do so. After many excuses we were finally told that house keeping went home. This was by far the worst experience I have ever had at a brand you are supposed to be able to trust. "
3643,"Our check-in was great, but that was it.  We were not told about the fire training drill the following day nor was there a letter in our room the manager later told us all guests received.  We understand public safety but after the initial 9:00 a.m. fire bells, Xmas music was blasted into our room at the highest volume imaginable!!!  I called to ask how long the ear-shattering music would last and was told the training would go on until 5:00 p.m.  After a few minutes break, the overwhelming music resumed and I called again.  I could not even hear the voice on the other end due to the decibel level in our room.  The housekeeper left a note stating they respected our 'do not disturb' sign and we should call when we wanted towels, etc.  No one answered the housekeeping line.  Then…"
3644,"Hotel is in an excellent location for exploring the inner city of Berlin. Lots a restaurants, bars , etc. Unfortunately many are the regular tourist traps and the standard of food and service is average at best - not the hotels fault! Rooms were clean, tidy and we had a view with river glimpses. Service was very good and they had some nice touches such as water and sweets available as you left the foyer."
3645,"Service was ordinary and I felt like just a number. No real greetings or any special treatment. Even when I mentioned I wanted to go to the airport at 3am, I had to suggest that they call a taxi for me! The room was nice and good value for money. The food offered in the cafeteria was above average and had a suprising array of food. This hotel is right next to the subway, so you should have no problem getting around."
3646,"Sickening smell of their cats in the main hall. Cats exactly on the kitchen worktops,and the sweet little dog that can not help but to lick the kitchen counter. Are there never napkins at meals? Too much work for a single person! Lorena yes...very available but...? Too much work for a single person! Breakfast .... normal, as however by Supermarket. A little more light outside doesn't hurt either with the possibility to turn it on, and be out in the open even at night. A lot of will of the owner. A sincere kiss to Lorena who works too; but a sincere kiss and not a kiss of Judas. For improving. But already She is improving."
3647,"This is a beautiful modern apartment in a fascinating part of town, with great transport links, and an easy walk to the Mauerpark. There are plenty of cafes, restaurants and shops nearby.  The apartment itself is beautiful, with a modern industrial feel. While I was there, there was some building work going on in the common parts, but it didn't affect the stay at all. "
3648,"Allthough the building is nice outside, it have nice views and atonishing reception hall, the hotel is not at a asian luxury level.  The rooms are only two years old and look old, rooms are small and it was impossible to open  both luggage at the same time. The staff is friendly but not effecitive. The situation is nice for the views but far away from city center sometimes is impossible to reach it due to traffic jams. It was really a deception."
3649,"It is a standard hotel of a higher quality, rooms are clean and well kept. The underground station is only two blocks away, which is very convenient. Unless you have the breakfast included in your room price, don't bother with it. 17 EUR for something you can get for 5 just across the street in a bakery on your way to the subway."
3650,Great value for the money. Not the most central location but close to everything you need and you could easily take the public transport in to all the views. Fridge or watercooker would have been nice in the Room. Friendly staff. Rooms maybe not the most soundproof but we survived. 
3653,"I booked two rooms at this Marriott and specifically added the secondary guest's name on my reservation as they would be checking in early. When they arrived, they were treated rudely and had trouble getting in. That was just the beginning. There is only valet parking at the hotel ($50+ dollars a night), and we followed the instructions to give them our car. A few days later, we received a City of San Francisco citation! The Valet had our vehicle at this time. I have been calling the hotel multiple times, and while management says they will investigate, they haven't done a thing. We're left paying the $110 fine, for which we were not responsible. Further, when I called the hotel last, I was hung up on three times, and the fourth time, when I called the front desk out on it, they…"
3654,"Management refused to honour the red 30% discount sign by the entrance. I was told it would be taken down. I doubt this will ever happen. I was told they are too busy to take it down. The shower gets cold quickly, and there is a large intrusive wooden storage box above the mattress. If you are a few minutes late for the free breakfast that ends at 10am, expect to be charged if you still want it. It shouldn’t be hard to find something better in this city. Otherwise this was a great place! "
3655,"For some reason the room prices were high for the days we were there; we paid £200+ for each of the 4 nights.  The hotel is big, well located and appeared to be very full.  The staff were courteous but not that friendly.  The beds and bedroom were very good, but why such a small bathroom?  As we age, we find it difficult to climb into the shower, sited at the end of the bath.  Apparently all rooms are equipped this way - time to modernise to shower only?  Breakfast was acceptable although somewhat chaotic."
3656,"Worst check in and out I’ve ever experienced.  Really unhelpful concierge and management.  This hotel has a great view of the bund and well designed room but little dated. Some of buttons in the room weren’t functioning.  Comparing this hotel to other Hyatt hotels I stayed in past, it’s hard to believe this hotel is in the same Hyatt chain. They should do better especially in service."
3657,"My 18-year-old daughter and I stayed for six nights in this charming little hotel and were extremely pleased with our choice. The room was small but nicely organized and perfectly adequate for the two of us. The decor was lovely, the room was spotlessly clean, and the air-conditioning was absolutely marvellous (40 degrees outside!). Twin beds were very comfortable with good quality linens. Breakfasts were perfect... fresh and crispy baguettes and croissants, and all sorts of little goodies to go with them, and fantastic tea and coffee. The staff were ever-present and helpful, providing directions, ordering a taxi to the airport, providing ice etc. The only negative point (and it was minor) was that our bar fridge gave up the battle with the heat and became a warm cupboard.  The…"
3658,"I and my wife had stayed there for 5 days, and every morning there were fresh breakfast hot coffee and cold juice and of course good service. The room was big enough for us when we were using it for baths and sleeping, and the service is excellent. The Metro station Dumnesnil is only 1 minute away and has 2 lines, which is very good. We have used this hotel 2 times already and will use it again, next time we are in Paris. Family Borch, Copenhagen "
3659,"Hotel in the center of Amsterdam, near tram line Not a big fan of the shower, you can't use the shower head properly The bed was too bouncy and small The insulation was not terrible, we heard the next rooms"
3660,Unbelievable experience  there were ants in the room. These were not taken care of then my clothes and belongings were removed and lost.  For a new hotel the staff hasn't been trained and doesn't have a clue. They told me they were going to have the manager contact me but in the three days there they never did 
3661,"The room service prawn pizza i ordered is the sort of cheap pizza I might expect from a chain pizza store, although they would normally use something other than really small canned or frozen miniature prawns"
3662,"Only in Barca for one evening before a cruise so picked a hotel close to the city and port. Clean rooms with good sized sofa bed, cool rooftop bar and even complimentary champers in reception. only down point would be a dodgy lift"
3663,"Bad experience to stay here. Firstly,staff do not understand and speak english, we could not able to ask more information about the tours. Amd the electric power shut down and no one inform whether we are safe to stay in the room, we take own stairs to go down lobby and staff act nothing until we asked whether it done or not.  The breakfast are oily and the restuarant are not clean."
3664,"A friend recommended this place and I was very happy. Hotel has a lovely atmosphere, is easy to find being close to the subway and the room was small but very clean and modern with excellent air conditioning. The best thing about this place is the staff. I found them extremely helpful, friendly and full of suggestions. Would definitely stay here again and would recommend it highly. "
3665,"This is not a grand hotel but a small intimate one in an excellent spot for walking around Paris, fiinding a restaurant and visiting the Louvre. The service was impeccable, my room was full of character and I cannot recommend La Crayon enough if you have a short stay in Paris and want to be in the centre of things. The hotel is on a quiet street and was perfect for my stay."
3666,"The Phileas is the ideal combination of a stylish hotel in a great location.  David at the front desk is a huge asset to the hotel, friendly and very knowledgeable.  The rooms are great  and the breakfast, a great choice of really good food.  Based here you are only a couple of minutes from the great department stores, the Opera and The Madeline.  Would definitely stay here again "
3667,"The bad:  I had a single room that had a cot-like sized twin bed, with springs that poke into as you sleep...so I slept on the bed covers, which I didn’t need anyway as the room was like an oven! The base of the shower stall was not sealed properly and I needed to use two towels to prevent the water from covering the bathroom floor. The carpet in the room was old, stained and suspiciously dirty looking...so I wore socks as a protection (not what I wanted, as I was already overheated and dripping with sweat, even with the portable fan in the room).    The good:  Breakfast had some good, fresh offerings...including delicious fish.  The housekeeper for my room clearly did a fine job despite the less that desirable conditions she had to work with.  The front desk staff were helpful…"
3668,"- We didnt have city view, the wastebasket was too small and there were only two towels (for 2 people) instead of 4 (for hair) and there were no amenities. + The best things were the 24h hot water and the shower generally, the decoration with the mirrors and the big TV, very nice location near to metro/bus station and supermarket."
3669,Our very first trip to Germany for a concert. On arrival at the hotel. We were greeted at reception by a very professional and helpful receptionist. The room and bathroom were very clean and well presented. Breakfast was very adequate and the staff very pleasant and polite.The hotel is set in a quiet residential area. To get to the nearest main area for shops it takes about 15-20 minutes to walk. The city itself is wonderful and is very interesting. We did the open bus tour to get a feel for the city and also to get an idea of the size of the place. Unfortunately the concert we attended at the Max Schmelling-Halle was on the other side of the city but the underground system is excellent.
3670,"Very disappointing. Excellent location, awful rooms. No air conditioning, small room, uncomfortable bed, terrible noise outside until 3 in the morning and you had to keep the windows open. Not even a screen on the window. Dark, dank. Go elsewhere. Thought it would be romantic, but was wrong."
3671,"Average hotel, small rooms, cleanliness needs improvement but generally did the job. Nothing to praise but not much to complain about either. Decent. Hote Prices in Amsterdam going up by a lot! The surround area is quite bare not much going on. By the river so beautiful views."
3673,"Location is perfect.  We were delighted to be shown a room, arriving around 11am. We chose Santa Justa Hotel as it advertises completely sound proofed rooms. We'd requested a QUIET room and were given an attic room next to the noisy beeping elevator. We returned to the front desk explaining we'd rather leave our luggage and return later for a quiet room. We were offered a slightly musty but quiet room next to the staircase and the cheerful housekeeper changed the sheets to make two twin beds while we were out. In Lisbon, it rains at night, and we woke up to the sound of rain pounding down on the metal(?) roof. It was like being in an aluminum garden shed during a downpour. We could hear the occasional siren as well. Otherwise it is clean, modern, strong wifi, a safe and offers a…"
3674,A lovely hotel if you get Zoo view rooms. Expensive but great for special occasions. Spa and pool lovely but treatments expensive. All the extras also expensive which is a shame. Staff amazing. Food very good but a bit too fussy for my husband. Nice but expensive breakfast. A walk to public transport but good options nearby. No nearby cafe / restaurant nightlife if that's what you are after. Wonderful to be by the park and zoo for us.
3675,"Even my stay was for one night but I found this hotel is a nice clean big hotel. Location is great, public transport of all kind just in 3-5 minutes walk. Not far from the city center. Rooms are big and clean! We had everything we needed for good trip."
3676,"Charming, elegant hotel.   Reception staff absolutely charming.   Room on third floor was really quiet, well furnished and spotlessly clean. Thick carpeting in passageways kept noise down.  Would certainly stay here again"
3677,"My husband I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights about 2 weeks ago.  When booking our honeymoon, we were torn between spending time in Oia or Imerovigli, so we compromised and stayed here for 3 nights, and then another hotel our last 3 nights.  I fell in love with this property online for it's views, and it does not disappoint.  Yes, there are a lot of stairs involved, but most reviews mention that and prepare you for it.  Our ferry to Santorini from Mykonos was almost 2 hours late, so by the time we arrived it was sunset, aka packed with tourists.  The hotel sent someone to meet us by the post office to help with our bags, and he was just amazing!  He threw our bags over his shoulder and lead the way, clearing people out of our way and making sure we didn't get lost in the…"
3678,"This is our first experience with a 5* hotel. We had some high expectations, but we are a bit disappointed.  Checkin was verry rushed. We got some drinks but we did not get the change to drink it. We where rushed to the service desk.  Nice room, but for a 5* hotel we expected the finishing touch details would be outstanding. Unfortunately if you look to the cabinet doors on the room (3105) they would not close, unless if you would wiggle it a bit ore lift the doors with two hands. The entrance door in the shower blocks the toilet, a sliding door build/hide in the wall would be better. You wil get a better walking space and more space in the bathroom.  If you rent a studio with kitchen there is NOTHING to use. There are no plates, no spoons, no knifes, no forks, not even one pan.…"
3679,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for two nights during our trip to Berlin. The staff were friendly, the room was basic, clean and comfortable which is all we really needed as we were just using it as a base to sleep and shower at while we explored the city.   The breakfast was lovely, a wide selection of bread, meats and cheeses, cereals, fruit and yoghurt, with a hot selection as well.   The nearest train station is a 5-10 minute walk and then travel to most parts of the main city took around 20 minutes so be aware of this if you don't want to travel that much! One of the nights we took a taxi back from Mitte and that cost us around 20 euros.   If you want cheap and cheerful, and don't mind the extra travel time to get here, I would definitely recommend staying. "
3681,We are very delighted with every aspect of the outstanding hospitality of the Hotel Esprit Saint Germain.  The entire staff of the hotel go out of their way to make your visit as comfortable as possible.   The concierge Amira was very helpful with suggestions for restaurants and travel arrangements.  The hotel is in a great location in the heart of the city yet is very quiet and we were never disturbed by the traffic in the city streets.  There are many excellent restaurants within a short walking distance that the staff are able to recommend.  The rooms are well appointed and very comfortable.  We would stay at the hotel on any future visits to Paris. 
3682,"Very LOUD.  When you get down to it, you play a hotel for a night's sleep.  When I checked in, I asked for a quiet room and they placed me at the end of the hall.  Starting at 1:00am, trucks were coming down the ally, picking up trash, delivering construction supplies,etc.  This went on for hours.  The room came with ear plugs on the night stand, so they clearly new it was loud.  Either the front desk person didn't know (but there two people checking me in so maybe they both didn't know) or they didn't care.  Very frustrating stay."
3683,"I made a reservation on the phone in order to get a good rate. They charged me at the same cost of a flexible fare, but with a non-flexible fare, which, at the time of our stay, the rate was much lower than what I got (and I was just a couple of days before). They forget about parity fares and will charge you the first night with out possible cancelation. It's a shame. There are better hotels at the same price."
3684,"Wonderful staff, excellent location... we paid a lot for the jacuzzi suite and our jacuzzi was broken at check in... they got it to work the third day, yet we were never offered any kind of credit.  People that work at the pool bar are the best!  They made our stay nicer... room had some stains on the carpet and curtain.. for The price we paid, I expected a cleaner room and a working jacuzzi.  "
3685,"This was my first visit to San Francisco and overall it was excellent. A friend of a friend convinced my wife to reserve this hotel, that it was new and good. I wish I had read the negative tripadvisor reviews prior to booking this place: Positive: location is amazing. It is a walking distance to the market, bars, and nearby shopping areas. We did lots of walking. The rooms are spacious but..... Negative: Upon checking into our ""nice room"", for whatever reason reason, I look at the bed. The first thing that caught my eye were white torn bed linens. But that was nothing compared to human hair on the bed sheets. I'm not just talking about one or two but lots of hair. On our way out for dinner and drinks, I went to lobby and alerted the front desk. The person I spoke to didn't even…"
3686,"We stayed at hotel des arts for my girlfriends birthday. The area is lovely, only a short walk from the sacre coeur and moulin rouge. The hotel was great, offering complimentary drinks between 3pm and 11pm. I had enquired about good places to go for my girlfriends birthday and the staff were quick to reply. Not only this but on our arrival they also gave us some champagne and macarons which was a lovely surprise. Not only this but they also upgraded us to a superior suite. Thank you very very much hotel des arts for a lovely birthday weekend in Paris! "
3687,I believe this hotel is perfectly located. Not too far from Plaza Catalunya... 10 minutes walk... Hotel has amenities that every tourist desire for his comfort considering the price paid. Varied breakfast buffet I recommend this hotel!
3688,"dear all travelling all around the world all the year in nice and good hotels, i did try since more than 3 days to book a single room in thye novotel center norte  hotel in sao paulo  this hotel is not a five star hotel,but just a normal hotel  ok. since 3 days in this NORMAL HOTEL,impossible to get a confirmation and reply on the booking   do you beleive it !? I heard from other people that this hotel has a very bad service inside !! i m not suprise today about this !!  there is many other good hotels in sao paulo, do not go to novotel or good luck for the booking and the rest !!  ciao ff"
3689,"No gym (not conveyed beforehand).  First room was not finished being cleaned.  Second room had mold in the shower.  Third room was fine, but I ultimately ended up spending a good two hours either Channing rooms or waiting to change rooms.  Such a disappointment - my last Swisshôtel experience (Lima) was so wonderful."
3690,"Excellent location, just in front of the s-bahn station, second stop from Brandenburger Tor. On the downside, lack of shelves in the bedroom and in the bathroom that make the bathroom/sleeping room logistics a bit complicate."
3691,"It was the first time that me and my wife been in Paris. I checked to many hotels via tripadvisor comments and then decided to stay at this hotel. Location is perfect. We used RER B from CDG airport to Gare de Nurd and then transfered to metro staion and a few minutes later we arrived to Oberkramf metro station which is near to Hotel. Very easy to find the hotel! Hotel staff are very kind, friendly and lovely. All of the staff are speaking English and always smiles you back :) we stayed at fifth flor, room is a little bit small but there is everything you need. Comfortable bed and pillow, clean and renovated bathroom and hot water. Street is very quite and safe. There are too many cafés around, it is three minutes away from Republike avenue that you can find anything. Price is…"
3692,"I absolutely love this hotel. It is a must in Paris, whether you are with someone or single. Amazing, sexy and eccentric atmosphere. The location is unbelievable and the staff are always very warm and welcoming. Not to mention the decor... I will be coming back to this hotel. I absolutely love it!"
3693,Staying with the Hampton by Hilton was OK - but quite expensive. Rooms are OK but nothing special. Staff was very friendly. Unfortunately during my stay I had issues getting warm water in the shower. Breakfast was quite good.
3694,"Overall a great location with very nice units but the parking lot is a disaster!   If you don't secure a parking spot by early evening you will be forced to circle the block, park illegally and risk getting towed. Cars are parked on garden beds, double parked, blocking vehicles, and along fire lanes....this is a disaster waiting to happen. Adjacent parking lots in the retail area are also off-limits for overnight parking according to the front desk.  I was advised to move my car into a space when a nearby bar closes at 2AM!  I have a parking pass....but not a parking space. So they can take the reservations, they just can't 'hold' the reservation.   I wouldn't stay here again unless I was taking a taxi."
3695,Kind and very helpful staff. Helped us with our entire experience in Paris. Central area close to everything. We loved our stay at Rays it was a serene and comfortable place to stay with our family we will return to stay here again! 
3696,"The service is not good, and considering the price for this place, the service is horrid. At the rates they charge they should really have staff that is educated as well as pleasant to deal with. I have to say that though the accommodations and the location are solid, I would not recommend staying here to anyone. I've had better experience at almost all the Hostels I've stayed at for 1/20th the price."
3697,"I wish i could say it wasn’t, but, honestly ‘average’ is the best it gets from me. Located right on the Stadhouderskade affording an easy walk into the Centruum, the hotel is a fairly ordinary looking building with a somewhat underwhelming and unwelcoming entrance. Reception seems awkwardly laid out and queues of customers obstruct the ingress and egress of residents. Staff seem quite laid back and not really that bothered or positive, one exception was Ivo who was quite pleasant and helped us when we needed it. Our room for 3 was spacious, blandly furnished and tucked at the back in the basement affording nothing more interesting than a windswept courtyard with nothing of any merit in it. Room amenities were standard , certainly not 4*, a noisy small fridge, fairly…"
3701,Good position Fast Wi-Fi  Comfy bed good shower Nice coffee machine  Free safe Thin towels Poor lighting  Cleaning very patchy  Staff good at resolving problems  Amsterdam is a lovely city with good architecture and travel networks
3702,"The staff here are the nicest, so welcoming and helpful. The rooms are lovely, small but lovely. The beds are so comfy! The reason why I gave it only 3 stars because you have to pay for the WiFi, TV and house keeping! It was a little far out but the tram is just right around the corner ! "
3703,We booked a one bedroom Suite on the top floor of the hotel with a view of the Eiffel Tower. Great location close to the Metro. Room amenities were top-notch-- as was the service at the bar/breakfast buffet. Great staff-- very friendly and helpful.
3704,"Arrived late from airport and arrived to a room with two single beds pushed together, when I called reception I was told they are nearly fully booked and then can make it into a double. If there is one thing I hate is beds made into a double.   The hotel ranges from wedding groups, families, corporate conference and couples. This was a bit confusing and couldn't relax.  Breakfast is great but lunch and dinner just not 5 star. €18 sandwich and was heated so break was soggy and chips were cold.   No concierge service. Staff seem frazzled when makes you feel uneasy.   Would I recommend ... no. I would recommend to stay in boutique hotel in central Lisbon and go for day to roof top to relax as pool and gym area good.   Much better food and drinks outside.  One more night left so…"
3706,"Good hotel on the center of Berlin, near everything, (wall, museums, aquarium, Tor, etc.), although it is a normal hotel it looks more like a youth hotel, lots of youg people, a free kitchen to do your own meals, etc. but quiet and with good rooms, not too big but enough and with good bathrooms"
3707,Our initial room that we were booked in was over an area with lots of construction and it was very loud in our room. I went downstairs and they promptly moved us to another room.  There is a free shuttle service that takes you around from train station (easy to get to downtown Berlin) and to airport. The breakfast was good and complimentary. Room services/dinner were a bit overpriced but tasted good. 
3708,Very nice en modern style hotel. Reception was friendly en helpful. Rooms are big and comfortable. Nice desk. Sufficiently comfortable to work at. Bathroom was nice and big as well.  The hotel is on walking distance of some must sees and right by the train station. Breakfast wa delicious with lots of different dishes.  The only thing I missed was some fresh water in the room.  I would certainly recommend the hotel. It has a very reasonable price/quality ratio.
3709,"The hotel is in a good location near the train station and it is clean and tidy but it is very basic. There is no tea or coffee maker, no iron and ironing board, no fridge etc. I normally saw in other hotels I stayed before. The continental breakfast is very basic too. Overall, it's a budget hotel for a short stay. "
3711,"The hotel has a 25 meter swimming pool.  But the pool water quality is terrible--the pool is cloudy, there is a chemical smell in the pool area, there is a dirt line  perimeter has a dirt line around the perimeter,  and, even though the pool is in a beautiful, light filled space, swimming in the pool is problematic."
3712,"We were booked into this hotel for a business meeting and all of us were given rooms with single beds even though we requested doubles / queens. As a female traveller, the location was fine as I had to spend the weekend by myself before my colleauges arrived so being situated near the mall was convenient. The hotel was undergoing renovations so there was construction most of the time and only half the reception was open at a time. This meant that service was slow (leave ample time for checkout). Room service was fast for me but for my colleague, it took over 1.5 hours for his fish (don't order the fish!). I was very disappointed with the cleaniness. I left the room when housekeeping arrived and came back 10 mins later to drop something off. Housekeeping had already left my room!…"
3713,"1. Booked an ocean view room approx 3 months in advance.  2. Hurricane came in created flooding in the ocean view rooms (though apparently not all of them.)  3. As per booking terms, prepaid rate which was charged about 2 weeks before my arrival.  At this point, they knew the damage but I was not contacted about the issue, simply charged the ocean view room.  4. Start receiving pre-arrival SMS texts a few days before arrival. For us international customers, these can mean hefty roaming charges for each text.  5. At checkin, informed they were downgrading me, but I wouldnt be charged the questionable (according to several US states´attorney generals)resort fee and given a $100 hotel credit. I asked about other options and told there were none.   6. More SMS texts asking to rate…"
3714,"My expectations were all met in this hotel. Staff were nice and very helpful until my departure time. Though theres one thing I was not happy about, I had only 1 or 2 signal bar in my roomand maybe it was the location of my room. Internet connection was pretty good. The location of the hotel is very close to everything that you can think of."
3716,"The princess hotel is great value for money, the rooms are clean and tidy and you get bathroom ameneties such as: Shower Gel, Shampoo, toothbrush, toothpaste, shaving creme and razor. There's plenty of towels and robes. The shower sometimes takes a while to get to the right temperature. The lifts can take a while to come but that's to be expected when it's busy in the mornings. The views of Barcelona from the hotel are great and each floor has a glass window where you can see the views too. Room's come with black out blinds and a blind on the glass for bathroom area. There is laundry service but not on the weekends. A spa which I have not used before. The room also comes with a phone operated by a company called Manet which is like a concierge phone for places to visit and eat…"
3717,"Stayed for 2 nights and can't thank my stars that we didn't book for longer.  I know the reviews say the rooms are small but I think it needs to be mentioned that the rooms are so small that the wash basin is IN THE ROOM. The tv is all but hanging from the ceiling.  They provide no water and the sound of the flush can wake you up in the room. Taxis can't access the road in front of the hotel in the day time so you have to drag your luggage to the building.  On top of everything, they had construction on from 8AM and despite requests they didn't stop.  All in all it was quite a traumatic experience specially since we'd travelled a long way to reach SF. Booking a student's hostel may have been more comfortable.   Don't waste your money. Add a couple 100 dollars and book the Hilton…"
3718,"Staff was not friendly in the morning. Always busy with long lines at the desk. The rooms are dark and dinige, nothing as advertised on the website. A bad smell sewerlike came from the bathroom. The sink in the bathroom did not drain properly. Smh"
3719,"Small boutique property with minimal staff and service.  Beautiful view, good location. Service was sub par.  Called 3 times to get the TV fixed to watch world cup final and nothing.  Had to ask to get a shower head installed. Charges for everything. Restaurant extremely overpriced. Wedding one of the days so no access available to anything. Tanning areas were not maintained. Only one chair to sit on patio - how do you eat with a family of 4 for breakfast outside. Not a 4.5 star hotel as recommended.  Prior year stayed in Astra Suites... so much better!"
3720,"Not your usual hotel expectations. Its clean and the Staff are nice enough. Not a fan of toilet in front entrance though and only a curtain dividing the bedroom and bathroom. If you prefer a little privacy going potty, this is not the place for you."
3721,We stayed here on Aug. 10-13 of 2015 and overall were pleased. We picked our keys up at the Short Stay Group desk at the airport and found the place on our own. The apt. was practically new with everything we needed. It was probably a 15 minute walk to the center of town so fairly convenient.  Our only complaint was that it was stuffy and we could not get a breeze in the apt. It was not air conditioned so it was a little warm inside.
3722,"This hotel was an amazing find. Everything about my stay at Hotel District Republique seemed higher than a 2 class designation. The reception was extremely accommodating, responding immediately to any questions or small requests I had. There was a modern elevator right from the entry level floor, and my room was clean and felt more like a luxury hotel. Sure it was small, but this is Paris, and that's how it is! The only things in my room that didn't feel high class were the thin towels and single-ply toilet paper. These are small details, and I only mention them to emphasize how EVERYTHING else was so amazing. This hotel was on par with another 4 star I stayed at in Paris later in my trip. And great location near multiple metro lines, and walking distance to everything downtown.…"
3723,"Our apparatmento was pool side - central strategic position to visit the island - good flat with kitchenette - bathroom with shower fitted with too little tent that will not stick on while you brush - small but nice swimming pool with hydro massage, sin is not you can take advantage because invasion from 17.00 onwards child ... relatives of the owners ... what with their shouting and rudeness literally take possession of the property. Council before booking inquire if children are on vacation or not ... in order to avoid that your relaxation is damaged by their presence ..."
3724,"Love at first sight, we are the usual church-goers you might say and this time we were met by one of the more seasoned staff so the Valmiermuiza came in fast and in the right glasses! I ordered a meal as I was hungry and took in the sun and the presence of my good friend. There were surprisingly few there at this time, end-of-the-day, some Scandinavians and locals, the tattoos were in abundance, as were the ''jihadi-beards'', all must have these days..The beers were good and so were the peanuts, but I noticed that we were all too soon forgotten and a couple next to us had to go in and chase the waitress, maybe due to changing of shifts...anyway all was cleared and we look forward to coming back! -After all, a better location for an international and not too large nor too small,…"
3725,"I am Hilton diamond member and stay at Hilton property every week for the past few months. Often travel on early flight and need early check in and have no issue on any hotels until this one. I use Hilton apps to message hotel to request early check in as usual, however I was told they must charge me $25 for early check in. I can understand that I can’t check in if there is no room available but charge me for early check in is not something happened to me before as none of the Hilton properties charged me on this. I have to continue exchange message to a point I showed my historical early check in and then she said there is no early check in fee for diamond member. Isn’t it I am diamond member and you should know? Isn’t it you should do homework and understand this? After I…"
3727,I stayed here in December of 2014 for two days on christmas eve and the next day while exploring the city and i was very happy with the courteous staff and the helpful I received. Did i mention the amazing breakfast?
3728,"I was about to head to bed when I spotted a black dot on the cover. Picked it up and checked it out, only to find it was a bed bug. Called reception and got moved to a new room, but questionable as to whether the rooms are all clean..."
3729,"This hotel in great need of improvement in all areas. While the room is large and the ocean view is amazing, all the furnitures are dated and uncofortable -- to say the least -- the bathroom looks bad and the corridors are glummy. Check in and check out can take over 10 minutes since there is usually only three people working on the desk and the hotel is huge. Breakfast has lots of food options but the quality is very poor. Surprisingly, room service food is very decent. In my particular case, there was another reason for disliking this property: I was attending a conference at the hotel and the manager refused to extend my check out time in one hour, what led me to miss part of an important delayed presentation to move my bag from the room -- what a lack of courtesy with a…"
3730,"Location is great Hostel is clean and spacious common place Great value for money  Clean rooms and bathrooms  —— Hands on and helpful-((most of )) - reception guy gave great assistance with places to visit and view points  - another lady helped me with luggage room for free cos of no currency available with me   THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR  - Generator did sounded like generator  To much construction happening around   - VERY VERY SAD, I was as I went back to my room and discovered with my room mates  Who check in at 10:40  20 mins after I arrived were given the room but not me.  This was a very pretty lady but I felt bad and STEREOTYPED cos of my skin color  And was checked in on at 1 pm   Nothing new but HAD TO SHARE e"
3731,"Where to begin....as other reviewers noted, there is a massive, loud, strike outside the hotel. We’re talking blow horns, drums, and workers picketing right within 5 feet of the entrance. At 7am the noise from the strike was very loud and it lasted until late in the evening. Good thing I was barely in the room. Trust me - you will go crazy if you have to listen to this for more than 10 minutes.   Secondly, the housekeeping is on strike. Which means they have temps. Which means that my room was dirty. I stepped out of my shower, grabbed the towel on the rack, and unfolded it only to realize it was dirty - brown streaks on it like it had been dropped somewhere. The blanket on my bed was torn. Someone else’s hair in the bathroom. Ewwww.   Only breakfast options were a $40 buffet…"
3732,"Awful!  When we checked in, we were told nothing about the hotel, where to have breakfast, room service hours, nothing.  And there was nothing in the hotel room to give us this information.  The room was obviously not cleaned well before we arrived as we found a can of tobacco under our bed!  Disgusting!  The tub in the shower needs to be deep cleaned.  There seemed to be old adhesive on the bottom that has now gathered whatever is on the bottom of those that have previously stayed there's feet.  I was there to attend a conference and the hotel staff knew very little about where things were being held.  The concierge with the red glasses was extremely rude and unhelpful.  I told her the meeting I needed to be in and she told me to go on the shuttle to the convention center. …"
3733,"The location is fantastic and the hotel was only let down by the poor reception service and lack of iron. We stayed for 2 nights and each evening requested the use of an iron which was promised by the reception staff.  On both occasions after half an hour we had to re-request. The first time we were told that there was a problem and so we said we would leave it as we had other items to wear. On the second evening they told us that no iron existed so we not only had wasted 30 minutes waiting (twice) but also were left with un-ironed clothes to wear, both times after having been told that an iron was being sought and would be with us ‘shortly’.  Poor for a 4* hotel. Apart from that the hotel, room, location and breakfast were fantastic."
3734,"very Inconvenient gym and pool, located in the building next to the hotel where u need to walk a bit and every time u wanna go to the gym you have to collect a pass from the reception and return it back. After all that the gym is not good at all. very disappointing."
3735,"We enjoyed our stay in Lisbon very much, unfortunately the reception at check in was disappointing; We arrived at 12:00 PM very tired after a long flight. The receptionist Bruna was unfriendly and rude. Even though the hotel's policy is check in at 14:00 PM, She told us to come back after 14:30 PM and even later because the hotel is fully booked and the 2 rooms we booked were not ready yet. When we came back after 14:30, we were told by her that the rooms are still not ready, because they were changing mattresses. The annoying thing was that while telling us this she was multitasking (answering the phone, talking to the other receptionist and guests)- and then turned her back and left the desk.  Fortunately, Claudia heard our conversation and came to our help together with…"
3736,Good location very near metro and 6 min walk to station for airport links. Apartment was well equipped and comfortable. Local area had good restaurants and shops. front of apartment on a busy road next to a night club so some noise can be heard.
3737,"As a frequent business traveler it's always a hustle to find the right spot.  Your exhausted and just want to have a descent hotel with no worries, a quiet dark room, descent bed, powerful shower, excellent Wi-Fi , desk,  parking, good breakfast and strategic location. You can count on my hotel and restau reviews since I travel a lot.   This hotel: Rock n roll,  good location, spacious parking. However it lost already a lot if it's good things. I was here already since opening several times and it's losing his extras step by step. Breakfast became poor (where's the chocolate milk and variety of savoury??), beds are hard, rooms not quiet, shutters can't dark the room completely. Price quality OK. It's not bad but was better. "
3738,"It’s an aging property, which is still acceptable, primarily because of its central location. A bit of a damp, musky smell in the room. A fairly forgettable experience in general. What is hard to forget is their standard, old style  Hampton breakfast... Welcome to the 80s, where precooked omelettes, bagged breads, and yoghurts are considered deluxe! There were some “fresh” blueberries the morning we were there, but “fresh” hardly applies to that mush. Half-rotten, half smooshed... a simple question for the lady handling breakfast: Why put them out if they are WAY past their prime? It’s for people. People CANNOT eat that. Previously frozen and reheated “bagel toppers”? Seriously, who eats that stuff?!!! We are in the middle of Chicago, a great city of some of the most diverse…"
3740,"The location of the hotel is amazing! Very close to a lot of good restaurants and little café's. Our friends were staying in a different part of Berlin but it was very easy to get there due to 2 tube lines being on the same road as the hotel. My only criticism is that our room was at the front of the hotel on the first floor, so I felt a little exposed to passers by and at times it was a little noisy  "
3741,"My partner and I stayed here and it wasn't as nice as the pictures make it to be. We went 2 days without a shower as the shower head didn't work properly, this would of been an issue before we got there but nothing was obviously done about it. we asked to change rooms they said it would be fixed the next day but the guy didn't come nor returned there phone calls. After getting angry at them we were able to change rooms. "
3742,"Stayed in the Leonardo for a short city break in August. The hotel is in a great location and is very close to to one of the many train stations, which offers great links to Schonefeld airport in 30 minutes. Rooms are very comfortable. Our room had no bath, but did have a huge walk-in shower. Breakfast was delicious."
3743,"We arrived 3rd June for a 2 night stay for our sons sixteenth birthday . We stayed in a two bed apartment with a balcony and terrace and couldn't be more pleased with the apartment . It was clean , modern and well situated for exploring the area .   The only problem that we encountered was the noise from the bar below . Friday night the noise was noticeable but on Saturday night the music was so loud it made sleeping near on impossible !  For two nights this was okay but I have to say if we were planning on staying longer this kind of noise is wholly unacceptable .     Reception members of staff and the ladies who did the turn down Service were so so lovely .   All in all it was a brilliant break slightly tarnished by the noise issue so if you are hard of hearing this is…"
3744,"We were a little nervous since we never heard back from them about getting transport from the airport, but the metro system is easy enough to understand that it wasn't a major issue.   Staff was very nice and helpful, explained everything very clearly. Even gave suggestions which was nice.   Only downside was our room was boiling hot. The aircon only blew out warm air and we were in the courtyard facing rooms with only one window that could open. Since we were only staying a night and were very jetlagged we decided not to make a fuss but it made it a little uncomfortable. Also, we weren't made aware that the minibar was free since we had a deluxe room (we saw the prices and guessed that they weren't) until we checked out. Oh well, next time we will double check.   Nice centrally…"
3745,"Hotel about 10/15 min bus trip into the centre, Regular buses. Not much around the hotel more or a business base. Comfortable beds and clean rooms bathroom pod. Environmental entrance doors operate on sensors. Staff friendly and helpful"
3746,"My first stay at the Lyric Hotel was excellent! Rooms were clean and comfortable, staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming, lots of breakfast options, and location was excellent. Highly recommend this hotel, will definitely be a return customer! "
3748,"This is difficult to write.  I'm a lifetime Platinum Premier + Ambassador with Marriott.  As stated in the title, regardless of the class of hotel, I rate the hotel by how well I sleep.  I mostly stay in hotels for business and primarily Marriott.  I have a very demanding job as most people who travel for their jobs do.  I do not sleep well at this hotel.  The rooms are just too warm.  I was informed by the duty manager that the air conditioning system has been turned off for the season.  Well, it's quite comfortable outside, but the windows do not open and even if they did, I'd be dealing with car horns all night.  If I was not here for an executive team meeting, I would be moving to a hotel that out guests comfort at the top of the list of priorities.    The duty manager has…"
3749,"Friendly staff, refurbished room was bright and clean. Room and bathroom were good size for the price.  Wi-Fi worked very well.  Air conditioning was okay.  We were on third floor (no lift) but staff carried our cases up (which were heavy). Breakfast was okay (standard to any place in France).  Plenty of places nearby to eat out at night.  Would stay again."
3751,"Is a nice, new and clean hotel. Staff is really friendly and helpful. There are 2 near metro stations. Hotel is located not that far from center and all the attractions. Wi-fi is included on the price . Area is nice modern and safe. Rooms, are classical Ibis hotel rooms. "
3752,"Safe doesn’t work, water goes from hot to cold with no reason, the appearance is old and outdated. The room “upgrade” for me was a down grade. They want to change me to another room at my third night, doesn’t work when you need to pack and repack late night or early morning.... need to work"
3753,"Small room, but more than nice enough for two and good price. Nice hotel with an excellent breakfast buffet. Very attentive staff. Good selection of restaurants in and adjacent to hotel. Reasonable close to La Rambas ave."
3754,"Accommodation good, pool area fine and small beach great. However, food absolutely awful! The restaurant looked like a cafeteria and had no atmosphere. The food was bland and terrible. The wine and drinks were not much better! Never again! It's also pretty much in the middle of nowhere!"
3755,I payed extra for superior room and if my room was superior I'd hate to see the standard room. The room on the bottom floor of a small courtyard smelled damp and was very small and dark. However the noise was just dreadful. I tried going for a nap after a long flight and housekeeping decided to move furniture around In the room above me for 3 hours. I informed the staff at reception about the noise and I didn't even get an apology. Breakfast was minimal and coffee was disgusting. Stay somewhere else as it is a small town and everywhere is central.  
3756,The hotel is clean and the food is good. But I had a personal issue with the staff working at the front desk. One of the working boys has stolen my number and started contacting me privately and sending me his pictures and asking intimate questions. This is unprofessional and inappropriate! Solo traveler women be aware of sexual harassment at this hotel!
3757,"I spend 5 days in this hotel in my honeymoon trip. The rooms of this hotel are very comfortable, there is basically everything you need to have good moments in Paris. Also, it's in a great location, near to 3 metro stations. But what we loved most in this hotel was the great support of the staff. In some moments we needed some local information about the city that requested some french speaker and altough it was not their obligation, the staff was really very gently and made our stay easier and pleasant in Paris. Congrats to Paula and Margeaux for the gently and precious support provided to me and my wife during our stay."
3758,"Stayed here over the first weekend of September as a quick break to explore Amsterdam.   The hotel is very close to the metro station Wibaustraat, tickets are around 3 euros for an hour although we bought a two day ticket for 12.50 euros to help us get around. You could just as easily walk as everything is close together although Central Station is about a 30-40 minute walk so perhaps a little far out if you aren't keen on walking far! There is also a supermarket nearby with restaurants and shops straight ahead towards the canal.  The room was lovely and modern, the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean and tidy. The blinds in the room were great as they blocked out all of the light too!  There is no room service option which would have been helpful after our flight was…"
3759,"My family of five stayed in two rooms at hotel Tourisme the last three nights. The hotel is very clean and the rooms are well equipped with nice towels and toiletries. The staff are very helpful and warm. We would definitely stay here again. Next to metro, Starbucks, McDonald’s and monoprix(grocery store). The beds are very comfortable. Great stay."
3760,"If you know you won't be having any special requests, this hotel is for you. The rooms are spacious and beautiful and the breakfast is excellent. BUT, this hotel claims a 5-star rating, which gives customers a reason to expect reasonable service for reasonable requests. This was not the case.  Our first concerns were raised when the check-in people were marginally fluent in English. Not a big deal, but again, this is supposed to be a 5-star hotel. A much bigger disappointment was when I went to the concierge to ask where the nearest pharmacy might be. This gentleman did not seem to have any idea what I was asking and certainly couldn't provide me the information (we were able to find one about two blocks away). Finally, my wife and the couple we were traveling with went to the…"
3761,"This hotel's big problem for me was the lack of wifi in the room, or any other internet by the way! The only way to access was in the lobby, so I had to spend a big part of my time there.  Shameful for a chain like Accor..."
3763,"Very nice breakfast, big rooms, everything is clean,  friendly staff, location is good close to metro and 10min to city center, parking is ok but expensive. Hotel for every recommendation. Berlin is the best."
3764,"We couldn't recommend this place enough. The service provided and friendliness was more than we could have hoped for. We arrived late on a Thursday and were greeted as friends by Crystelle. She speaks impeccable English and made us feel totally welcome. There is a person on reception 24/7 and you drop your key in as you leave so no chance of loosing it. Free wifi available to all guests, which was great and the rooms were clean and comfortable. It's not the ritz, but doesn't profess to be either and you get great value for what you pay for. I found the website a little hard to navigate and so e-mailed the hotel direct. To be honest, I'm glad I did as this gave me a direct link to them and they were so helpful even in the run up to our stay. To cap it all, we were due to fly on a…"
3765,"The hotel itself is very nice and has a very good location.  The staff is great.  Welcoming and Professional.  The bar is even better.  The best drinks we have ever tasted, skilled and serviceminded.  If you have not tried it I would recommend it. I will be back!"
3767,"The location of the hostel was perfect and the rooms were decent, however, the staff was rather rude to me and my friends. They seemed not to care about our stay and also not willing to help us with, for example, the lockers downstairs. Neither did they even greet us when we were checking in. That decreased the experience we had incredibly. "
3769,"I will definitely stay here again if I visit paris again! The room was clean and SO CUTE! It’s also very close to the Eiffel Tower, and places to shop. I Would definitely recommend this hotel to couples. Great for a romantic getaway."
3770,"We’re so glad we chose to stay in this hotel. The price was reasonable, the room was clean and cleverly designed and the hotel had the feel of a trendy and arty hostel but the professionalism and service of a good hotel. We got in really late after a night out and asked if we could pay for a later checkout but the hotel staff checked the system and offered it to us for free.. and we had a good giggle when checking out with the same ladies on the way out. This is how hotels should run! We left with heavy hearts and can’t wait to come stay again. "
3772,"Stayed here last week for 3 nights with two friends and we got a deluxe room that would fit us all. The room was lovely, it was a very good size. The beds were supercomfy and the hotel was quiet so we were able to get a good nights sleep every night. The bathroom was also spacious and it had a lovely ‘rainfall shower’ which was divine after a long day of walking around sight seeing.   Our room faced out onto the road but the hotel is in quite a quiet area so you won’t be woken up during the night, you do hear the churchbells but they are nice.  Each floor in the hotel seems to have a vending machine which is handy to buy snacks/ drinks/ alcohol if you wish.   Drank at the hotel bar a few times and it is very good value for money (usually hotel bars are exceptionally expensive,…"
3773,"The hotel is ok - bar one major issue - the AC!  It is incredibly noisy!  Even if you switch if off (which I did as don't like sleeping with AC), the central AC still rattles throughout the building.  I had to move rooms as I couldn't sleep with the rattling from the central AC.   The second room was slightly better but also started rattling on my last night.  Radisson, the AC in this hotel is not acceptable - you need to get it upgraded asap. I will not stay here again because of this issue."
3774,"The Grimm's hotel is beside modern very cozy. The rooms are clean and very nice although they are quite small (But Berlin isn't a town to stay in your hotel room too often). The bed is small as well. The bathroom was big, with a nice shower and very clean as well! The staff was friendly and helpfull.  The breakfast was fine as well, no too much fresh fruit or vegetables, but good bread an more than enough to choose from.  Just around the corner (Neue Grünstrasse) is a lovely place to have homemade lunch, it's called 'Cappucino'. You can walk within 20 minutes to a lot of nice places everywhere in Berlin, the U-Bahn (Spittelmarkt) is just 5 minutes walk away."
3775,"Unbelievably poor service. Examples:  I self parked,  I drive a Tesla and have had valets take liberties with my car, which has an app so I know exactly when my car is moved. I was told there were valets at self park to help no one was there so I schlepped my stuff.   Next I ordered a Caesar salad and was told there was a two hour wait, which I reluctantly accepted. I used there online service so 75 minutes later, I confirmed that room service received my order and double checked what time it would arrive. I was told 11pm, consistent with my expectations at that point as I ordered just before 9pm  11:10pm still no salad so I contacted front desk and was told it would be free, which was nice, but I was still hungry and hoping. I can't sleep when I'm starving. So I asked to speak…"
3777,Had a nice time at Vidamar dispite  weather not being good spent a good few quid on trips and gifts etc but both my wife and I were laid low for the last two days with what seemed like world war three of the bowel dept and got in a panic we may not make return flight the staff were very attentive by organising a doctors visit and the supply of prescribed medication and bottled water.
3778,"We have a 3.5 mo old infant and planned our first getaway with her last weekend after being told this was a very kid friendly hotel.  But we had NUMEROUS issues which I am still working out with the hotel: - Requested early check in, which they were able to accomodate, but then when we arrived, our room was down a huge flight of stairs - NOT helpful when you have a stroller! We then had to wait 2.5 hours until almost 5pm for them to give us another more family friendly room - Requested a crib and they have pack and plays which we said was fine HOWEVER the pack and play came with one flat sheet which did not wrap securely around the mattress, creating a clear suffocation hazard! We asked three times for a fitted sheet and they told us they didn't have them.  Finally, they brought…"
3779,"Bathroom excellent, bed perfect, kitchenette needed a little fixing but otherwise great. Friendly people, cocktail hour with nice drinks, quite in the room, no noise at night. Just everything you need. "
3780,"I have stayed at all of the luxury hotels in Cannes over many years, including the Hotel Martinez pre-renovation.  I would say that the hotel now is the finest I've stayed in.  For room design, service, cleanliness."
3781,"Sorry to say but the hotel was not as expected.  The location is amazing and we truly enjoyed our visit to Kauai but next time we visit, we will definitely not return to this hotel.  first off I was excited that they offered a military discount and then when we checked out they gave us the discount for one night only.  The added fees and taxes etc not worth the 499$ a night base charge to stay at the hotel.  My room was outdated, in room coffee bar not stocked and housekeeping below par to say the least in terms of bathroom walls etc.  I have stayed in other Hyatts across the country and must say this one disappointed."
3782,"The best thing about this hotel is the location - just near Avenida Paulista. However, I would rank it no higher than three stars. The rooms are extremely basic (though at least they are clean). We paid extra for a 'premium' room and I really cannot imagine what was 'premium' about it.   We visited in winter and it was rather cold; not only does a 'premium' room have no heating, but a request for a second blanket had to be made FOUR times before someone finally brought us one. The bed had thin sheets - no chance of a duvet.  Breakfast was OK, but completely self service - make your own coffee, serve yourself from the buffet. No eggs made to order.   Even when we arrived at the door in a taxi, no one opened the door or helped with our bags.  So, in summary, it is a 'cheap and…"
3783,"This past September I spent a week at Villa Agas. There was an improvement from last year. There was free WIFI and as you walked into the villa there was a sign for the settings. The people who run the place don't speak English but seem to understand what you want. This is an inexpensive place to stay. If you walk up the driveway you can have breakfast at Hotel Lodos . And you can swim in their pool. Across the street is a supermarket where you can buy groceries and use the refrigerator in your room. The walk to the center of Fira is about 20 minutes away. Once in Fira , if you wish, you can take a bus back to the hotel. The hotel is cheap and good if you are on abudget."
3784,"Very pleasant hotel close to some of main attractions and museums in Amsterdam. The hotel is located in an old and typical dutch building. So, the hotel isn't big, but the atmosphere and decoration, are just amazing. The room are quiet comfortable and with enough space. The staff are helpful, specially the ladies dealing with the breakfast. I didn't give a higher rating to the hotel, because of 2 important details: when you book a ""small room"" through Booking.com, the pictures don't correspond to the room space. The room shown on Booking is much bigger than the reality. The small room, is really claustrophobic! So, we ask for an upgrade to a bigger room and no issues with that. The second is regarding the cleanness of the hotel. a mouse in the kitchen room?!? I'm sorry but this…"
3785,A beautiful historic building that needs a massive restoration.  No outlets in the rooms.  Dark and musty.  I was afraid to put my bare feet in the carpet.  I would love to return to that building once it experienced a massive redo.  I will not return or refer anyone until ownerships returns it to it's old glory.  
3787,"I was there just for 4 days - all comfort is extra class: room wide and with all facilities for living and work, great location for visitors of the Uni, not in the center of Berlin but by the Uni. Staff is friendly and know how to serve guests, breakfast - German quality."
3788,"Pleased with the location, very near the Gothic Quarter, stations, local market and the port. Breakfast is perfectly adequate and rooms are clean. Staff very helpful and speak English very well. Will go back again. "
3790,"While the staff is nice, the hotel is basic but clean, and the location is close to downtown, you need to avoid this hotel at all costs.  The property is built literally on top of I94 - this is the major highway going right through Chicago.  Trucks, cars, busses, ambulances, and everything else is blasting by your room all night.  Even the free earplugs they give away (yes, they give earplugs) don't help.  Don't stay here!!! As I write this at 4.45 am (couldn't sleep), I am vowing to never return."
3791,"I booked my room and prepaid through your website. Upon check in my credit card was requested. I stated that I had already paid for the room. Star, the front desk employee, confirmed my card would be stored for incidentals and the amount held would be $35. I provided my card and she swiped it. I again confirmed with her that my card was swiped just for $35. She checked her computer and reported, no, my card was swiped for $175. I showed her proof I had already paid for my room. She agreed but informed me ‘ something was set up incorrectly on your end with my reservation.  She went on to inform me that she could not correct this error and had to wait for her manager to do it. I received a call later that day confirming the manager had reversed the charge. However, the additional…"
3792,"We just loved staying here and will do so again. Great outdoor terraces to eat, drink and watch the world go by. The staff are incredibly helpful and service oriented. Food was excellent and the buffet breakfast had a wide variety of choice. Slightly chaotic in the mornings given it can be busy. On the Kurfürstendamm/ shopping paradise and lots of small restaurants and cafes around if you want a change from the hotel. Hop On Hop Off bus stop close by. You will certainly need that and irrespective of taking it to see the major sites we did 15000 steps a day. "
3793,Nice place with good location and access to subway station. Walking distance to Barcelona Cathedral and the Boqueria. Breakfast is a plus. Front desk staff is friendly. Room is clean. Will stay here again. 
3794,"There not really too much that I can say about this hostel other than it is absolutely amazing. My girlfriend and I stayed here for her birthday in one of the apartments for 3 nights and we had the most fantastic time.  Positives:  - The staff were exceptional, they really understood the city and the people; they were helpful, informative and understanding. Cannot fault them one bit and they really are a credit to the wombats name!  - Location. Right next to restaurants, bars, a pharmacy, a Netto and a late night kiosk - not to mention the fact it's right next to the U-Bahn station! This is in an unbelievably good place!  - Price: super affordable and what you get for the price is outstanding. This includes breakfast which is all-you-can-eat for €3.80pp!!! I couldn't believe it…"
3795,"Stayed there for 3 nights on family vacation. The hotel is very well located (or not so well, depends). Its in a very convenient walking distance to Brandenburg gate, checkpoint charlie, Unter den linden, Bundestag, BUT its right beneath a railway station, and a very busy one. So beware, ask for high floor rooms, and avoid second floor or lower (we had a very nice guy singing and playing guitar in the street till 11pm and could barely sleep). Also the train literally runs 15 metres from our window and we could wave goodbye to the commuters. Service was polite and well trained. If you can skip lower floors and know its a busy spot, go for it as its a good choice to stay in Berlin."
3796,"No way you can be a serious business traveler hotel with this WiFi.  Completely unacceptable.  Breakfast of Old shoe leather, powdered eggs and mounds of bread.  The place just rings of low expectation wrapped in lower brand standards.  I’d advise staying elsewhere...."
3797,"We forgot to lock our iPod in the safe and left it in our small hand-luggage whilst we were out.  The next day it was gone. Disappointing end to an otherwise excellent stay: we particularly love the size of the rooms, the location and  the attention to details. But having stuff stolen from my room reminded me of my backpacking days in youth hostels, not a place at £100 a night! Even more disappointing was the fact that, once we had checked out the owners did not even bother to come to talk to us to try to resolve the problem or even apologise.  Such a shame, an Ipod is nothing really but they need to do something about theft,  otherwise their reputation will suffer quickly."
3798,The worst staff attitude in the whole Hyatt hotels that I ever stayed.   Front door staffs aren't helpful even they see you carrying luggages.   Check-in staffs are cold and always try to ask you to pay more to upgrade to a better room.   
3799,"My sister and I were actually enjoyed our 2 nights stay in this hotel. It has strategic location, very informative receptionist (noon to night) and of course the spa team.  However, this good experience turned down with our check out experience on 21 June 2015, 4.50 am. We have informed hotel one night before that we will do early check out tomorrow morning, and what we met was a dark lobby - kept dark until we left, not welcoming receptionist, it took long for him to finish check out process (he even did not manage a taxi for us and did not help us with our big luggages to go down the stairs catching taxi by our own!!!). At the end we almost missed our flight back to our country - we all known how long checking process in Domestic airport in Vietnam, right?  Sorry, we think…"
3800,"I liked everything about this hotel except for the bed. It caused us back pain and that doesn't make for a good vacation. I don't see anyone else talking about the mattress, so maybe it was just our mattress, or our backs, I don't know. The mattress was a little different from the usual-- a three inch foam pad atop a padded box spring.  The hotel staff were kind and helpful and calls to reception were answered promptly. Breakfast was good. One morning when we were running late reception arranged for us to have breakfast after the 10 am closing time (so call them if you are running late).  The location of the hotel is very good--close to the beach and the metro. Walk to Arpoador to see the sun set. Rent bicycles to ride along Avenida Atlantica and the Lagoa.  Take the metro to…"
3801,"Have just returned from 3 nights here. It was absolutely flawless and couldn't have asked for better. There was champagne and chocolates in the room for my birthday. A very nice touch.  The room was huge and spacious , and spotless. The shower was great. Cant fault the room at all. The hotel bar was great too. Wouldn't hesitate to return here or recommend it. And the price we paid was great value. Thank you for making our visit to Berlin so relaxing and comfortable!"
3802,"On the 1st night that I checked in at the hotel, I found that body wash was left empty. On the other night, housekeeping forgot to put a wash cloth in the bathroom, forgot to replace the empty tissue box. I stay a total of ten nights here and they need to forget something every day. "
3803,"This hotel has a great location,however the negative out weighs the good here. The front desk staff is rude. The rooms are uncomfortable and really really hot. Don’t come on a weekend and stay on a lower floor, or you will deal with the walls shaking because of the noise. I give this place one star. Not that they deserve it, but for location. This not fancy hotel sucks. "
3805,"We were really looking forward to our trip to Desert Palms.  We liked that we had a two bedroom villa and space.  However, upon check in we learned that it was actual two separate rooms on the ground floor with an adjoining door in the middle.  Now if I had older children it would not be an issue, but I have two small children.  I voiced my concern at check in and was told that there are not only bolts, but a latch lock at the top of the door.  That statement was completely untrue.  For safety reasons my husband and I each slept in separate rooms with our kids. Upon entering the rooms there was a musty smell and in the kitchen it had the smell of bug spray.  Not sure if it was recently sprayed or what.  The first thing we noticed once we got the suitcases in and got settled was…"
3806,"Crisp, clean, newly decorated , quiet and close to everything you need. What more could one ask for?   Super close to Oberkamp and all its grooviness yet quiet. Great access to public transportation restaurants abound just round the corner.  Super comfy bed, big window, I appreciate that lots of thought put into the recent renovation of this hotel.  Cosy lounge,  bright happy cheerfully clean bathrooms, nice sense of deco...  What's best, however is the warmth of the staff.  You can tell this is family run and they know how to do things right.  On a scale of 1 to 5 I would rate this hotel as an 8 for value/quality and I will definately be back.  I enjoyed meeting all of you as well as exploring a part of Paris that up until now I never knew.  Bien a vous tous,     Madame…"
3807,"After staying six times in Miami It's the first time that i have to give a negative rating for a hotel. the positive aspects first: the Staff is really nice and helpful, the Pool area is very nice and it is  straight on the beach. We checked in today in Room 324 - it was totally dirty (black mold on the shower curtain, hair and dust everwhere), bed sheets dirty, the floor had more stains than original colour and the bathroom was so small that you couldn't even lift the toilet seat without hitting the toilet paper on the wall. My wive cryed and we decided to change our room for the first time in our vacations. After our complaint we moved over to room no 421. The good things are that it has been cleaned and the walls seemd to be painted within the last years. The bad things are:…"
3808,"Rooms are small, showers excellent, reception low key - it's one smallish access on the flank wall of a huge building. They offer room only rates which are very good value, not least when there are half a dozen better value places for breakfast in the same courtyard. Buses to everywhere in town less than 50m metres away"
3809,"The hotel has fleas and I was bitten in my arms, face and body. I had to check out at 4:30 am and there was anybody at the front desk, I had to leave the key on the mail box and leave. It is supposed to be a 24 h front desk. Besides that the hotel staff was friendly. A lot of homeless around the hotel, the didn't make me anything but it felt uncomfortable. It is 15-20 min walking to union square.  I know is a 2 star hotel, but having fleas is disgusting and unsanitary, I have to stay in bed for one day. About Hotwire I is the worst service ever. I called 2 times before checkin and asked for an upgrade of the hotel (even if  had had to pay more because when the hotel was assigned I wasn't satisfied with the hotel given vs. the coast paid and also read the trip advisor reviews and…"
3810,"We recently returned to the Hotel-Pension Enzian having last been there in 1987, yes 32 years ago!  We had stayed there while studying in what was then West Berlin and had very fond memories.  The staff this past week was warm and inviting, and the accommodations equally so.  It's in a great neighborhood that is quiet and residential, but has everything you could need nearby, and the Botanischer Garten S-bahn stop is within 50 meters so you truly can get anywhere in minutes.  There is good reason that all the reviewers say 5 stars.  And that's because of the people that make the Enzian as inviting as it is."
3811,"Stayed for 2 nights for the New Year. First time in this hotel, and I know the area quite well, as I am used to stay in some of the other hotels in this area. As earlier reviewers has mentioned, the hotel is new, clean all over, and I am quite happy with the standard of the room. I booked breakfast on my last day. It was much better than expected and it has a larger range of food than you could expect in similar rated hotels. Very good !  Just a short walk to Rambla Poblenou, you have all the various shops for food. Another short walk upwards the street, you get to a reasonable large mall Glories, where you find H&M, Zara, Burgerking, Adidas, NIKE, Starbucks.  I am impressed, and I will certainly recommend the hotel to other travellers. A short walk to the beach makes this hotel…"
3812,Had 1 night in Barcelona so the location was ideal. Guys on the desk were friendly and we were grateful that our room was ready a few hours before check in. The bathroom is a bit dated but very functional and nice toiletries were provided including shoe shine. No bother no fuss and sweeties and fruit available on the reception desk. Thank you
3813,I have been to this hotel several times and have had mixed experiences. Today took the cake. 2 people st check in- no cheat line- problem with their system that took some time to figure out.  To beat this- 2 hrs and still waiting for room service! They are “backed up” and hgd front desk staff is taking orders. No restaurants open after 10pm.   Not sure what kind of business this is.  Rooms are nice  But really??? This is unacceptable.
3814,"Stayed 5 nights at the Novotel Lisboa, the breakfast was Awesome, but busy. The room was a bit small, the staff where helpful and friendly. I didn't used the hotel parking which costs 11 euros a night. There is free 24 parking at the rear of the hotel on the side of the hotel, but it's really hard to find parking there. On the street you can park for free on weekends andon weekdays from 7pm to 9am all Other times there a meter with a 4 hr limit. Be care with the meter I did see one car with a boot on it. The hotel is very nice, the biggest problem is that there is Nothing near the hotel just other hotels. No cafes, shops or bars. Kind of a dead zone of hotels and nothing else."
3815,"I stayed at this hotel between 7th and 11th March 2019. The booking was by my institution on my behalf and I was very much excited to visit Chicago. I arrived at the hotel around 15:30 local time and the receptionist was quite friendly. Everything was fine until they asked me to pay USD100 per night as [security] deposit (USD400). To put this into perspective, the daily deposit was more that the daily cost of the room. I quickly checked the booking confirmation that my institution gave me and there was no mention of this deposit. I told them that I didn't have enough money in my travel card, but they refused to check me in despite the fact that the room was fully paid. I had to stay at their lounge for about an hour as I was waiting for my colleague back home to put money in my…"
3817,"So I was already going to write a great review as I loved my time there, lovely and clean rooms, awesome location with cafes all around, wonderful staff, a cute lounge area with Kumsi Tea & Nespresso for afternoon pick me ups and for the price I paid I felt it was good value for money.   Then after I had checked out I received an email informing me I'd left something in the safe of my room which turned out to be a cherished necklace. They promptly mailed my belongings back to my home in Hong Kong and sent me the receipt, tracking number and a picture of the package for reference.  They could have easily kept the necklace and called it a day but didn't so I am eternally grateful! "
3818,"Good hotel, rooms small but functional. Comfortable beds and clean. Only thing that let it down was breakfast. Staff arrogant and very poorly managed. Especially Friday morning. No tables & hot food 'finished' after queuing 10mins. One member of staff very nice. A few manners & more respectful attitude would work wonders. "
3819,"The location is excellent - easy walking to Checkpoint Charlie, Brandenberg Gate and the Tiergarten. Check in was smooth and the rooms are large and great value for the price. The interior is very grand and the lifts are plentiful and quick. The only niggle was the bar prices - far higher than similar bars in the vicinity."
3820,I would rate the hotel 1 1/2 out of 5.   We found your hotel on Orbitz and it was rated 3 stars out of 5.    Your location is excellent.   Parking convenient.  Entry way and rooms are shabby.  Window treatments are out of date and dirty.  Shower was difficult.   Hampton Inns are 3 star.   You could learn from them
3822,"This hotel has incredible views but beyond that, we were not particularly impressed by it.  It's built on a steep, narrow strip down the rim of the volcano so a lot of hotel has been crammed into a small space and it requires negotiating steep stairs to get anywhere.  The rooms/bathrooms are unusual and pretty but I got tired of a quirky shower with its shower head right up against the wall and the single wall hook to hang all the wet towels and bath robes on. Otherwise the room was comfortable and spotless with all the usual amenities.  The hotel food was very fresh and beautifully prepared. And we agree with the countless compliments for the staff at the hotel.  This hotel may be rated 5 stars in Greece but sorry, it's not the Ritz.  It did not feel particularly luxurious and…"
3824,"1st day had to switch rooms because the TV was not working properly. I call for ice at 2:30 was delivered at 3:15. After a fantastic night in and around town my wife and I came back to the room to watch a movie and have cocktails only to find out that the mini bar was empty. Called for service and had to wait for a while for service. I was promised that it had been an oversight and that first thing in the morning the mini bar would be recstocked. Next afternoon went to my room and order ice (Had to call twice 53 mianutes) when the ice finally arrived open the mini bar and... Nothing, nada, zero mini bar was the same. Had to walk to a nearby store to get refreshments. Try to get a room in another hotel but they were all booked do to fleet week. Talk to the Manager and he listen…"
3825,"The hotel is reasonably placed for a tourist visit. Close to bus and train routes and plenty of restaurants. The internet service is dreadful , continually dropping out and with a complex password “sign-in” system and log-on that really dominates your stay.  Our group of 10 people all found it horrendous !"
3826,"I like Erik Vokel apartments because for same price as a room you get some space, a kitchen, a couch, a way to spread out.  I found that this apartment was much more sparsely furnished than the one I stayed at in Madrid a year ago but still comfortable and so close to Sagrada Familia which was high on our list of must-see."
3828,"I’m currently staying at the Miami oceanfront hotel, the hotel it self is right on the beach , the pool area is clean we really like the bartender at the tiki bar. However last night around 7:30 on the boardwalk area my daughter and her friend both 17 were mugged and their phones were  taken , thankfully they were ok shaken and crying but unharmed . They come to room after calling the phone carriers and cards they had mine for food or drinks , I call the desk to get the non emergency phone number to the police , explaining my situation, he goes oh well you need to come down immediately your over your 150 credit authorization and your card was just declined I said yes my daughter and her friend were mugged right outside the holiday inn on the boardwalk . No sympathy expressed , just well you need to come immediately I said ok I just have to get this taken care of first and hang up he calls me back immediately to tell me again , mean while my bill was 188 , 38 over the 150 authorization . He could have cared less that 2 teenagers were just mugged who were staying at his hotel right outside the property . I went and paid it immediately to satisfy him I just thought a I’m so sorry this happened to you would have been nice .…"
3829,"Big hotel close to the city centre, with an impressive lobby. Personnel tends to be too corteous, but still service is efficient. Rooms are even too big and with a nice decor. However, elevators are not that fast and breakfast is not available for the early birds. Nopr any alternative service is offered. And this, considering what you pay for the room, is not nice at all. Less appearance and more substance, please!"
3830,"My brother and I decided to take a trip across Europe and we were very unsure of the culture change. When we arrived at the Hotel, we were welcomed by the concierge as if we were family. Latrice gave us the insides and outsides of things to view in Paris. She was by far one of the friendliest people one could encounter. She did not just do this for us, but for ever guest that came through the door. As many of the guests were from the states, she took the time to make sure we knew exactly where we were to go and some other ideas to spend our time wisely.    The rooms were quite clean and many of the other people working in the hotel greeted us very kindly each morning. The breakfast buffet was an arrangement of meats, yogurts, coffees, fruits, and of course grains. Going back to…"
3831,"Excellent hotel with wellness centre and gym open 24hr. Internally is very well maintened and you feel like being in a classy 5 stars hotel, rooms are very large and comfortable. furnitures can be upgraded but thats not a huge concern.  "
3832,"This hotel has a great location.  Steps away from the Friedrichstrasse train station.  Also walking distance from points of interests like The Brandenburg, Checkpoint Charlie, the Museum Island, stores and restaurants. This hotel is clean and modern."
3833,"I stayed at the Marriott hotel in January 2019 and found it to be very friendly, convenient , comfortable and excellent service. for sure, I will be going back to this hotel. the staff is very friendly and cooperative."
3835,"It never ceases to amaze me how destructive rude staff and ridiculous charges can be.  I booked the Opal based on reviews and location.  Upon arrival I discover that there is a $47 per night charge for parking.  On top of that I find out that they will not accept my British credit card 'because it has a chip'.  Utterly ridiculous. Having just finished a road trip lasting a month I have not had problems with my card at any of the other hotels or motels.  When I mentioned this and the fact that plenty of Brits must stay here, the obnoxious member of staff told me that they probably had proper credit cards. I'm sure the Halifax would be delighted to hear it.  Moving on to the room. The stench of bleach was overpowering when entering the tired, tiny room that they are charging the…"
3836,"You wont find any extraordinary extras (you weren't looking for anyway). The Hotel only offers Doubble bed stil rooms. The rooms are do have a small table, two chairs and small TV beside the mentioned bed. The bathroom is modern style too and you wont miss anything here too. WiFi isn't the fastest but reasonable. 3 minutes walk to the Kudamm as well as to the close Savignyplatz with its metro station (the well known Kaufhaus des Westens or KaDeWe is also in walking distance). Typical Berlin all-night open bars and restaurants are also just a foodstep away."
3837,"good price-performance ratio, close to Metro, clean, refurbished, bring your own lock for the locker in the room. A Velib station ( Paris bike rental) is close to metro station, but in the morning often empty. "
3838,"I did love this hotel but it is suffering a little unfortunately due to either low morale or staff overwork.   Some of the restaurant staff are positively unfriendly - particularly at breakfast - to the point where we avoided certain areas if we saw the same staff members.   Lunch time service can be very slow due to overcrowding - no fault of the staff there.   Pool area is suffering badly from lounger “reserving” - my previous three visits to this hotel the pool team were removing towels. Not this time, just leaving notices and doing nothing. If you stay on top of this then it doesn’t become a problem as new guests quickly realise this is the policy.   Gardens as beautiful as ever and the garden team seem to work their socks off!  I did love this chain, by it might be time to…"
3840,"Everything in the neighborhood, even public transport is at a short walking distance.  Friendly welcome, spacious clean hotel suite with all comforts Great accommodation for a perfect city break for family, friends or couples "
3842,"I was made to pack up and leave my room in the middle of the day when I had a reservation.   I was visiting San Francisco to attend a conference. I had a reservation from March 11th to March 15th.   On March 14th, I received a call in my room after noon that I was expected to checkout on March 14th. I was told I had a reservation only till March 14th and I had to leave the room immediately and was incurring late fees at the moment. I asked if I could extend my reservation and was told that there were no openings.  I quickly packed up and left the room (while missing some conference sessions that I wanted to attend) and dropped off the keys and started checking other hotels that I could move to.   Finally, someone nice at the front desk during check out, got ""permission"" and gave…"
3843,"I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. The rooms were dirty- chairs with ripped upholstery, the room smelled like urine, there isn't A/C but instead little fans that move the smelly air around. The blinds had what I can only guess to be bug poop stains."
3844,"My husband, my daughter and I had stayed at this hotel previously in Nov-Dec 2018 for 3 weeks, service was impressive and we enjoyed it, so we chose this place again for our stay in Aug 2019, for 2 weeks. However, service this time was appalling. We had removed the ""do not disturb"" sign from our door, and the staff did not bother coming to check or clean our room at all until asked. This was very disappointing as we have paid a lot of money for the room and got absolutely no service or maintenance at all. Secondly, during our checkout on Aug 15 11AM, the woman wearing glasses at the reception was extremely rude and accused my husband for opening a water bottle in the fridge when we did not. She had wasted our time for over 20 minutes and humiliated my husband in front of all the staff and asked them to go upstairs into the room and check whether he had opened any other bottles. Why would we lie about a water bottle which costs 20 or 30 cents? Absolutely disrespectful behaviour considering we have been loyal customers to this hotel. Lastly, while we were waiting for the taxi, another staff very rudely walked around us and did not even bother to greet or acknowledge us. She even rudely tried to intrude and inspect us acting like we stole something. I am extremely disappointed at the behaviour of staff and the terrible service at this hotel. I think the managers need to do a better job at training their staff or getting better ones. This is not a 5-star service hotel at all, more like 2-stars I would say. We will not be coming back at all.…"
3845,"Staff very welcoming on arrival, probably best to turn the heating down early before going to bed as it is very warm - which in the cold is a good thing generally. Found the beds to be very firm - which is not our preference but will suit many. Excellent breakfast with an omelette station in operation. Nice bar with friendly staff and very convenient location close to shops restaurants and subway. They have waterbeds which the staff kindly let us have a look at - but not sure that would suit us as a solution to the firm beds  Nice touch of having coffee machines on floors for guests to use"
3846,"Rooms to Streets are extremely noisy, even on the 6th floor. I woke up three times 2, 3.30am. People on the streets where loud, going the next party. I would recommend a room to the other side, not to Union Square. This morning, I am glad that I was already awake, a strike was going on for two hours from 6am - 8am. With loudspeaker.  I do not know how long it will repeat in the next week/ month, because the do it for some time already. Also, it smells in my room, not very pleasant. Where the ""exclusive ambiente"" and ""nicest hotel in San Francisco""  from the other reviewer is coming from, I have no idea. I am glad to move the room tonight and only stay for one more night."
3847,"We recently stayed at the hotel and we were a large party of 13! The rooms were spacious, well lit, clean and nicely decorated.  Its location in the Gothic quarter made it very accessible to the majority of the city sites. Also we loved the unexpected but charming roof top pool and lounge area. The best part though was the staff. Can I say AMAZING service!! I have traveled extensively and stayed at more ""fancy"" hotels all over the world but this staff topped all them. They were so warm, friendly, knowledgeable, and professional. I want to give special recognition to  Laura, Sal, and Adam.  They even personally took my parents to a store to help them shop for an item. So helpful and thoughtful!!"
3848,"Location and offering are a good fit for somebody who wants to explore the city by foot although good metro connection is given, too. Friendliness of staff (also English speaking), cleanliness and breakfast add to the very good impression for travellers. Opera is just a 10 minute walk."
3849,"We wanted to stsy near the Galleries and this hotel is perfect. Use the Saint Lazare exit to get close to hotel. We exited by the galleries and had to walk around to get to the hotel. The beds are comfortable, bathroom is clean and chic, room is quiet. Great find. Warning - the elevator starts on the 1st floor so you will have to walk up one flight of stairs."
3850,We arrived a little early but the reception kindly held our Luggage in order for us to go out and enjoy the City  Nice accommodation with a nice balcony and Easy access to Berlin. The neighborhood has several good restaurants and offer something for every tast
3851,"The only issue we had with this hotel is that the lobby smelled like the sewer and the price for the room was high for what you got. The room was nice, the location was perfect. There was no traffic noise."
3852,"we loved staying at Pavilion Nation hotel. Every body here is very friendly and helpful especially Tarek the director, Tina the receptionist, and the nice lady in the breakfast room. Thank you and we definitely will come back here in the future. "
3854,"Max Hotel is in a great Paris neighborhood, not at all touristy, with shops and restaurants and the metro nearby.  We were there in November, so essentially off-season, and the price was extremely reasonable.  Rooms are very small but very clean and well designed (as is the well-stocked bathroom), cheerful with lots of light - and the nice touch of a Nespresso machine for those of us who love (and need) our strong morning coffee.  And there's a tiny balcony on the third floor where we sat and took in a view of Paris rooftops - can't beat that.  The staff is friendly and helpful."
3855,"Terrible service, very small misleading rooms and bathrooms, flashing alarm clock, stains on the window blinds, coffee maker didn't work, refrigerator didn't work, scratchy towels, and ""resort fees"" for amenities not used. "
3856,"Maybe I'm too fussy but I really wanted to like this place. The setting is lovely and the walk to the beach below is easy as long as you are fairly mobile. For us it was a bit of a let down. The service was pretty poor and generally miserable. Brekkie wasn't great. It was all a little bit shabby. Which is a shame as it could be so nice with a lick of paint, some new towels, new sun beds and some training. I don't normally have a winge but this place deserves to be so much better. "
3857,"It was fastidiously clean, the breakfast was minimal but very nice, the staff brilliant and the only downside part in my opinion was there was no where outside to relax ie a patio etc. Apart from the latter we would go again mainly because it’s literally 2 streets away from where the Cannes Film Festival is held plus the cafes and bars are very good even though they are are very expensive and start right on the street where the hotel is based. Do yourselves a favour and go it’s worth it.👍"
3858,The rooms are new and modern as well as clean. The location is good close to the city but quiet. The check in was nice and very good with some tipps for santorini. The check out was very quick no question how we liked our stay. The breakfast was ok but would be nice to have fresh orange juice for this price. The Jacuzzi was not clean and had a weird smell to it also it took more than 1 hour to heat up in the evening.  Overall it's not worth the price. 
3859,"Clean rooms, friendly staff When I plan my next trip, possibly will choose CR7 again. Hopefully, till that time they will put slippers for the guests :) But in general, the stay was nice and the location is one of the best"
3860,"We had a wonderful stay at this hotel which was made even more memorable by the welcoming and attentive staff member overseeing the bar area. From the moment we met Frederick he made every effort to make us feel at ease and truly welcomed, patiently answering all of our questions and offering lots of advice and helpful suggestions. He is an absolute credit the hotel and couldn't do enough for us. As a result we will be recommending this hotel to all our our colleagues who travel to Paris regularly."
3861,"The Pullman hotel is a fine choice in the Tiergarten area of town. It is somewhat less expensive than the Intercontinental, across the street. The room was very comfortable and clean. the hot water pot was fully stocked. However, the room was too warm. I asked at reception to have it fixed and it wasn't until the last evening that it was fixed and made all the difference! The Breakfast option is fine with plenty of choices both hot and cold. The TV is very limited for English with the main news channel being Russia Today News....Would appreciate a few more TV choices in English."
3862,"We had two rooms over looking the canal which very pretty. Little bit noisy for the outside at night due to drinkers on there way home.  Hotel it’s self has great staff very helpful and friendly.The room design are not private with the glass loo and you can hear everything.shower is excellent with a large drench head. Bed was good and comfortable, pillows are large and very very soft.Our rooms was clean but very dusty and damp smell in one of the rooms.  Noise from the rooms above is also a problem if you like to be in bed before 11pm. Also the gym is not on site it’s down the road in s different building.  Do not forget your room tax."
3863,"Literally the worst hotel we have ever stayed at---the W hotel in City Center--no parking garage except one around the corner ($35) or valet parking ($60 an night) They wouldn't let me, his wife with same name check in because only my husband's name on the reservation. And of course he was off parking the car!!!!  Long line at check-in only to be greeted by THAT.  Our room was literally the size of a walk-in closet with one VERY UNCOMFORTABLE double bed.  Sheets were scratchier than a Days Inn.  Closet door once closed wouldn't open again.  Bathroom the size of an AIRPLANE BATHROOM!!!! Uncomfortable double bed inexplicably faces a large bookshelf filled with expensive snacks while the flat screen TV is off to the side and so you cannot watch the TV comfortably AT ALL.  Half the…"
3864,"Hotel Midmost is really central with good access to nearby metro. The rooms were nice and a good size, bathroom perhaps could be nicer (shower curtain felt  a little old fashioned ). Hotel rooftop bar was nice."
3866,"If you like hard minimal decor and stark surroundings then this is for you. Although ours was large, the room sizes are incredibly varied and some are tiny, some with no wardrobe space at all. Provision within is minimal too - no kettle or tea making facilities, no iron or ironing board. The bed we found rock hard and very uncomfortable. Bedside tables were minute and very low.  We have to say that the staff were lovely and very helpful and pleasant - one of the hotel's saving graces - the other was its excellent position close to the river and the Louis I bridge."
3867,"Second time at Ruc Hotel for business and everything went perfect. Room 41 was smaller than last time, and near the general rooms entrance. However I haven't noticed any noise and there was enough place for all my stuffs and me. As usual owners were helpful and kind. And there were more fresh fruit at breakfast. I'm just sure to be back in 6 months."
3868,"My husband was staying in the city on business and the company booked this hotel.  The room they gave me had 2 double beds (a king was booked) the bed linens were stained, drapes were dark and dingy and the mesh desk chair had a big hole in it.  I asked for a new room and it was equally as disgusting.  By this point (an hour) I was not going to stay. I started to apologize to the front desk person (named Prissier) and she stopped me to say, she looked at the room and it was fine. Prissier went on to say, she came from a housekeeping background and the room was perfectly clean. I stopped her and said, the lack of customer service was astonishing and I was not in the mood to argue, and would appreciate it if she kept her opinion to herself. Prissier couldn't stop herself from…"
3870,"Hotel average, was ok, not too far from central station and close to Trams stop. Big disappointment once at the reception to check in we've been ask to pay extra euros for the third person which was always included on the original booking. no one informed us prior to that otherwise we could've booked elsewhere."
3871,"We had an exelent stay. Easy to come around with the nearest metro, Alesia. The personell was nice and easy to contact. It was our second stay here. We were staying here also two years ago, and it was still the same nice experience."
3873,"After staying here for years during my annual business trips to China, I have witnessed the quality of staff steadily decline to the point that I will not be back.  Their concierge is a complete joke, unable to recommend a single foot massage place other than the hotel spa. This in Shanghai, perhaps the most famous city in the world for foot massage.  Meanwhile their breakfast staff cannot even pour a simple cup of coffee without assistance, and seem primarily concerned with saying ""hello"" and ""goodbye"" to every guest while doing nothing else useful.  Among other things - Internet speed is a joke - getting ice is nearly impossible - suite with full kitchen, yet not a single dish, utensil or even ice in freezer so really no idea why kitchen is there  "
3874,"Stayed in studio deluxe apartment. So many good things to say about it.  Spacious, 2 cupboards, big walk-in shower, kitchenette with utensils and a supermarket across the street so you can make your own food.   Very modern - has a Smart TV with apps like YouTube so you can watch anything you want! Thought the digital ‘don’t disturb / please make up’ sign was really cool. Also loved the mirror that came out of the desk so I could sit & do my makeup there.  The absolute best thing though about this hotel is the free use of the laundrette. After travelling for 3 weeks already, this made my world. Would stay here again for that alone, but was impressed overall."
3876,"We're not sure whether the standard of accommodation in Mendoza is poor, or whether this hotel has an unfairly high representation on Trip Adviser. Anyway we weren't very impressed. The 'executive' room was basic, dark and had a poor outlook over a car park. There was a more serious problem though. The bathroom had problems with its drains. It smelled terrible. Management agreed and we were moved to another room. This time, at least the smell of the bathroom hadn't completely filled the bedroom. However, each time we had a shower, a smell of sewage permeated the bathroom. And on the subject of the shower, it was pathetically weak.  Breakfast was continental only, nothing hot. Noise-wise, the aircon unit was totally dominating, as was the unit in the room next door. At least the…"
3877,"Its quiet part of Paris and staff is very friendly. Rooms are very clean and quiet. Wi fi is great and free. Great hotel, near to metro station Republic (4 lines has this metro station). Breakfast are great "
3878,"great hotel, great location - walking distance to all the sites, located close to restaurants, bars, cafes and great public transport - wow! The family room with 2 interconnecting rooms was fantastic for our family of 4 and having 2 bathrooms was great! lovely free breakfast each morning and helpful staff. what more could you want?"
3879,"I really enjoyed my stay at the Ekta Hotel in Paris. A warm welcome, modern facilities and a comfortable and quiet room. Great location, literally 2 minutes walk from all the action. I will definitely come back to this friendly, welcoming hotel.  "
3881,"I am here for business along with a few colleagues. The place is under construction but I could look past it. My complaint is that they put me in a conference room and pulled down a bed from the wall. The bed is hard as a rock. They told me the new owners said if the conference room wasn’t rented, they have to put people in it. There is no coffee maker on the room. I don’t appreciate this service and I am not looking forward to staying here. If I weren’t so tired, and am only here one night, I would leave. "
3882,"Read a lot of really good reviews of this hostel and while there was nothing wrong with it  and couldn't fault the staff it was of a lesser quality than a lot of other hostels in Europe. Beds and rooms were a little old, en-suites cramped and hallways and common areas had a bit of a bad smell.  It didn't have the most communal feel like others and because of its size was a bit harder to meet up with people.  For the price you pay I would prefer to stay somewhere more modern next time and a little closer to the main attractions"
3883,"My boyfriend and I stayed for one night and had a surprisingly frustrating time after leaving the hotel. In addition to the $20 hold on the room [which we understood], there was a $90, and two $87.38 charges to my account. We called the hotel Monday to address the issue and it is now Wednesday and it still hasn't' been resolved. This is extremely annoying and this has never happened to us before with any other hotel. We initially booked through Priceline but we were being charged directly from the hotel! Every time we call to get our money refunded, they charge us again for the refunded amount. We typically love staying at Marriott when we travel but from now on, we are looking else where."
3884,"Otherwise a little older hotel, but very good. Location near Zoo and other attractions. Accessible to public transportation. Very good food. The employees are very friendly. Rooms excellent - there is no noise, no sound of other guests or street noise."
3885,"For a hotel at this price level these guys have a long way to go.   While the views over beautiful Rio are spectacular and the hotel has all the amenities to make this a truly great experience for guests, there seemed to be a distinct lack of care for service and attention to detail.   We stayed over the holiday period between Christmas and New Year and booked our stay as a treat. It turned out on arrival there was no food (other than ifood - the Brazilian equivalent of uber eats/ Deliveroo). Hard to order there if you’re not familiar with local restaurants. On new year’s day, we missed breakfast, and didn’t really have any other options to find something to eat. We had to ask for plates and napkins at meals, the breakfast options were fairly limited for a hotel in this price…"
3886,"I love this hotel, I've been here many times with work and came this time with my family. The rooms are small but beautifully done. Breakfast is good and there is a small bar (but no dinner). There is a great pub next door and lots of restaurants and cafes nearby."
3887,"Unfriendly staff,we're shocked when my husband and I walked in,the surprise look on their faces was epic,plus they couldn't find our names on the system and said we probably booked wrongly..just cos we are black..lol ....old furniture,dirty toilet...not worth the cost! There won't be a next time for me. The breakfast was ok,not too many variety.. there were great bars in the neighbourhood where we felt more at home.."
3889,"This hotel normally has a good price, but the area where is located is not attractive at all... the only good thing is that has a Subway station very near, what is really useful to move around Shanghai.  Wifi is annunced as chargeable, but later they told me it was for free.  it has a good gym too, but a little bit dark. You can tell the hotel was opened year ago.  Rooms are big, but they look like old and would need a soon renovation..."
3890,"This is a very decent 4-star hotel in a great location. If your employer lodges you there, don't complain, but you can probably get better places.  The room is small size, even uncomfortably small.  Breakfast is unbelievably boring.  Disappointing."
3891,"The hotel is very central and only a few minutes walk to the castel or the river, perfect for some citytrips.   The rooms are clean and nice in style like the full hotel.  The spa in the sixt flor has an amazing view over the city and very good massages. The stuff there was great!  The breakfast we had included was very good and had a typically portuguese style paired with western selections. We also had dinner in the figus restaurant in the hotel, it was the best in our full trip and also the cheapest 2 bottles of wine and food for 3 pax with starters and seafood for 135.- its a very good offer.  But there also bad experiences at the hotel. At NYE they were fully booked at tje restaurant and we were not able to made a reservation. I can understand thats crowded at this date but…"
3892,"A nice small hotel with friendly welcoming staff, cool rooms (expect no luxuries, but comfortable design and chic details), and in the center of Barcelona. All you need for a few days in town, or even a longer stay."
3893,"My family and I stayed at this hotel. We had reserved 2 nights but ended up canceling one night before hand. As soon as we got to the hotel, the hotel looks old and dirty. I was desperate and wanted to leave ASAP we couldn't leave the same day cause they were not willing to return the deposit or money even though he had checked in 30 min ago and were willing to cancel immediately. I honestly do not recommend this place unless you are traveling in an extreme budget and you don't mind sleeping in a creepy looking room. The rooms are really old and the place is dirty. The lamps were stained, the bathroom wall had blood like stain, the pillow covers were worn out and old, the bedsheets were dirty, and overall the place is disgusting. I have included a few pictures so you guys can…"
3895,Air conditioning is very noisy and you cannot sleep well. People are very attentive and friendly but is not enough. You need to rest when you are back in a hotel. Friendly staff do not replace minimum quality of room.
3896,"I'm writing this as I sit perched on the edge of the bed, which happens to be just inches away from the desk in my closet, I mean ""room"", that I purchased through Priceline at Hotel Felix. I didn't realize until I read another review on TripAdvisor that Hotel Felix likely saves these microscopic rooms just for Priceline customers. The size of the room is a joke - I feel like I'm at a budget hotel in Europe, except that I'm not ... so the fact that I can barely walk around the bed and the ""desk"" is 12 inches deep with no desk chair is unacceptable. The bathroom has a pedestal sink so there is no counter space. Anyone with a tendency toward claustrophobia should steer clear. Priceline should NOT represent this as a four star property if this is the type of room that Hotel Felix…"
3897,"It's very inexpensive and right on the beach, but if you order food from the evening restaurant for room service you will find it is really really bad.  Your hot water might be sketchy, the power in your room might go in and out, the safe in your room is probably broken, the hotel phone might stop working (making it hard to contact the staff with complaints), the air conditioner might have a mind of its own or stop working altogether.  You will be able to hear your neighbors so well it will be as if they are in the same room with you, due to paper-thin walls.  If you call room service with a question like, ""what is today's soup"", and put in a partial order, they'll promise to call you back to answer your question about the soup, but instead, they'll just opt not to call you back and send up just your partial order instead, with the wrong drink.  When you ask the front desk for a wake-up call the next morning and don't receive it, you're never sure if they just were too lazy, forgot, or if the phone stopped working sometime in the wee hours of the morning.  When  you go to order a classic Brazilian cocktail at the somewhat dismal lobby bar, the waiter gives you a grudging look, as if he'd rather being doing anything else.  He then proceeds to wait on everyone else and spend time cleaning up the bar instead of making your drink.  Then, a second wait person behind the bar notices you are being neglected and takes your drink order, after which point, she also decides to start cleaning the bar instead.  It is as if they are attempting to make some kind of silent, passive-aggressive protest to your order of a Caipirinha.  Eventually someone on the managerial level comes by and suddenly the first guy (the one who took your drink order originally) comes around and decides to make the drink after all.  Perhaps the fact that the staff may not allowed to accept tips when you pay with your room card is partially to blame for their attitude.    However, on the flip side, there is one advantage to all this laxity.  On the day you check out, checkout time is officially noon, but if you ask, you will be told that there is a ""maximum tolerance"" of 2:00 PM.  Which basically means you are allowed to stay in a room until someone else is scheduled to check into it.  Guess how much cleaning that room is going to get!  I can imagine the excuse:  ""We are sorry but the previous guest did not leave in time.""  If you really are set on this place here are some tips to improve your experience:     1) Don't eat at the hotel, unless it's the breakfast buffet or the food truck. At the breakfast buffet, meat and cheese are of dubious quality, but the fruit and pastries are usually good.  2) Immediately upon arriving in the room, and before unpacking, check that everything works (lights, electrical outlets, safe, refrigerator, air conditioner, TV, hotel phone, hair dryer).  If anything vital to you is missing, ask for another room.  It could be a long wait to get things fixed.  3) If you are at all sensitive to noise, bring earplugs or noise-cancelling headphones.  The walls are paper-thin, and Brazilians on vacation are loud, and don't understand why everyone doesn't want to join their party.  A room that faces outward (not inwards towards the courtyard) may be quietest, although an ocean view is less likely.  4) Wake-up calls are not guaranteed and no alarm clock is provided.  Bring a travel clock and/or use your phone's alarm to wake up on time.   5) Try to frequent the area bars and cabanas within a short walking distance on the beach for an evening cocktail and meal and avoid the hotel bar.  If you must order at the lobby bar, allow an extra 10 to 15 minutes for sour attitude and poor service.  If you are alone, try to bring something to entertain yourself, such as a book or TV program to watch on your phone, as it may take the wait staff some time to overcome their reluctance to serve you.  6) Consider a later return flight and the possibility of procrastinating as long as possible the time when you must pack your bags and head out, by taking advantage of the ""Maximum Tolerance"" of checkout time at 2:00 PM.  7) Upon your return home, plan to wash EVERYTHING as your clothes will inevitably have a mildew like scent to them, as all the rooms in this hotel are somewhat musty due to the heat and humidity, and the unreliability of the air conditioning…"
3899,It was a great stay. I was busy all day long and came back tired to find a clean nicely decorated room and a comfortable bed.. The room was a bit hot for me but it s within the right limits set by the WHO for bone health. There is a supermarket and a Cafe right down stairs. As well as a masjed right across the street and many halal outlets around. Metro station Birkenstraße is just a 3 minutes walk. And there is a shopping mall about 15-20 mins walk. With a very nice garden full of trees it almost looks like a forest. There are lime stations around for those who favor scooters. The staff were very helpful and friendly. The food in the restaurant was amazing. I invited a couple of friends for dinner and they lived it as well. And the waiters there are extremely polite and…
3900,"We stayed 5 nights in this hotel . The room was brand new , very clean and good equipped. Twice we got 2 bottles  of water for the night. We were a bit surprised that the air conditioning had to be  in service all the time but as there are no windows that can be opened. So in my opinion this was to prevent moisture in the room and to guaranty a good air exchange. The bad point was that the air-co was very noisy even at minimal position. An other bad point was the service in the restaurant during breakfast. The staff was not very friendly, and often did not see the work. On Sunday morning the only disposable bread at 9:45 was some  onion or garlic buns which is a poverty testimony for a 5 star Hotel .  We had one dinner in the Restaurant LUZ. Good food and friendly service. The…"
3902,"If you read my other reviews you will see that I am not harsh - I generally don't give horrible reviews at all and I try to point out the good where I can. This hotel, however, is difficult to find redeeming qualities for - with the exception of location and a few sweet staff members.  The rooms are not at all of ""kimpton"" brand quality, the place is rundown, and looks like someone tried to do ""hip"" on a meager budget and it just looks cheap.  But the piece de resistance is the nighttime noise. I truly cannot describe it. Despite having paid the up-charge for a suite and calling to make sure we purchased the quietest suite we could (we had to wake at 4 to catch a morning flight), we listened to the crashing and beeping of garbage trucks in the alley 6 floors down ALL NIGHT.…"
3903,"We stayed in the hotel in late September. Having stayed at the Brussels Bloom NH Hotel we decided to use a similar hotel. In comparison the Brussels hotel was very much better and we found this hotel disappointing. I would not recommend this location unless you are happy to walk the mile into the centre of Amsterdam. It is very close to the museums , the reason we chose it, and was very quiet, however we always went in to the city to eat etc.. We were given upgraded rooms as the hotel was fully booked. These had lovely full length windows with a good view. The beds were a little hard but other than that no complaints. The entrance to the hotel was not terribly welcoming, or case friendly, and a little shabby. The staff were not terribly helpful. The worst thing was the breakfast…"
3904,They staff was very helpful in arranging restaurants and transportation. It’s a good location for getting to Opera and the Louvre. The 4th floor room was very quiet. The room was a bit warmer during the heat wave. 
3905,"Great location in front of Copacobana beach; however, the hotel is faced with logistical issues: long line-up for check-in as there is no concierge to answer questions, to resolve issues with the bedroom keys, etc.; water in the showers does not drain properly resulting with an accumulation of water on the tiles; dining room is extremely noisy due to poor acoustic choices, and; slow Internet connection. This hotel would rank low amongst the Mercure hotel chain. Moreover, staff is not welcoming. The only advantage of this hotel is location."
3906,"Stayed here a couple of nights with my friend in the 10 pax female dorm and we were expecting a lot based on the past reviews here on TA. However, we left with a little disappointment. The rooms were stuffy but we were lucky to have the fan near our beds so it made our nights much bearable but not too sure about others. Having an ensuite bathroom is great but not so when there is no common toilet so this meant that other girls from the private rooms/mixed dorms were moving in and out, and made it very noisy from 630am onwards. (Doors were creaky as well so you can imagine the hustle and bustle). With all that said, the girls working at the hostel made our stay there very pleasant and fun! They also prepare a huge spread for breakfast and possibly one of the best hostel breakfast…"
3907,"We stayed here for a night and felt the room was quite small. Also the curtain was terrible as it let lots of light in before it was time to get up. The bedding wasn't very soft. All of this is not a big problem, but given the price we paid we felt a bit disappointed.  On the plus side the hotel is right by the tram stop to get into Amsterdam. It's not a long journey at all. All the staff were really nice as well. "
3908,"We stayed for one night, 2 adults and 2 children. The room was small and the beds very uncomfortable. The bathroom was dirty. The uber driver warned us not to go out after dark, it's not the nicest part of town."
3909,Perfectly situated / extremely accommodating staff / GREAT BREAKFAST / stunning rooms and bathrooms / and a great Concierge Doctor on call if so required!! THANK YOU to all the staff at Le Grey for making my stay so comfortable
3910,It’s a decent hotel but could be pricey depending on the season. A little bit of walk from the town (20 mins) with no parking. The room is rather small and looks a bit dull but then it’s an Easyhotel that you can only expect so much from it.
3912,"So pleased we found the Hotel Simone, first class for friendly staff, comfortable accommodation and cleanliness. Perfectly situated near the main railway station and buses. We stayed bed and breakfast, worth the extra money lots of fresh croissants and Danish pastries plus ham, cheese, fruit and yoghurts as well as fresh juices and hot drinks. The hotel is conveniently close to the shops, local eateries and only a 5 minute walk from La Croisette. Would also recommend a visit to the old town too with its beautiful little streets. Hotel Simone is a great base to explore if you want to, we visited Monaco and Antibes. If you are unsure about getting from the airport we would recommend catching the 210 coach from just outside the airport for 33 euros return. I would definitely…"
3913,"I was traveling through California and changed 6 hotels. This hotel was the most expensive, the smallest room and one bathroom for the level. There was horrible smell in the hotel and in the restaurant below, bed was extremely small and not comfortable at all. There was one single bed and one double bed in the room and around 30-35 cm between them, one bedside table and stinking wardrobe (we didn't use it because of smell)."
3914,"The location is very good for business meets. The rooms are lovely and has a nice view outside.  It is very good for a quiet night's sleep.  (Lovely birds singing outside in the morning to give a bright start.)  Breakfast was very good.  Above all, the hostess made the stay as if it was a family stay.  She was waiting to receive me with a smile, even though my flight was delayed.   Absolutely recommended!"
3915,Very welcoming and clean. Only a few minutes walk to and from the train station. Staff were very polite and helpful. Room was clean and beds were comfortable. There's a spacious kitchen with a fridge and an area to cook. Overall great experience and great atmosphere. Highly recommended :)
3916,"Ideal location, near Potszamer Platz and Berlin Mall and within a half hour walk to other major tourist attractions. Rooms tick all boxes. Staff friendly and helpful.  We had a problem with our taxi and staff were happy to help.  Accessible  room for our son was very spacious."
3917,"We used Hyatt downtown Chicago for our wedding block and had a terrible experience - delayed check in way past the “guaranteed” time, poor parking policy for photography and hair/makeup, they didn’t follow through on agreed payment options, and the follow up afterward was a chore. They also were doing construction outside our room at 6am on New Years Eve that was loud. "
3918,"Stayed here for a convention at Moscone Center. Arrived and checked in to find out that they overbooked rooms and even though I booked a king room I was given room with 2 queens. Why make a reservation then? Location was fine aside from a decent amount of homeless people who hang around that area. Upon checking out, the mgr on duty proceeded to tell me that the room was not paid for even though it was booked 2 months prior on corporate credit card. I had original reservation as well as receipt under my door that morning showing zero balance. She was rude, insulting to my husband and very confrontational when questioned. She could not even provide a proper Marriott authorization form but made me write down the corporate credit card number again on blank piece of paper. I think…"
3920,My husband and I enjoyed staying at Jack's Hotel in Paris's 13th arrondissement. The rooms are of a good size and the rooms on the upper floors have views. The bathroom facilities are good. The hotel is very close to Place d'Italie. The staff were very helpful and welcoming.
3922,"Great contact via mail prior the trip. All the codes for entrance/room door/luggage room/wifi provided before my arrival. The location is great, close to the Central Station and to the old town. Everything within walking distance.   Staff was average, not unfriendly but not welcoming either. I couldn't check in earlier but at least I could leave my luggage and take a shower. The room was ok but there were barely sockets and in weird places so it was hard to charge anything. There were no sockets in bathrooms either which was a huge problem.  Wifi connection was fine. The hostel is not handicapped-friendly as the minute you open the main door there is a very steep staircase.  Good for one-night stay but I think it'd be suitable for multiple nights too."
3923,"Second visit to this hotel, clean as ever check in ok experience seemed a little cold this time around the first time felt more welcoming maybe time of night. Room was twin mattresses pushed together didn't really like that made do as no other rooms available. "
3924,"Look past the novelty of this hotel.  2 showers doors don’t lock, cheap and unpleasant toilet roll, basic bedrooms. The breakfast experience is poor. Choice is low and they bring multiple orders in one basket. Our order was wrong and they didn’t apologies but told our friends they were wrong - a no no for any customer service. Seems to lack experienced management.  Positives - funky original design 👍 I would recommend paying a bit more for a ‘normal’ hotel in the city centre."
3927,I booked this hotel threw priceline.com and what a mistake that was. I got the room for $110 a night. It said it was 16% savings. Not a great savings but that is the chance I took. Then I went on there web page on the price was $98 a night! I called priceline.com and was told they have a lowest price guarantee. I was happy with that. They went on to the webpage and could see that the price was indeed $98 a night. So then he said he put the dates in and there are no rooms available so he cant confirm the price. WHAT? The price is right in front of your face! This does reflect badly on Aston as well. They partnered up with Priceline and I paid $110 a night for something they are charging $98 for. I have not been to Aston yet... that trip is coming up but I already have a bad taste…
3928,"Room was very nice but also very dark.  I think brighter bulbs or better lamps are needed.  I was very comfortable and the bath area was excellent.  I could not find an extra electrical outlet or USB port in my room.  I moved a bench and did see some, but it was too awkward to crawl around on the floor.  I just unplugged my bedside lamp and charged my phone and camera there.  Had dinner in their restaurant, elegant but not out of the ordinary.  The breakfast buffet looks awesome, but nothing was hot enough.  Coffee was tepid.  Actually, The buffet is packed with carbohydrates and had few healthy choices.  They had yogurt, which I had.  This place actually looks better than it actually is."
3929,"We read so many great reviews of this place before we got here, unfortunately we got disappointed... First of all the management should take a look at there staff, as they are high all the time and not helpful at all. The beds are not comfy, really hard feels like laying on the ground. We also booked a tour through the hostel to go visit the sand dunes etc, everything was supposed to be included but during the tour we had to pay entrance for getting in to the white sand area, no one had given us any info about that. There is also a lot of mice running around in the common area. Beach is nice, the place has a good vibe to it and the restaurant/bar has a lot to offer. But unfortunately the staff brought the experience down. "
3931,We were so excited to find rooms with air conditioning last minute as the temperatures in Paris soar up to 107. Our room was very nice and spacious for an European hotel. It was recently updated and our in room bathroom very modern. I skipped their breakfast and walked to a nearby pastry shop. I ate in their small private court yard taking in the neArby residential French morning sounds.   I love this location as you are 3 miles from the heart of Paris and can easily catch the subway or the bus. Plus this is a nice residential street without any tacky touristy attractions. Plus you arent paying outlandish prices to be in an American chain.   The staff spoke many languages including English.   Notes:  -each time you leave the building they have you return the key to the front…
3932,"Can't comment on the standard of accommodation at the Greenwich Inn as we never actually got to stay there.  We had booked our three night stay (and paid our deposit) at this hotel weeks in advance.   After an eight hour train journey, we arrived to check in at around 11pm.  The guy in reception proceeded to take the outstanding balance payment from my partner, and then told us that they actually didn't have any spare rooms due to 'renovation works' so we would be staying at another hotel (Presidio Inn - which is another review for another day!) a few blocks away...  Of course he waited until we had paid to reveal this, which is obviously shady as hell. The renovation work was clearly planned, so they must have known they wouldn't have enough rooms for the number of bookings…"
3933,I was only able to get 1 hr of sleep because of all the police activity outside. The area was literally abuzz with sporadic police sirens until 3am! I was exhausted the next day. Not such a good thing considering that I was running the San Francisco Marathon. The location of the hotel doesn't justify its price tag.
3934,"We really loved this hotel. The staff was very helpful, especially Rafael. He took time while checking in to make sure we had everything we needed and answered many questions for us. The rooms were comfortable and the location was great. Close to many restaurants and shopping and close to mass transit."
3935,"Fresh boutique environment with welcoming touches—cookies and sweets in the lobby—the latest technology, comfortable room with thoughtful features. The room was sweltering hot, on an evening in October. Cranking down the a/c didn’t help. The elaborate lighting design had a downside. After I turned off all lights and fell into bed exhausted, the lights turned back on at about 10-minute intervals. I called the front desk to ask what to do (about 11 pm) but no one answered. Finally the lights stopped their dance. A costly hotel where you can’t get a decent night’s sleep has some work to do.  On the bright side, the restaurant has a great chef and excellent service."
3937,"I stayed in a 6 bed dorm which felt way too cramped once there were actually 6 people staying in it, the whole room was very narrow and laid out in such a way that the sunlight from the window didn't even shine on one of the beds so we had to keep the overhead lights on at all times. Additionally the shower in the bathroom spilled water all over the floor so it was awkward to try to shower and also get dressed in there afterwards. It's a perfectly functional hostel, and would be fine for a couple of nights, but there's probably better available in Stockholm."
3938,"Nothing terrible about hotel but they mistakenly booked us for only 1 night instead of three.  Had to spend part of our vacation day packing and finding a new hotel and not being able to do anything until new hotel was found.  And since checkin isn't until 3pm, we wasted half a day.  "
3939,We stayed in this hotel from May 8-11 2019. We arrived by train and it was only a 2 stop tram ride to the hotel. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was beautifully designed and included a balcony overlooking the courtyard. We could walk to many major tourist sites including the Reichstag and Berlin Wall Memorial. The S Bahn and U Bahn as well as trams were easily accessible. We really enjoyed our stay and have no hesitation in recommending it as a great place to stay in Berlin. The Vietnamese restaurant next door was excellent as was the Schnitzel restaurant recommended by the staff. Make a reservation. It’s always busy.  The only problem was the air circulation in the room. It was very warm. Staff told us this would be addressed this summer. 
3940,"The outside of the hotel presented nicely, but from the lobby on in, the hotel just stunk.  Carpets, hallways, and even the unswept and nasty stairwells--it all just stunk.    The room itself was small, the reading lamp above the bedside was broken off and just hanging, the floors hadn't been mopped in who knows how long (I mopped up an accidental spill and the towel turned black, that's how I know that), and there was grass growing in thru the bottom of the outside windows.    The tub was nasty, as if never cleaned between guests, and the wall heater was turned on, blowing hot air throughout  the room--I even had to get someone come to the room twice to turn it off and turn the A/C on (since it was in the high 80's that day).  The ONE ice machine in the hotel was naturally on…"
3942,"I stayed at this hotel in March/April of 2013, but I remember my experience very well. It was a great value. A bit far from the city center (about a 5-10 minute walk to the train that would take you there) but it had an park on the same street that me and my friends got some cool pictures in and an amazing Doner place also at the end of the street.   The hotel itself was warm and inviting and the rooms were clean. The shared bathroom situation is never ideal, but the hotel was very slow because of the season and we did not have to deal with a lot of people in the bathrooms in the morning.  The lobby contains a nice bar with a good selection of well-priced drinks that me and my friends enjoyed sitting at and speaking with the friendly bartenders.  All in all, I would definitely…"
3943,When we got to the hotel the staff tried to put our party of 6 in one room.  Explaining that we would have a good time.  They thought we were swingers. We were very offended. Even though we are swingers we'd ordered three rooms not one suite. They also wouldn't make the drinks we wanted because they couldn't be bothered. The hotel is good looking and the food is good. 
3944,"Location is very good, there are two metro station just 200 meters walking and it needs just 10 minutes to got to main touristic attractions. Also area where hotel is located is very food, a lot of shops and bars. Hotel itself is quite good, interesting design in Inka style. Rooms are bright and big, bed is very comfortable. Stuff is nice. Recommend to stay in 1K."
3946,"After weeks on the road, it was fabulous to arrive at our Brilliant apartment, Rubin. Finally, a place to rest, comfortably. The rooms are huge, well designed furnishings and layout, very clean and with a slightly funky, contemporary feel. Not the boring, staid, cookie-cutter hotel room that get very boring and forgettable after weeks away. It felt like a home, actually better than home!  We had stayed in Prenzlauberg before, so knew it was a great location. Oderberger Strasse is the best street, too. Great restaurants, shops, and a supermarket at the end of the street. It's a dead end, so minimal traffic and quiet, even though it is around the corner from the busy restaurant and excellent shopping strip on Kastienallee. Very close to trains, trams and easy access to everywhere…"
3947,Great location  Room fair Customer service not so much Why stay when there are thousands of choices in Chicago?  The employees don’t care if your there or not.   I stay in hotels all over the world and there is little engagement on staffs part to make a great stay for the customer 
3948,"It was very, very difficult to sleep. A fire station is outside my window. The sirens keep going off.  There is a lot of noise & loud talking in the hallway outside my room at midnight. The hallways seem to reverberate/magnify the noise.   And the bed is rock hard with very polyester-like linens. I could manage with the linens, but the comfort is zero.   I am miserable here and expect more from a Hampton Inn.   Staff at front desk at check in was very well prepared, knowledgeable and polite."
3949,"We arrived to a warm welcome from Stefan and Brigitte but for only one confirmed night. The city was full. We (two older Kiwis) needed three nights. Stefan said leave it to me, we will find something. By the next morning we had our next two nights confirmed. Thank you Stefan. Our room was delightful and kinky with high class graffiti art on the walls. Spotlessly clean. Breakfasts were delicious and varied. Can highly recommend, good value for money."
3950,"Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights with my mum. We arrived well before check in & on the website it says if you arrive before check in there is a fee per hour for checking in early however this was not possible. We did however get a free upgrade to a junior suite.  Of all the hotels I have been to this has been the most underwhelming. In our room there was 1 small mirror situated beside the wardrobe. Within our bathroom the lights kept on turning off due to the sensors not sensing us in there. The rooms are minimalistic with various patches on the floor.  The only reason why Ive given this 3 stars is because of the hospitality of the restarts staff. The breakfast was very nice and the staff were lovely.   The spa has 2 saunas, a steam room and a pool. There is no jacuzzi.  …"
3951,"We are staying at this hotel at present and  they are building all around the hotel. There has been a jack hammer going most of the week between 9am and 6pm so sitting by the pool or in our room is hardly relaxing! We refused to accept the first room we were given as it had a pile of rubble and blocks at the rear of the patio! We were given no notification of the work taking place which is why I am writing this review to warn others to check. On a positive note the hotel is clean, the staff are usually helpful and the food is excellent. "
3952,"First of all, the hotel is situated on the hillside, nearly similar to all other ""cave dug"" sites, eg. half of the hotel is within the mountainside, and uses tunnels to connect parts of it, which are great, unless you are 6'3 and hit your head on everything. Overall, I was expecting a Ritz-Carlton type atmosphere, which the Kirini fell short of. The Spa is exceptional, as I would have hoped, but other areas of the hotel did not meet my expectations. Breakfast is underwhelming, ""healthy"" section consisted of a nature valley trail mix bar full of sugar and carbs, not exactly what I  was looking for. Wait staff was helpful, but food is incredibly overpriced, expect to spend $15 on a cocktail by the pool or $20 for a burger. The pool is unique, but all the sunbeds aren't as comfy as…"
3953,Unfortunately although this is a beautiful hotel we had problems with both service and maintaintance that negatively impacted our stay.  We were celebrating my wife's birthday so splurged on this hotel at 639 euros for 2 nights.  Imagine our surprise when we walked into our beautiful suite to the distinctive odor of septic.  When we immediately told the woman at the front desk she seemed to question?doubt our ability to smell septic by simply saying she had been in that room twice that day and didn't notice any foul odors.  Rule number 1 in customer service is before you dispute your customer perhaps you should at least investigate the problem.  She then offered us a different room with no heat. At that point the other receptionist (Ana) came with us to the room and immediately…
3954,"best - all o.k. super Location, fine breakfast, clean rooms, friendly personal, super Connections to öffis, low noise, Price o.k., good Partner for dinners, Restaurant quadro is top, coffee very good,   "
3955,"I brought two students to this location for the Midwest Clinic. I like the connection to McCormick place. There is no leaving anywhere to get to the convention. I do not like the price of food...especially for high school students who do not have a lot of parental support. I get charging business professionals that much, but we just went to Target and got breakfast food after we found out the breakfast buffet was $22.00 for a mostly basic continental breakfast that would be free with room in other establishments."
3956,Great Location to transportation and sights.  Room was modern and comfy and the breakfast was fantastic.  We love being able to get the coffee we want with the machines right there.  Staff was friendly and professional!
3957,A cozy hotel with very good staff and excellent service. The staff were very helpful friendly and would give advise on every request. We returned from a short visit at 12 midnight and they were ready to serve us sandwiches even though the restaurant was closed. The front desk girl even went in to the kitchen and brought out plates to serve us the sandwiches. Will definitely come back to visit this hotel.
3958,"I liked the small touches at this hotel - cup of tea on arrival, free mini bar with cookies and drinks in, the toiletries and a reasonably good selection for breakfast.  However the big issue with this hotel was with the room. I was given a twin room despite traveling on my own and telling reception about this when checking in. Had I been travelling with someone there was a lack of privacy as the shower had a glass wall to the bedroom, with a blind that wouldn't have kept you covered.  The MAIN issue was how cold my room was in the night. There was a window in the room that wouldn't close and hence the temperature dropped down to about 16 degrees through the night! The only way to stop this from happening was to turn on the very noisy heating system. Neither option bodes well…"
3959,Photshopped pictures are not necessarry but always nicer then reality.  Management should not allow this. The restaurant offers good quality but is not special and therefore asks to much money. The bistro offers good value nad the breakfast was excellent. The personel is very helpfull and friendly.
3960,"Brilliant an welcoming staff at all times during our stay!  Location was perfect, close to all public transport links whilst also a short walk away from attractions/shopping. Room was cleaned daily and more than ideal for us"
3961,"I had such high hopes for the Queen Ann. I was traveling to a new city each night on business, and lucky for me, my company made reservations at some really amazing B&Bs!  I was looking forward to the last night on my mystery tour that ended at the Queen Ann in San Francisco. Especially since it came recommended, and, high off my stay at the Amber House in Sacramento, I was ready for a wonderful stay in one of my favorite cities.   To be honest, I have two minds about my brief experience at the Queen Ann, and hesitated to write a negative review.  On one hand, for those into pseudo-Victorian style and paranormal experiences, the Queen Ann is probably everything they hoped for.   On the other, overwrought, poorly maintained original period furniture, deeply unappealing décor and…"
3962,Fresh flowers in rooms were a lovely surprise.  Rooms however are very tired with less than efficient air conditioning.  Customer service staff was a hit and miss affair.  Some fantastic and couldn't do enough for you while others made you feel you were inconveniencing them.  Restaurant on site was seldom open.  On one occasion when it was the service was poor.
3963,"My partner and I are real history geeks and were looking forward to a much needed weekend away in Berlin. I booked us the Sir Savigny which is in charlottenberg. About an Hour by train from Schoenfield airport but only about 20 minutes to Alexderplatz (city centre) by train and a ten/15 minute walk to the big Zoo area which is another city centre kind of. The hotel is immaculate, it smells great as soon as you walk in. It's has really amazing decor. we got a free drink on arrival (orange for us as we don't drink but you can get anything you want). we got upgraded to the top floor in the only room that had a balcony - RESULT! absolutely gorgeous room. The bed...OH MY GOD... 11/10. so comfortable. I even took a pic of the tag so I can source the bedding for myself. I couldn't…"
3964,"I travel in nha-trang couples times, i've been visiting numbers of hotel but this one is the worst ever, “fast” wifi ever, breakfast is nice and delicious but seem no one fill coffee for us unless we ask for help. The room look new but out of date design and late cleaning room daily. Hotel staff ‘s nice and helpful.  Hotel offers good price but you receive what you pay for. There is plenty of nice hotel in Nha-Trang but i definitely NOT RECOMMENDING THIS ONE."
3965,"We arrived at the Millennium Knickerbocker for our reserved 3 night stay and at first glance the lobby was very nice. Our first clue to the contrary was when we walked up to the reservation desk.  We were greeted by a male clerk with very long, dirty fingernails.  Not the end of the world, but as I say, ""first clue"".  After we were checked in at the desk and our bags loaded onto a bellhop cart, we were greeted by the assistant manager on duty, who although was very courteous, not very well kept.  He proceeded to tell us that ALL elevators on the property were broken and that he would need to escort us through the kitchen into a service elevator. When I inquired as to why ALL the elevators were down at the same time, we were told that the service was ""in house"" and it was a slow…"
3966,"I checked in at 11:30 pm by a male receptionist and I totally was not welcomed with a cold face from the staff. Most of my requests were responded “no, can not “. I did not expected him to say yes but at least he should show me he has tried to help however he did not. After 5’ check in, I got no any information about my breakfast time, location ..., wifi, benefits or any facilities. I was only asked to sign one registration form for 2 rooms then he gave the key and showed the lift. The room was with a connecting door but it is not cover properly and I had heard the noise from the next door until 2 am then I called the receptionist and he said that the room type I booked is connecting door which never been shown on reservation. It is worse when he said the next door is Vietnamese…"
3967,"I stayed here a few weeks ago and had a horrible experience. On the last night of our stay, a group of teenagers/young adults ran up and down the halls screaming all night. Really, from around 9:30 until 3 or 4 in the morning, yelling and screaming down the hall. We called about these guests during the night, along with two other rooms, to try and get someone to do something about it. Unfortunately for us, when security(?) finally got them to go back into their room, it was right next to ours and they continued to yell for another hour or so. Walls are very thin so we could hear quite a bit of what was going on. When we checked out the next morning, the person at the front desk just seemed over it. He really didn't seem to care at all that we had such a terrible experience. For…"
3968,"A very comfortable stay for family of 5 very close to more expensive hotels but for considerable lower cost. Excellent wifi, shower, air conditioning. Helpful and available front desk. Some street noise and neighbors can be loud in stairwell, but no complaints otherwise. Small set of stairs to elevator. Very happy with the accommodations. "
3969,"I experienced the same issue regarding over billing for my hotel stay resulting in my credit card being charged between $450 and $678 each day that I stayed at the hotel including up to 3 days after check out. I spoke to a manager each day who ensured me that the issue was taken care of; consequently, I re-experienced the same issue each day. The level of incompetence by the guest services staff is unreal at this point. As a result, I will not ever stay at this hotel again nor recommend anyone to stay here."
3970,Conveniently located near U-Bahn station in the downtown of West Berlin. Good connection with Berlin airport. Restaurants and shopping places are nearby. Breakfast spread is adequate. Room is clean but outdated. Staff are courteous.
3972,"The Hotel Palace Berlin is located in a super spot - opposite the zoo and aquarium, tucked in between shopping malls, surrounded by an endless selection of eateries and around almost every corner is history.   The hotels’ staff are welcoming, helpful and knowledgeable. Rooms are a very comfortable size with most things you can think of provided for you. The public areas are open and airy and you are able to relax with a glass of something chilled from the bar or head to the gin club and be overwhelmed with the selection. There is a fair range of food to choose from or in the restaurant. Breakfast is a huge array of everything you could want - stay healthy with the fruits and toughest through to the other end of the scale and have pancakes with maple syrup! Breakfast chef is…"
3973,"The positives about this hotel are the location, the staff are very pleasant and the speed of taxis once ordered by the hotel. The common areas are clean and fresh too. The hotel looks beautiful from the outside.  Unfortunately, once you get inside, there are no frills; It is very much like a very slightly 'posher' Travelodge or budget hotel. There is no bar... drinks are served by the receptionist from a tiny 'bar' next to the reception desk and the choice is virtually nil. There is no separate bar / lounge.. just a few chairs and sofas in the reception (it looks nice but it's not comfortable to sit and have a drink).  There is no room service or bar menu at all.. just a few ready wrapped sandwiches and a vending machine on offer. If you get back from work late and don't want…"
3974,"I left the hotel only to realize later that I left an item in my room.  As several hours had passed and I know my room would have been cleaned I called the hotel to help me find out if they found my item and I could pay to have it returned to me.  The hotel operator and the front desk could not help me.  I was transferred to the risk management department and received voicemail during business hours.  I left a message and called back several days later and again voicemail.  A week later, still no response and I called during business hours and again transferred to voicemail after pleading to speak with someone versus voicemail. I then called back and asked for Mark Huntley the hotel manager or an assistant manager that could help me as voicemail was not helpful to me.  I was…"
3976,Not really value for money compared to other options. Although reception staff are friendly it was frustrating to arrive 2 hours after check in time after a long journey and be told our room was not ready!! Then when leaving to be told they cannot extend the checkout time at all when we had a flight delay!Breakfast is great but service is functional rather than friendly. Limited facilities (nice small lobby lounge but that’s all); no real room service if you want a drink and nothing available after 2am. So overall OK but have stayed in better value hotels in Amsterdam. 
3978,"The location of this hotel is awesome, close to Checkpoint Charlie and walking distance to so much of what we wanted to see during our visit to Berlin. The suite we had was enormous, which was wonderful for a family of five after a 5-hour train ride from Salzburg."
3979,"This was a VERY bad experience for us. The room smelt rancid. We were not able to change rooms since the hotel was sold out. The shower was dirty upon arrival.  Valet was extremely rude, they were very aggressive in trying to get a tip. they would highjack the keys.  "
3980,"when we first entered we were met by receptionist  could have been a bit more welcoming,night girl fab, However the place was very clean and quite quirky The stairs are steep not for the faint hearted,"
3982,We had four nights here and hardly slept. If you couldn't hear people outside on the street it was other hotel guests talking and slamming the doors. The rooms are very big and clean. Steep stairs. Nice staff 
3983,Easy to find due to central location.  Very good breakfast and friendly staff to work with online and in person.  Traditional small European property that included everything the site stated.  The beds were comfortable and the noise level was nonexistent with the windows closed.  Tight quarters but we knew that in advance.
3984,"Nothing very fancy here, but the place has some real assets: big room (437), bath and shower, king bed, room darkens nicely, quiet, and great neighborhood for restaurants, transit, and museums.  We stayed here five nights, visiting the Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh Museum, Modern Art Museum, Vondelpark, and some really outstanding small restaurants very close by.  Hotel downsides: it caters to tour groups so it's not an intimate place, there's no concierge, thermostat was broken and the room overheated, and the cleaning crew kept taking our hung up towels (disregarding green rules).  Very nice looking restaurant which we didn't use. Not a bad place but we probably wouldn't return since there are so many nice looking options in the area."
3985,"Acceptable service, I have nothing to say. Hotel well located and close to everything, shops, restaurants, transport. I just did not like the bathroom, it was not practical and it easily gets water out."
3986,"Madiera is a lovely place. However the Pestana Grand was disappointing for us. We stayed on recommendation from friends. We travelled with our 3 children, and found that this hotel had nothing much for the kids to do. The pools were freezing and in the indoor pool we were made to feel like a nuisance as the other guests did not like the children splashing. The staff on the breakfast duty were brilliant. Full of smiles, interacted with the children and helped with your every need. However other staff members struggled to crack a smile. Overall it was an ok stay. "
3987,"The Hotel was nice , clean and comfy, really helpful staff , we had a great breakfast over there !! Also really easy to get to Eiffel Tower from the location and you’ve got so many restaurants around , you’ll just need to pick one ! ☺️ Really pleased of the hotel , I would go again 👌🏻"
3988,"I stayed three nights in a very musty room. I awoke my first morning to someone knocking on someone's door at 5:30 in the morning, calling out ""Room Service"". Could not get a good night's sleep at all."
3989,"Rooms were very spacious and since we were on the 24th floor the view was amazing ! You could look over all of Barcelona. We were given complimentary half bottle of cava and a birthday brownie cake (which was delicious ) due to celebrating a birthday . The mini bar was restocked daily with complimentary drinks (1 of each - beer, water, sparkling, lemonade and coke) and it is big enough to cool your own drinks . You are right outside a shopping mall which is convenient for calling for anything you forgot or a morning coffee, we stopped off at the supermarket which was inside for beers and wine to drink before going out ! We didn’t use much of the facilities in the hotel but there was plenty on offer with having an indoor pool and outdoor.  The only cons we experienced was the…"
3990,"We had great 3 nights at the hotel!!! The place is very clean and the staff is friendly and helpful. We highly recommend this place for it’s location in the city. The metro station is near and many places are in walking distance.  There is a lovely Nespresso coffee machine and water bottles for free at the lobby. We will absolutely come back on our next visit to Barcelona.  P.S- the room acoustic is not that good, if you are staying at a room that is located in the middle of the hotel and that doesn’t have a balcony, you can hear the noise of the water going down in the middle of the hotel."
3991,"On arrival at the hotel our room wasn't ready which was fine and expected as we we early but the last on reception was a bit all over the place and didn't give the best first impression.   The hotel is nicely decorated and the staff are helpful. The rooms are nice and clean, ours however was a little small.  There are lots of nice touches such a wine and cheese on arrival (the most wine and cheese we saw at the suites during our stay despite the name) and little cakes left in your room at night.  However, these little touches are nice but inconsistent. We saw our neighbours receives a wee parcel on their last evening. We did not receive anything. Lovely to do things like this but if it's not a consistent service it feels a little disappointing, particularly when we stayed for a…"
3992,"The breakfast was great and filling. Our room really fit our needs. Just know that this Adina does not have a swimming pool, if that is important. Wasn't for us. Staff was always helpful, friendly and patient. "
3993,"The Hotel Myers is located in a convenient spot in Berlin.  Restaurants and transportation are just a short walk from the hotel.  The rooms are very attractive and each of them is individually furnished.  Ours had a king bed, a jacuzzi tub, a rain shower.  In addition there was plenty of space to sit in our room.  The hotel is decorated uniquely.  Lots of artwork as you enter the hotel.  It has a nice garden with sculpture pieces.  We enjoyed a glass of wine in the garden after exploring museum island.  This is a great place to recharge after a long day of touring Berlin."
3994,"First the positive points. The room was very clean and I had daily battles with the cleaning lady (no matter where I put my towels, I got fresh ones and my papers and food was moved across the table because it had to be cleaned).   There was a huge breakfast that I barely used, but it was there. Fresh fruits, juice, different types of bread. In the evening you could eat at the restaurant I believe or at the place out back, we ate at the place outside. It was fine, not great, but good enough.  Yes, it takes some time to go to the center of Berlin, but those 15 minutes are hardly a downer on your vacation. It is annoying that the trams only take cash. The hotel personel is happy to assist you with getting to the shopping center and taking the right trams or busses.  My friend also…"
3995,"Receptionist was very kind upon arrival. Was able to hold luggage on the day of check out. The location was amazing, so close to the arc de triomphe. There’s a bunch of shops close by a supermarket and halal option too on the same street. The room however was small considering it was a superior. Photos are not a great reflection of size. But very very clean. "
3996,"Arrived here for a 4 night stay in Berlin: Easy access to the near by trains and the location of the hotel is handy for nearby attractions. Breakfast was simple and filled you for the day. Staff are lovely and welcoming when you arrive down for breakfast and when you enter after a long day out. Room was replaced with fresh towels everyday. Little cards at reception helped us plan our time in Berlin and certainly helped us find the best places to eat. Only fault I have is that we were given two single duvet covers for a double bed and none of the sheets were changed while we were here but then again, we only stayed for four days so wasn't a massive deal."
3997,"The bath directly inside the small room is not really seperated.   Floor can be wet....illumination of room too difficult.....breakfast was ok but you have to wait, withiut any sense, until service  personal give you a seat...."
3998,"According to US standards, this hotel can not be more than a 2-star. The hotel is old and recently changed to Golden Tulip (previously known as the Luxor Continental). I booked a standard room. The room was clean but not to my satisfaction. Perhaps due to the fact that the public areas of my floor were not clean and there was this funny smell because ventilation was very poor in the hallways. I was in the 10th floor and the room was very noicy at night, windows handles were missing and you could here street noice quite loudly. Half of the elevators were not working during the days I stayed.  However, the worst disadvantage of the hotel is the location: lots of drug addicts and prostitutes right in front of the hotel giving a sense of insecurity. Also, the hotel is located at the…"
3999,"It's in a very convenient place if you are using the train or the Tegel airport. It's in an undeveloped area of Berlin, so you need to take the public transport to go anywhere interesting. There was no kettle or cups in the room. I wish there was something for the guests to make some hot drinks in the room."
4000,"Clean place just to sleep.Very bad towels.You must stay in opposite side of disco, or you'll never sleep weel (if you have headfones or ear protectors, maybe you can get some sleep if you stay in bedrooms in front of the disco, that is across the street)"
4001,"The hotel is new, modern, and beautiful.  The location is a bit far from the main area but if you don't mind walking and if you prefer quiet, this is a good hotel.  However, the wifi not working was a HUGE pet peeve of mine.  They tried to fix but never worked properly for my 3 nights there.  Also, the room's air/heating unit made a noise that I didn't like, and this is after I turned the unit OFF.  I had some trouble sleeping because of this.  Upon checking out I asked the front desk manager to do something for me such as comping me for 1 night's stay, for example, since sleeping well is a BIG part of staying at a hotel, especially at a bucket list destination!   He has yet to contact me and I don't expect he will.  The breakfast was average, although at first glance it looked…"
4002,"We stayed here for two nights in April and were really happy. Service is good and freindly. Room is clean and well organited. Unfortunately there is no body cream or hair conditioner (but you can buy one at the reception  :)) Could not evaluate the food - we did not have breakfast. But in the room we got tea, coffe, drinks for free."
4003,"This used to be my ""go to"" location in Chicago and have stayed there too many nights to count.  It has now gone ""United"" on me by gauging me for a full rate overnight when I asked for an early check out.  I had expected that leaving at 1:45 in the afternoon would have been accommodated especially since I am SPG Gold status.  The manager, William, went out of his way not to go out of his way and the experience was undeserved and unappreciated."
4004,"First, the things we (my wife & I) liked about Outrigger Waikiki Beach resort: Our room was very nice & clean, the hotel is literally right on the beach, staff are very friendly & helpful, service is excellent. There's a convenience store in the lower lobby that is pretty well-stocked, with relatively reasonable prices (for a resort). The restaurants & the little deli off the lower lobby serve good food, although their menus are somewhat limited. The buffet breakfast at Duke's is excellent. If you like high-end shopping, this is the place. Pretty much every high-end retail chain you ever heard of is within easy walking distance, as are a lot of good chain restaurants. (My suggestion: Have at least one meal at Roy's, which is a few blocks away. Expensive but superb.)  Here's what…"
4005,"The hotel is very good indeed, despite being huge. The breakfast is really wonderful and complete, to all tastes. Gluten free, lactose free, etc. the staff is great. All of them very kind and professional. The room was big and very comfortable. It’s located in one of the more central part of the city, with a underground/metro station in just 5 meters from the door. Besides, close to Potsdamerplatz, and Berlim mall. A very nice hotel."
4006,"This is a very clean, basic hotel, automated check in and out. Out of town but close to airport and 15mins into town centre. Serves basic food, good breakfast and staff are friendly. Point to note it is an alcohol free hotel."
4007,"Stayed for three nights and the hotel was clean and tidy. The breakfast buffet was good, but nothing exceptional - although the coffee was good.  A down side was the bar at the hotel was tiny and lifeless and it needed a bit more zip. Also though there is a hot tub on the roof terrace the water in it was anything but hot!  The hotel is next to its parent hotel and I suspect the plan is that your supposed to use the facilities there and I did use the pool and spa and it was excellent.  On the whole I would recommend and would return"
4009,"We've stayed here in the past and have had good experiences but our last stay felt like a fleece job.   The place is on Lake Tahoe and has wonderful views and a private beach. The rooms have great wood burning fireplaces which are great on cold winter nights.Those are the pluses. Unfortunately, they don't appear to have updated the rooms in many years. That's years of snow, sand and water being tracked through the rooms which have caused significant issues with floors and walls. Our room had a plugged shower, broken towel rack and a fire alarm wrapped in plastic to name a few problems. At $270 a night they could have at least inspected the rooms. The beds have to be at least 5 years old, my side was indented by all the bodies having slept there before me.  They did give us a…"
4010,"This property is very well located, near-ish to Museum Island, close to a U-bahn station, supermarkets, and in-house restaurants. (Those walking to MI need to be aware, there is a huge construction site in between, which necessitates a detour of a couple of blocks in either direction.) It is basically a hotel with apartments. Technically this is the case,  but for those planning to do any more than heat up a meal or make tea and coffee, the kitchen is small and ill-equipped. There were two each of all crockery and cutlery items (i.e. two mugs, large and small plates, bowls etc.). So plan on running the dishwasher every day (you will have to ask for tablets). Items such as a chopping board are not provided, and we couldn't get a toaster. The latter wasn't an issue in practice as…"
4011,Booked a king room pretty sure we ended up with a 1 bed double. No tea/coffee facilities in the room or in the lobby. We had to travel 20 floors to get to Starbucks which isn’t convenient when you want to relax in bed on your vacation. There was room for such facilities but I guess having a mini bar makes them more money. There was no wardrobe of any kind in the room to hang clothes which isn’t good enough for the cost of the room. There was a door in our room the was locked and I can only assume it was a supply cupboard. The shower would flood when ever it was used. The room was very small and not at all luxurious. There was a long black hair on the side of the sink the whole time we where there. The carpet felt sticky and I couldn’t walk around in socks as was so disgusting.…
4012,"I was traveling with my mom for her birthday,upon checkin, no doorman available, nobody was helping me with my two big luggages even when I entered, the front desk didn't greet me at all until I started first. I don't what else to say to express how disapponited I was, I had a really high expectation for this hotel since it has such a long hospitality history, but the staff especially the Front desk agent at the executive floor."
4013,"This was the worst hotel experience I have ever had.  The owner was completely rude to us and has now attempted to over-charge me for a room that left a lot to be desired anyway!  His behavior is completely out of line and uncalled for.  He thought that he could take advantage of me because I am a woman, and I am not going to allow that to happen--I am disputing his charges through my credit card.  There are a lot of other hotels in the vacinity so please take me advice and STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!! "
4014,"Lovely quiet location, but not advisable for those with young children or mobility problems. The sunset each evening was spectacular. Villas are beautifully clean,have adequate equipment and pool areas are all well maintained and have glorious views. The upstairs bedrooms in Diamond and Emerald are accessed by a ladder, so totally unsuitable for older or very young guests. Also the indoor sitting area in Diamond was very small. Dimitris, the operation manger is extremely helpful,and on hand to offer advice, make bookings, order groceries etc Oia itself is very pretty, but avoid going in August when it is rammed with cruise ship guests, quad bikers and crazy car drivers. Santorini is a very hilly place with mostly unforgiving terrain.We only visited in August as we had a family…"
4015,We were really  looking forward to Rio but this hotel was a huge disappointment.    Carpets in the corridors looked worn and dirty.  Our room had marks on the walls.  The room itself was very small for a couple. A protruding  mirror on the base of the headboard prevented you being able to sit up comfortably in the small (very hard) double bed.  We had 2 suitcases as we were in South America for 2 weeks. We were unable to store these out of the way in the room. There was not enough storage  space to unpack and hang all our clothes.  The  bathroom was tiny - almost had to ‘shoehorn’ yourself into it.  The air conditioning was very ineffective due to where it was located.  The room  was therefore hot at night even with the air con on.  The adaptors in the wall are the new…
4016,"I stayed here for business on a convention, so had no choice in selecting hotels.  I wished I had a choice after the stay here at the Congress Plaza.  It was not good.... at ALL.  While the bedding and room appeared fairly clean, the hotel was in serious need of TLC.  I believe they renovated the rooms somewhat (if you like 70's tacky with lacquered furniture) but the hallways and lobby were old and decripit and really creepy to be honest.    I have a photo of the check-in line and it was like waiting for a ride in Disney World (not sure if they were short staffed or if they really didn't understand there was a convention in town).  The staff working check in weren't nice either (I like to at least give the benefit of the doubt when clerks are overwhelmed, but they didn't really…"
4017,"$379/night-before taxes-3 maintenance service calls to room over 4 night stay.. 2 for A/C not working-2 warm nights with A/C blowing warm air. One maintenance call because of standing water in shower. Bath towels old, thin and grayish in color. Employees offered decent sympathy but we're 100% ineffective in correcting my poor experience. As a 15 year Hilton Diamond guy, I expect more. Believe it or not, I never have complained before. Stay away from this hotel  Peter Underhill"
4019,"Stayed here for my first trip to Paris! And I am so happy I did. Service at reception/the front desk went out of their way to help in so many ways: mailing postcards, making reservations, holding luggage, giving me an adapter when mine failed. Just above and beyond for my needs. And truly everyone who worked here is just warm, kind, and helpful. Now location! I didn't know much about Parisian neighborhoods before arriving but I am glad I landed here. Close to two metros, great shopping around and only a couple stops away from historical sites, musees and restaurants. One of my favorite bars Bisou was right next door. And safe. I would stay here again, so accommodating. Thank you 1k!"
4020,My second stay at this hotel. Very modern and chic but in a rather run down wharf area which is connected by ferry to Central Station. This is your fastest and cheapest link to the city but make sure you have a timetable to avoid an expensive taxi ride ( ferry is free). Rooms are well equipped but very small. You may get one with no windows or facing a warehouse...Water views are the way to go. Check in was disappointing. No recognition of HH status no trademark cookie and every guest arriving was asked to wait until at least 3 pm to check in. Unusual in my experience..(hard to believe that everyone's room magically became available at the same latest possible time but that was the company line.. You are a minimum of 45 minutes from central station and there is little of appeal…
4021,"We had booked a big villa for 2 families of 5. While we were aware the villas were garden view, we certainly did not expect to be so far away from hotel, pool and beach - not walking distance - and within construction work area - starting at 7 am - as the hotel is currently going through an big refurbishment and expansion. Please see picture to check on villa view and path toward the hotel. While a buggy would come pick us quite reactively this was a bad surprise. On the plus side the villa is very spacious and modern with very descent size private swimming pool. In addition staff English proficiency was really bad which led to frustration in both sides. Basic requests such as a glass of water or black coffee would not be understood by most staff and we would have to help ourselves at the restaurant. For example while at the pool bar we order few cocktails that eventually were sent out to the villa while we were at the hotel swimming pool....Restaurant order management was also quite poor with kids burgers taking on average 45 to 50 mn.  So overall rather disappointing experience. We shared our experience with guest relation officer Mr Sean on our leaving day who understood our concerns. They offered 10pct discount on Food and Beverages which was nice but honestly did not make up for the overall feeling. The hotel may well be 4 star in few month time when everything is finished but not now. I would revcommend to avoid until construction is finished and staff get a massive training in english.…"
4022,"This hotel is not worthwhile to cover the price to pay. Choose other cheaper option. Location would be nice, but a little bit off from main attraction. Surprisingly, housekeeping tries to barge in at 8:20AM on check out date!"
4025,"We spent 3 nights at the Ibis Porto Centro  We found it was a very good location where we could walk to many of the important sights. Room is larger than some IBIS hotels, front desk staff were helpful.  On the less positive side, I found the towels very thin and the exterior of the windows badly need to be washed .  We did have beakfast there in one day. The cost 6.95 € includes cereal, bread, coffee, juice, yogurt, pastel,de nata.  It was nothing special but can be convenient if you don't have time to go elsewhere."
4026,The hotel and room were great but my main issue was the dishonest bartenders serving well liquor on cocktails listing top shelf alcohol. When I questioned them they admitted they did not have the top shelf liquor and used the lower priced booze instead. What a scam.
4028,Location and facilities are good but very disappointed about internet service when it disconnects frequently so it made me difficult in working.  Problem solving skills of management team is really bad. I would not stay here again anymore.
4029,"We arrived here 12th to 14th june for 2 nights stay during our road trip , hotel was easy to find , safe parking, hotel tucked away 10 mins from beach front of cannes,  very helpful staff , quaint hotel with lovely pool and loungers , no restaurant but lots of places to eat  nearby , room was nice  bed comfy ,   lots to see in cannes beautiful marina ,  nice beach ,  castle up on hill , wish we could  have stayed longer ."
4030,"Good rooms, nice staff. This hotel has a great pool and sauna and the fitness is nice as well. The bar is open until 1 and also offers food which is nice. The only downside that I noticed  is that a lot of strange people were staying here. The first night I saw a drunk women laying in front of the lift crying hysterically because her pizza was cold haha? The second day a man barely dressed walked down the lobby yelling at the staff. They also house wedding parties in the rooms near the lobby which produces a lot of noise and of course drunk people, so be aware."
4031,First off I am not one to complain.  However when a hotel advertises having a pool and you set your vacation with intent to ensure your children have a great time and there is no pool well... this hotel states as an amenity having a pool.  The pool is there but until you get to this hotel you will be told it is shut down and won't be open for a year.   I am unhappy about that but even more unhappy about the rude service at this hotel.  The personnel were more interested in texting than assisting and when I asked them if they could help they seemed upset that I interrupted their chat.  We got no help when asking for a manager and I would not recommend this hotel.  While we stayed at this hotel we experienced two other couples getting frustrated about no pool and other issues. …
4032,"Stayed one night at this incredible place. If you like gold, kitsch and a total lack of proportion this is your place to go.Best part is the friendly service, but this is outweighed completely by the decoration both inside and outside. As for that it is probably the worst I have seen. Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur copied in gold.. fake gold and marble all over the place. Rooms with absolutely no taste other than generally bad. The faucets are even for seasoned travelers an enigma as you can chose between ""cold"" and ""kalt"" water.. just look at the photo."
4033,"We checked in on July 31 and checked out on August 4. This hotel was central to everything we planned and did and our view of the cathedral and the surrounding plaza - an upgrade - was breathtaking. The hotel is in an old building which is spectacularly maintained. The staff was very attentive and efficient. However, on close inspection upon check in, the bathroom was not cleaned to perfection as we found some unappetizing body hair on the floor and in the bathtub (which was gone the next day). Also the TV was on the fritz on our first day but the maintenance staff addressed this issue quickly after we reported it to the front desk. The breakfast- also an upgrade- was excellent and the wait staff was very attentive. I would stay here again, but hope the housekeeping staff will…"
4034,"Not my first time at the Clift...but certainly my last.  Visiting during the Dreamforce tradeshow.  Room was over $700 per night...during non-Dreamforce, I have stayed here for $325 per night.  Absolute highway robbery.  I get supply and demand, but totally unacceptable.  The room was roomy and comfortable but the bathroom was over the top dirty...shower ties were mildewy, walls were dirty...really yucky.  Never again  "
4035,"I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights. My first impression was that the outside is revolting but the inside quite nice. Upon arrival I went for a walk down the street and realised I was located in the worst possible area I could be in San Francisco.. Surrounded by gangs, homeless, prostitutes and drug addicts I felt very unsafe and quickly made my way back to the hotel. My first night here was disgraceful. Situated on level two I could hear every conversation every footstep and every momvement made above me, this alongside the man and woman who had a verbal screaming match an were throwing things and running up and down, kept me awake all night. There was nothing done about the distressing fight by staff. Fortunately the hotel did move me to the highest level so I could not hear…"
4036,"It is actually not easy to pick a right hotel while you have seen too many beautiful hotel photos online and they all look nice, classy or chic within the similar price range.  Hope my review can help you to narrow down your selections.  In 2015, I stayed at Sofitel Le Faubourg and their rooms price raised a lot this July.  Since 8th arr. is where I familiar with so I decided to stay at Hotel Chavanel.   I booked a deluxe room for 4 nights from July 8th.  I really like this hotel for their excellent location, winthin 5 min to Franprix and within 10 min to Printemps, Lafayette and Monoprix.  The stuff was very friendly and helpful.  I felt sorry for travellers who experieced bad services. The buffet breakfast area was not big, they offered simple and yummy pastries, boiled eggs,…"
4038,The bright and shiny exterior is just that... a facade. The material on the bed was ripped. The additional fees were more than the room itself. It took forever to get anything from housekeeping. I would’ve saved money by staying at the St Regis. 
4039,"Location is not central, the hotel is about 20 mns from the old town but in a quiet residential area filled with other luxury venues. But it is not inconvenient at all, as it's a quiet and posh residential hood.  This hotel is in appearance of higher standards than the regular crowne plazza and has 5 stars features. The general impression on arrival was very good.  Room 1406 was very comfortable and large, i was upgraded to a small ""suite"" room roughly 30sqm (but open space) with with a living-room area, just 3 meters from the the very comfortable king size bed dotted with plush cushions and high quality beddings. A bottle of Port wine with some sweets were waiting for me as a gesture, and the bathroom was large with a tub, and a toilet facing a bidet.  However the bathroom…"
4040,"We would advise the management of the hotel to step up the cleanliness of the rooms.  Under the bed were layers of dust and hair.  I had to find something that was fallen, I felt with my hand to find it 🤢  Also our car was ridden like a maniac by the vallet guy. "
4041,"Well, this is a new low for price gouging.  I had a quick business trip to SF and, watching the corporate budget, chose this hotel at a rate of $313/night.  To be sure, this is a LOW END Courtyard - room was probably 90 sq feet, no view of anything, fecal and urinary odors 1 step out the front door.  But $313 is low for SF, and i trusted the CY brand. So you can imagine my shock when i received my e-bill with the second and third nights at $999/night.  No, thats not a typo, as i thought.  When i called, they said the rate aiutomatically goes up when the hotel is full.  REALLY?   $1000 per night?  Why not $10,000?  $100,000?  i called Marriott Corporate about it.  AQs a Platinum Elite member with hundreds of Marriott stays and a CLV undoubtedly right up there, i was sure we would…"
4043,"Nice and clean rooms. U-bahn near so you get quickly everywhere. Nice and helpful personal. Only breakfast was very expensive, so we ate it nearby at cafes. There are several cafes around. Also some restaurants."
4044,We stayed in room number 13 which is an apartment. Lovely large bedroom. Nice bathroom and large family room with good beds for the kids. The family room also includes a full kitchen. The only drawback is their WiFi did not work in our room and never got to it. Worked fine in the lobby. The breakfast is nothing to write home about.
4045,"The hotel is conveniently located closed to Ericsson business quarters and not too far away from the subway and Kista Gallery. It features nice interior design of the common areas and exceptional breakfast. I have only one comment about it: the rooms are rather basic, and very cold! The temperature adjustment did almost nothing to the general atmosphere and i was only saved by an electric heater missing one front wheel :) "
4046,"The hostel itself was brilliant. Great facilities, a bar genuinely open 24 hours a day, chilled atmosphere and beautiful surroundings. What made my stay however was no doubt the impeccable staff we were greeted by. Sven, the reception manager, has to be up there with one of the nicest guys I have ever met. Always stopping to say hi, always smiling and offering a wealth of knowledge they allowed us to discover the real Berlin. I must also mention the wonderful lady behind the bar Lena. She was amazing. Once again always smiling and always happy to help. Thanks guys, you really made our trip special. See you in 3 weeks!"
4048,"Vista Restaurant belongs to a luxurious Vietnamese Mui Ne resort called the Cliff. We didn't stay at the hotel but wanted to test the upscale restaurant during our vacation in Mui Ne area.  The setting is wonderful. A stylish restaurant with an amazing ocean view, tasteful Christmas decorations, beautiful flowers and a versatile menu for all tastes.  Unfortunately, it ends there. The food was ok, the service less than ok.  We came to the restaurant quite early for a Boxing Day dinner and were received by a relatively unengaged person who meant that we could sit anywhere we wanted.  We found a very nice table and were greeted by a polite young man who took our orders and disappeared.  A couple of minutes later two waitresses approached us with the menus. We told that we had…"
4049,I stayed because I was in the Berlin Marathon. Needed a close location to the start line and needed to contain costs. All needs met. Place was clean and location of the hotel was perfect. Man at front desk very pleasant. The small breakfast option also was just enough. Internet was not the best but not the worst. Plenty of shopping and places to eat with maybe a 6 minute walk.  I enjoyed my stay!!
4050,"This was one of the worst Marriott's I have ever stayed in. The staff was great as always. The room had holes in the walls, carpet that had been worn down so much there was no carpet left. They wanted 1028.00 a night when the JW or Marriott a block away was 556 a night. Category 7 no way no matter where they are located."
4051,"Generally for a night stop you'd be looking for a good price vs good location for the stay. Apollon hotel meets both with around 107$ per night, the area is quiet with no street noise plus it's 1 minute walk to the nearest metro station on line 13. I took a single room with a very comfortable bed, nice colors and good view from the 4th floor, the only draw back was that there was little room to open my large luggage in the room but it was expected. In the same street there's a nice cafe where i had dinner and coffee the next morning. Also the hotel is walking distance from the main lively areas of Montparnasse and a few minutes from Gare Montparnasse "
4055,"Stayed just one night.  Only chose this hotel as it had parking available. The hotel reception resembles more of a mini cab booking office with breakfast cereals in dirty plastic containers, which look like they have been stored here for years.The room was on the first floor with a walkway going all the way around. The room was filthy with cobwebs. The paintwork felt tacky with dirt. The bed appeared clean. The shower did not work at all so we were unable to shower before leaving for our flight. If I had seen the room prior to our arrival I would have cancelled and stayed  somewhere  else."
4056,"Six nights went ok. Nice to have air conditioning in the room, it was quite hot, 30  C outside. No minibar and quite a walk, 700m to nightlife/bars in Prenzlberg, if you must have cons. Though it's the same distance to Alex, but that's a bit unpersonal choice. So you must kind of know what to do when staying here, but if you do, a good choice and a very friendly personnel there. And super beds!"
4057,"This is just a review of the restaurant of Bo Resort, as we were staying in a nearby hotel and were advised by a friend to go there for lunch. The food is mediocre at best. My husband's pizza was fine, my vegetable spring rolls eatable and the kids' fish nuggets disgusting. However, the problem was that during our lunch, a dog (confirmed later by some guests as being the hotel's dog) was glued to our table. The staff didn't say or do anything. When we were about to leave, my 4-yr old son tried to touch the dog (still glued to our table) to cuddle it. I barely had the time to tell him ""Don't"", and my son barely had the time to touch this dog with a finger, that the dog turned and bit my son's hand.  Reaction from the 3 staff: none, just a purely disinterested look. After one…"
4058,"Highly recommend Hotel Original Paris to anyone visiting Paris! This was our first Paris trip with our 25 y/o son. We booked a triple room and were upgraded to a quadruple room on check-in. The room would comfortably fit four people.  The hotel’s décor/style was so unique and fun. The toilet was in a separate room, enabling use the shower/sinks (double sink). More than enough storage with two closets was provided. Electrical outlets were in abundance. The beds/pillows were extremely comfortable and bathroom amenities were excellent (shampoos, etc.). Our room faced the courtyard, making sleeping very quiet, being that the hotel was on a busy street. Breakfast was offered at 15 euros, which we passed on being that we were more interested in the area’s bistros and cafes. Coffee is provided throughout the day and a “honesty bar” (pay at checkout) for those interested in wine/alcohol in their breakfast/lounge area.  The location is all one could ask for between Bastille and Marais. Bastille metro is one block away with lines 1 & 8, traveling to all main Paris sights, as well as buses. If you’re a walker, you can get to most sights. Restaurants/bars are in abundance outside the front door and the hotel staff offers great recommendations. The area becomes quite lively in the evening with a real local flair. However, staff is what makes this boutique hotel a standout. From check-in to check-out, they were friendly, professional and welcoming.…"
4059,"General: For a short trip to Berlin we opted for this hotel. The hotel lives up to its promise. The staff is friendly and helpful, you always feel well looked after and supported. The receptionist is always approachable, the kitchen is also open 24/7.   Location: The hotel is centrally located and you can reach both the subway and tram, etc. The environment is pleasant, clean and attractive.   Facilities: The hotel is modern and equipped with everything you need. The rooms are big enough, clean and functional. There was not enough space for the clothes, but that was not too bad. The bathroom is also clean, modern, bright and attractively designed - you feel immediately at ease. We recommend a room, which is directed to the courtyard, we liked it very much. There is also an…"
4060,"I'm sorry say, but our recent stay was really disappointing. We stayed at this hotel 8 years ago and had a great time This time however the hotel was tired and somewhat dirty Paint work was scraped, window Jon room was filthy dirty and even the bed linen was frayed and ripped?!  The staff were aloof and generally unhelpful. Breakfast was a joke - completely overpriced and under delivered. "
4063,"Positive aspects: new hotel, nice rooms, very good breakfast (excellent bread) and helpful front-desk staff.  Negative aspects: room cleaned superficially or not at all, long queues at the elevator several times a day, queuing for breakfast!!!  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this hotel to my friends."
4064,"How to start... this hotel has it all. Great building, great rooms, great foods and cocktails, but most of all amazing people. It feels like visiting friends and they are always so welcoming. Been here more than 10times and I will keep on coming here. "
4065,"First impressions of this hotel were very poor as we were greeted by the most miserable, grumpy man on reception. We then went to our executive superior ocean front room and not only was it not very clean but we found ants on the bed side table, on the bed and on the floor – how housekeeping missed this I do not know. I rang reception and they said they would send housekeeping to check – they also found ants and then they sent a bell boy to collect our luggage and move us to another room two floor up. This room was much cleaner than the previous one and had no ants – hurray! The view from the room onto Copacabana beach is across 4 lanes of traffic and then the beach and sea – do not expect to walk from the hotel onto the beach as none of the hotels are on the beach front.   We promptly went up to the roof top pool to be completely underwhelmed by a tiny pool and at the most 10-15 sun loungers . It is not a relaxing area as it is so squashed with everyone vying for a sun lounger and the tiny space in the pool. However, it does have a lovely view onto Copacabana beach and the sea.  We ate at the restaurant on the same floor as the pool and it is very plain, nothing special. We had a pizza (lots of cheese) and a steak sandwich – the steak was disgusting.   Breakfast was in the restaurant downstairs and much nicer than the one upstairs, it had a good selection of fruits, cakes, pastries, hot and cold food but unfortunately, I had an upset stomach after eating the food.  On the next day, housekeeping did not clean our room; I had to ring down to reception to ask them to clean it and the receptionist then suggested that perhaps this was our fault??!! Approximately 45 minute later housekeeping arrived to clean the room.  On the last day we asked to have the room one hour longer as I was still ill after eating the food from the hotel but it was declined.  Overall, a very disappointing hotel and one I do not recommend. We were part of a group tour and not one person was happy with this hotel, we all wished we had paid to upgrade to the Belmond hotel instead.…"
4066,"I really love the design of the room. White and blue, very clean. The bed was very comfy and the room was spacey. The bathroom was also very lovely.  However, the staff weren't exactly on point. I arrived around 10am. There was no bell boy.... I carried my luggage up the stairs myself. I arrived too early for my room, they told me they would inform me as soon as the room become available (I decided to wait around the lobby for my friends as they haven't arrived yet). My friends got in around 12pm. They checked in and were told their room was ready so I was going to go leave my stuff in their room first. That was when the staff told us my room was also ready. I was amazed at how my room could become available as soon as my friends checked in! (my suspicion told me that the room…"
4067,"I lost my luggage in the metro right after I checking out the hostel. I had no choice at that time so that I went back to the hostel. They provided all help so that I felt very secured right away. (Information like ticket refund, police office location ,where to shop..) in the end, I finished my trip happily."
4068,We never intended on eating here; we hadn’t booked at the staff were lovely and accommodating. Not a huge menu but everything was done to perfecting. I highly recommend the schnitzel and the veal cheeks 
4069,Poor check in process - staff took forever to process payment and forgot to return my passport. No soundproofing in rooms. If they allocate you a room with X02 do NOT take it as it is beside the lift. You won't be able to sleep at all. Bathroom has poor drainage and limited hot water. It will smell musty the next day.   Fyi breakfast is on the first floor. You have to ask or they won't tell you. 
4070,"I've stayed in a few Ritz-Carlton hotels all over the world - this one definitely does not meet the standard - more like a low end Sheraton. Location is exceptional. We stayed to celebrate a major wedding anniversary. As a Platinum Exec member I did get an upgrade, but the whole experience left me underwhelmed - more like my usual week day stay in a city Sheraton. Food and drinks ordered outside were not great - oysters were mediocre and cocktail had to be sent back (I don't think I've ever sent back a cocktail). We planned to eat in their restaurant, but changed plans and ate at the golf club (which was great) because we were concerned we'd get more of the same bad service/experience. It also seems like gouging to charge overnight guests $47 for valet parking - its not like a…"
4071,"Given its star rating, I was expecting a great deal more.  But then again, I had just been spoiled badly by the Belmond hotels in Rio and Foz.  Public spaces were good although I thought the design was heavy and overdone modernist.  Room facilities, including the undersized bed that was supposed to be a king, were overall disappointing.  Clean enough I suppose but far from spotless.  Would not recommend.  Look for something more interesting."
4072,"Overall the hotel is a good place, with friendly staff and good food  - unfortunately but sleep affected by noise from nearby construction sites  I will be a perfect spot once renovation/ construction close by is over"
4073,"not 'posh elegant' but nicely renovated, loads of maritime themed antiques and bricabrac; ...quite stylish design  super location;  good wifi, seems to be good views from all sides, competent even if not especially engaged staff  no real negatives, would stay again for sure"
4074,"My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton Barra for a week in March.  The location is GREAT - amazing beach, especially if you're a runner or a surfer.  About a 25 minute bus ride to Leblon/Ipanema.  The hotel lobby is great too, but the rooms stink - literally!  We tried two rooms.  Both were really musty, and the sofa and sheets just smelled like they had been wet too many times.  It was pretty intolerable."
4075,A beautiful classic hotel right on the water. Needs a little updating. Rooms are very large. Comfortable beds. Unique layout in the bathroom. Great breakfast buffet. Concierge staff are very helpful with good advice. 
4076,The pillows' comfort and quality have deteriorated since the hotel acquisition and the room did not come with the welcome fruits as communicated on the Le Club Accor loyalty programme for attaining the gold membership.
4077,"The hotel is in a good location on the beach, the breakfast is good and when you can corner a member of staff they are helpful and friendly. Sadly that's where the good news ends.  The rooms smell damp, the service was often slow and bizarrely for a hotel that claims to welcome international travelers; there was no internet.   The real shame is that with just a little attention to detail and a few changes, this could be a great hotel. I'll probably stay away until that happens though!"
4078,"this hotel is brilliant. Easy check in, lovely spacious room overlooking the River Spree and excellent breakfast. Right in the centre of the Mercedes Arena area with shops and bars and of course fantastic artwork We stayed for 2 nights and had 3 full days there. I bought a daily Tagescart for daily travel which cost Euros 7.70 and this takes in all the zones (ABC) C zone is the airport and generally speaking you wont need that. Most of the exciting things are in zone AB-the ticket costs 7 Euros. The ticket lasts unit 3am so great value. The station is about a 7 minute walk to the hotel there is a fitness centre as well. The staff were so helpful they even stored our luggage as we had a late flight. Checkout is midday and there is access to computors in the reception area all…"
4079,"I stayed at this hotel as part of a British Airways package deal to Berlin, and couldn't have been more impressed. The hotel is very well presented, with a quirky, modern aesthetic that really works. All the staff I interacted with were fantastic, all friendly, polite and extremely efficient.   The rooms are very well kept, spacious and clean. They feature air conditioning, large flat screen TVs with Google Chromecast for streaming content from your mobile and good fast free wifi.  Breakfast had to be the highlight of the stay though! Ranging from traditional bacon and scrambled eggs to a wide range of local meats, cheeses, pastries, cakes, everyone's tastes were catered for. Everything was well presented and tasted fantastic.  It is worth noting that this hotel is located a few…"
4080,"I have booked the hotel for the locatio, the way it looked online and the reviews online. For example, on booking.com the hotel gets a 8.9 rating. Although the accomodation was fine and the location is indeed great, it is not more than a good hotel. So a 7 rating is more than enough. Staff is great, very friendly, but rooms are small (especially for the price), small bathroom and it is pretty noisy. We had room 211, which has a balcony in an alley, with all cooling machines and other machines next to it. This caused a lot of noise - day and night - like there is a truck below you window. So, although we had a great time (Lisbon itself is great!), I wouldn't stay in the same hotel the next time, just because of these noise issues and the fact that it has some small issues."
4081,"The last weekend was the most disappointing experience I have ever had in the past 10 years of my traveling for business.  When I arrived on Friday evening the front desk person by the name of Jason didn't want to honor my reservation. The reason was that he wanted a proof that I work for my company. Since it was about 9pm and weekend, I wasn't able to provide that on the spot and he even several times asked me to cancel the reservation for me. I'm not sure why he insisted me to do so or if he wanted to give my room to someone else, but I didn't do it.   I had waited for about 2 hours and I had to take out my computer equipment, log into my company systems and get some kind of verification for Jason. About two hours later, around 11 pm, I was able to provide him with the proof.…"
4082,"Me and my fiancée stayed here for 3 nights and we were happy with the hotel. The room was spacious and clean. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was great. The room also had its own safe. Location was perfect. A five minute walk to a main metro station which was simple enough to use and a €12 taxi drive from the main train station in Berlin. The staff were helpful and kind. The only problems we had were that there was no kettle with tea, coffee etc. and that the wi-fi was pretty poor. Definitely would stay here again though. "
4083,Thank goodness we only needed this for one night - the worst room ever.  Firstly it’s situated near the cleaners storage cupboard so really noisy early.  Secondly it’s very small for a delux king with absolutely no view and only small window. Not what we expected or hoped and will not be returning- stayed here 3 times now and it’s really hit and miss each time.  That was our last time.  We even asked when we checked in if it was a quiet room - soo disappointing. We are Hilton honors members but seriously considering going to SPG !!  We were charged $275 for the worst night- never again!!
4084,"Hotel is very very good at really top location. Dinner was in top 5 we ever had. Maybe one downside that the hotel needs little bit of polish but still this is an amazing hotel that I would select again if traveling to Berlin. We stayed in Junior suite which I think is perfect and I would suggest to go with it. For me what sells the hotel is its location and very nice dinner experience that we had...if you are in Berlin, you cant go wrong here...great place to stay"
4086,"Had a problem with scheduling.  I've stayed there before and try to stay there when I'm on business.  They wouldn't let me modify my reservation, took my money and never called me back or returned my email. Terrible on their part."
4087,"Room was dirty,bedding was stained ,carpet was stained, bathroom was ropey to say the least and the main door to the room didn’t close properly. My nephew had some locals trying to wake him at 2am to get in his room. Little or no security. Would not stay here ever again. Don’t be fooled by the breakfast, it’s rubbish."
4088,"Very well located, 50 m of the nearest UBahn station, 200 m of the terminal bus stop for the Tegel Airport and all around very good restaurants or bakeries.  The hotel's staff is very friendly and do its best to make sure your trip is going well.  The bedroom is very comfortable, enough big and with a clever design bathroom (shower and toilets).  The air conditioning system is not the best we had for the noise it produces and do not deliver a fresh air. We had Very warm nights.  If we come back to Berlin we'll try to book this hotel again "
4090,"Disappointing trip. The halls of the hotel stunk, the room was tiny compared to the pics online and the bathroom sink was in the sleeping area. Had to leave a night early!   Would never book this hotel again and makes me never want to prepay for a hotel I don't know ever again!"
4091,"I stayed here for 4 nights for a conference in the nearby Crowne Plaza. As a Gold member I expected to get an upgrade but not at this property. No reason was given (the hotel was certainly not full). I did not get information on the facilities of the hotel (gym,,...). The rooms are a good size, you get a decent desk and internet speed is very good. The restaurant was disappointing: 3-course lunch menu with only 1 option (2 options for main course) so no à la carte at all.  Food tasted a bit bland. Breakfast was uninspired. I also had a meal at the Crowne Plaza next door which was much better (sorry Sheraton: must do better). The hotel is far from the city centre and there is no real view from the rooms (just buildings). "
4092,"I found the reception staff extremely rude, they never seemed to be at the desk so i was left waiting until someone arrived to assist me. When we first arrived the rude receptionist brushed us off. Also I found the car park was inconvenient to access."
4093,"My family enjoyed our stay.  Really loved the welcoming goodies.  They were a nice touch and very useful (milk, orange juice, toast crackers, jelly, water, coffee, wine, chocolate).  By the way, the wine was excellent.  The rooms were good size and the beds were comfy.  Even had an electrically converter in a drawer that I used which was convenient.  I was able to use the one I brought and the extra one so we could charge both cell phones.  Value for what we got was excellent.  Apartment is on the 4th floor but there is an elevator which was not advertised so don't overlook this place.  Great location.  "
4094,Staff are rude and unhelpful.  Noisy felt like we were in a hostel. Restaurant closed. Vending machines don’t work but staff don’t care. Charged for things we didn’t have  rooms very shabby. Just awful place 
4095,"We stayed at this property a few times but felt service deteriorated lately. Room cleaning is superficial and smells strange, front desk staff is stiff, furnishing looks Old and breakfast is the same as two years ago! We must give the place a low score."
4097,"Although we were given a suite that gave us extra space in a lounge area, we didn’t really need it for a 2 night stay.  Our room was dark and dingy, lacked adequate lighting and power points, which are essential for the modern tourist with cameras and other devices that require charging.  The air conditioning was noisy and difficult to set.  Our windows were open on arrival, and found them stiff and difficult to close to block the noise of the traffic.  Staff were “helpfully” manning the  lifts, possibly with the best of intentions to enable a long queue of tourists to proceed quickly to the upper floors, but allowed locals to push in, until I intervened."
4098,"When you enter the hotel the looks are nice, lobby also and the bar also looks nice with a wide variety on drinks. Free diner buffer was not very big, but of good quality.  However, for me the most important is/are the room(s) and i didn't like it. Wooden floors (very noisy), very basic cabinet, no mini-bar/fridge, old bathroom with some broken things... I did like the bed which was nice and soft. Wouldn't choose for this hotel when travelling for business anymore."
4100,"I made a reservation through venere.com. When I got to the hotel they said that my room was already booked and they are sorry, but they cannot accept my reservation. They referred me to another hotel named Park Hotel.   I never experienced such a thing in my life. I talked to the hotel manager and all she had to say is that there is nothing she can do. She was ¨nice¨ enough to say that she is sorry.   I had no other choice, but to go to another hotel. I highly suggest you just skip this hotel. There are so many hotels in San Francisco. Why should you go through such a terrible experience."
4101,"Sheraton is a typically furnished Marriott Hotel.   It is comfortable and the rooms are quite comfortable.   However,  for a 5 star hotel, we expected our visit to be fault free or at least close to fault free,   Firstly room was Hot -  there is an individual climate control in each room - but this is little short of useless.   We phoned down to reception who said they would get a technician to look at it.   We expected a knock on the door but instead got a phone call  from reception to say that the technician had looked at the temperature of our room,  decided that it was in fact too hot and he had centrally changed a setting to allow us to get colder air.   This was just about passable but does make a joke of the individual climate control you get in each room.   We also had…"
4102,"We stay at the Taj & Shangri-la hotels across India & Asia and have come to expect warm, professional service from staff, combined with a clean, high-end product. Unfortunately, after an awkward & lengthy check-in, I was brought to my room which was musty, had outdated furniture & a noisy air-conditioner....  Frankly, this hotel is out of character for the Shangri-la & Taj.  In a land that prides itself on exceptional service & some of the best hotels around, the Shangri-La Eros is a disappointment. Several alternatives in Delhi with much better quality for a similar price. "
4103,I stayed here with my brother for two nights and we had a very pleasant stay. If you’re happy to travel for 20/30 minutes to centre it’s a great place to stay. Comfortable and clean and front reception desk was very amiable!
4104,"Despite the nice central location, the Rendezvous is poorly maintained and offers sub par service. The toilet didn't flush when we arrived in our room. The front desk never seemed to have any idea what was going on. And while the Rendezvous demands four-star hotel prices for their restaurant, the quality of food is anything but. You can do better in Shanghai for half the price."
4106,"I stayed in Maksoud Plaza for a week in November 2013 in Executive Double Room on the 11th floor. It was my third time in Sao Paulo, but first at Maksoud. I was positively impressed with the design of the building and elevators that overlook the inner yard of the hotel.  I had a few more surprises, but they were less nice.   Apart from people at the reception, English is not in use, as it seems. The waiter at the restaurant did not know English well enough to explain what juices they had, and in the other hotel's cafe just outside the building there was no menu in English and the waiter could not speak English at all. The waiter phoned the hotel and asked for another person to come and translate the menu, but after waiting for 5 minutes for that person I gave up and returned to…"
4107,Very nice location in the centre of the city with good parking facilities. Rooms are spacious and well equiped. They could use a minor detailed update. Breakfast is good. Nice to have a restaurant but the menu is somehow limited. So not to really to dine there several times.  
4108,"The location could be good, but consider a hotel right across the Congress in Buenos Aires..there were manifests every single day, twice or three times a day... the traffic became chaotic, although pacific, it disturbs any trip...specially when they wake you up at 5:30-6 AM in your vacation. The room itself wasn't that bad, besides the king bed, which mattress was definitely old and crooked. Honestly, not a good choice. After 3 nights I changed to another one...the location was not that central, but the price x comfort worth it!"
4109,"My husband and I had recently stayed at the Nikko Hotel. Every year we plan a vacation on our anniversary in April. My husband works in Law Enforcement and we save up yearly for that ""one vacation"" together.   We flew in from Boston on April 15th, arrived at the Nikko, only to discover our room was not ready for us. No big deal, we understand this thing happens. The front desk girl offered to hold our bags in their ""locked/secure"" area (the bell-hop area), and suggested we grab some lunch. We received a text from the hotel after we had just finished our lunch stating that our room was now ready.  We returned from lunch and handed the girl at the front desk our baggage claim tags. She informed us that she would have the bell-hop bring our luggage right up to our room. As promised…"
4110,"Localization: good, close to Ponte Garajau (Christo Rei), good communication with Funchal Rooms: be careful to get a former ""twin"" room (two hotel rooms, connected with the locked door). You may hear every single sound from the adjacent room - no privacy at all. Fortunately, the staff has found us a new room after our request. It's clearly visible, that the hotel hasn't been renovated from a long time. Food: rather low-moderate. Dinners: meat very fatty, not so good. Fish ok. Other things rather ok, but not many things to choose. Breakfast: always the same, not so many vegetables. We've got an indigestion after one of the dinners...."
4111,This is a nice looking hotel. Check-in was smoith though not anything memorable.  The property is supposed to be non smoking but I could smell smoke here and there through the night. I did not bring it up to the staff because really there isn't much they could do.  The layout of the room was odd. It's s long room with the desk in the middle and the tv is at the far end. Bathroom was nice with a great selection of toiletries.  The hotel is not near the tourist attractions and you'll need to take a taxi. 
4112,"excellent location, very friendly team, modern, clean hotel and the bed super comfortable..Near the hotel is the east side gallery, the train station, the zalando outlet.Especially for the music choices, it was a great day to start a nice breakfast and great music.  I warmly recommend it"
4113,"Was put up here by American Airlines after my flight was cancelled. There is not enough space to describe how bad this place is. I will sum it up by saying it Smells, is Dirty, the food is Awful. The sheets are so bad that they light up the room at night with static electricity ! There are no curtains that close and this is after I asked to change rooms to a better one.  I would never stay in this place again, next time if there is no choice of Hotel left I will sleep on the floor at O'Hare."
4115,"Lobby was nice and smelled good then off to our room we had dried fesses on bathroom floor, wood mat where bed is we tripped over them they had to come steam it, no ice bucket had to wait 30 minutes to get it management didn’t really compensate the way a Hotel should and health department should inspect due to another guest with unsanitary conditions. Paying about $300 a night this visit my family will never again stay here."
4116,So this is a really nice hotel to stay with small clean lite room with nice interior design. I enjoy also our breakfast in this old tipe renovated venue with the big windows.   And always was someone in the reception if you need something. 
4117,"We stayed at the Mercure for two nights to celebrate our 12 year anniversary. The hotel reception area is really colourful, bright and beautiful! All the staff are really friendly and helpful. There was a miscommunication with our room request. The girl who I tried to correct the error with was very apologetic and did everything she could to help.  Our room was really nice and cleaned perfectly every day. The breakfast was tasty and plentiful! They even have an automated pancake machine! The location is perfect! Right next to the main shopping street and Ka De We, 20 second walk to the train station. Lovely hotel, lovely staff. "
4118,"The bed was amazing, the shower was good our room did not have a bathtub, the facility did not have a little shop to get basic items (which would have been really nice to have) and was next door to a concert venue.  The bar's beer selection included only local craft beer which we found to be too floral so they may want to consider adding some brands that cater to their travel clients.  It was within a 10 minute walk to the train and bus station and some shops.  The room was a small, basic hotel room with a desk, bed, one chair at the desk and a seating area near the window.  When they did have a concert it was loud at night (work night) and they began cleaning it with what sounded like leaf blowers at midnight when we had to be up early to catch a flight.    We felt very safe in…"
4119,"Rooms and beds are OK. But avoid rooms looking to the street, otherwise you'll be not able to open windows till 1am, due to street noise. Wood parquet floors are very bad. (We lived in 2 rooms) TV has only Hispanic channels. Internet is slow. Tea and coffee is provided outside the rooms. Bath room and shower in it are very inconvenient. AC working OK. Takes 20-30 min on taxi to get to interesting objects in BA. Breakfast is OK. Staff is helpful and speak English. Very good restaurant across the street. 3-stars, Choose if it is not expensive."
4120,"We booked the Mandala Suites for it’s location and price. The street has a lot of brand name shops in it and has both U and S stations close. It is also close to Checkpoint Charlie and all 4 Hop-on-hop-off bus routes have stops near by. It is also a 10 minute walk to Brandenburg Gates.  The suite we had was a good size and handy to have a separate bedroom from living room and kitchen. The breakfast room was located on the 8th floor and so was the gym and sauna rooms with good views. The only downside from the room was the water temperature for the shower kept going up and down. Something minor to watch out for.  The major disappointment for us was that the hotel photos seemed to show the great views, but we found out that these are only available from levels 6 and above, so,…"
4121,"My friend and I were trying to book a two-bed private room for three individuals to stay in over 4-nights. We called in over the phone to get a quote. Not only were we given three different quotes by two different staff (one of whom was a woman called Mary and the other a male) -- and the quotes kept frustratingly getting higher each time we called back -- but both staff members were disrespectful, rude, kept putting us on hold, and kept interrupting both my friend and myself while we were merely trying to clarify the quote. Not only was this treatment unprofessional and disrespectful, it tarnishes the reputation we will ever have of the Chicago Getaway Hostel. We will never try to reserve a room with you again. I would suggest you give your staff sensitivity and customer…"
4122,"Plus: Decent location, quaint hotel that is older, wine mixer each evening. Minus: Walls are paper thin. Staff are apathetic. Each morning the people in the adjoining room wake up at 5:00am and in turn wake us up. The walls are ridiculously thin and make for a sound sleep. Front desk couldn't be bothered. It is expensive, but so is San Fran. "
4123,"So sadly disappointed! We were scammed into a raffle to win a free vacation. Our name was pulled, I am guessing everyone that filled out a form won, and we were told we won 4 airline tickets for 2 separate Windham all inclusive trips. Our only obligation was a 1 hour presentation in Chicago. Upon arrival, we were told the presentation was 2 hours and we needed to wait in a crowded hallway for who knows how long. Well, that did not happen, we left. There were high pressure sales going on all around us.   This will never happen again, travelers be ware!"
4124,"Disappointed. Great staff, great restaurant and location. Spa and room need updating. Room has dark black bathroom including Black toilet paper. Santorini is such a beautiful island a bright room would be nice. Spa treatment 200 euros and nothing was offered  other than than a cold cup of tea. No heat room  no zen feeling etc The hotel pool is beautiful    View is awesome  but that is available at many hotels in Santorini.  Shuttle service to active part Oia only in the evening not for day time  "
4126,"Nice hotel with all the things you need. Comfortable clean rooms, breakfast with all you could ask for. Short walking distance the center off city. Good facilities at the hotel - cosy bar and recommendable restaurant. In all a very good experience."
4127,"Location was fabulous, can’t fault it.  Hotel is very clean and tidy but really lacks atmosphere.  Some of the bar staff friendly others very unfriendly. Room was nice enough although quite small.  The bathroom was tiny and we were so disappointed that it didn’t have a bath.  Bedroom cleaning could have been better. When the room was cleaned a dirty cup was left by the bed."
4128,"Pretty hotel with a great pool area and city views, but rooms leave a lot to be desired in terms of space, functionality, amenities. I’m used to the Melia properties in Caribbean. This is not that.   On Saturday there is a sexy pool party that is free entrance to hotel guests. House music and drinks and shisha flowing. See and be seen. If in your 20s early 30s you likely will love this. Late 30s/ 40s, maybe. Prices are kind of outrageous. Comparable or more to if in a club. Drinks were the most pricey anywhere we went during our week trip. Shisha was 100 euro. Minimum spend of 280 euros for their daybeds even if guest. "
4129,"We stayed for a couple of nights in this hotel.  The room was really small and narrow, and I kind of had the feeling the water was very smelly. When we arrives at the hotel we were greeted but I had the expression we weren't really welcomed, and we had to ask a lot of questions to get all the informations we need for the next day. And I was really dissappointed, when we left the hotel, they didn't even say goodby, just looked at us! Not very professional in my eyes! The food was good and the view from the Restaurant great. But the are area around the hotel wasn't lovely at all. There are a lot of constructions on the street and it was really dirty and noisy on the streets. But I have to say, I came to Lisbon to explore the city and get to know the culture, and for this reason…"
4130,"This is the worst hotel ever I have ever stayed in SFO. The front desk service was weak, the systems are down. They sent us to a room that was already occupied, we actually woke up a couple who was asleep. They then gave us another room. The carpet looks dirty dusty and unwashed for a Long time, the room has a musky smell. The aircon did not work. The guy sent up to help us was super arrogant. He told us if we were not happy, we could always leave! The aircon finally worked but it was noisy as hell. We paid close to 350 per night for this that feels like a motel with Low grade service style. There is no manager on site to even speak to, no wonder such Low service level and pride in their staff. The hotel did not inform us they were under renovation when we book - outright…"
4131,"This hotel definitely need to update the rooms interiors for the price that I paid. Due to the nature of the old building and surrounding this town, I do not mind to stay in this old building but the minimum interior quality need to be reasonable! I got turnoff by the old furnitures and old bed mattresses which can not even support my back with my average weight 158 lbs. In my opinion this hotel is over priced with the current quality."
4132,Me and my husband stayed there for a weekend. The service was great. Very friendly and helpful staff. The room was very clean. The bathroom was great! We ate there breakfast that was also wonderful. The location is great- walking distance to everything
4134,"I have been coming to for many years to Cannes for the MIPIM convention, and stayed at Villa Claudia  that has just changed owner and has been renovated, The hotels  has a lot of  charm,the  bedrooms  are nicely decorated  with black and white portrait , the owner Christophe is always there to accommodate your need. I  will be back next year and recommend this place not only for  the atmosphere but also for its value."
4135,"Clearly attempting a Philippe Starck look with crazy grand piano taking up luxurious space in a tiny foyer, and the blinding use of white on every surface,   this hotel is all too try hard.   Location is polarising. On the one hand it is convenient to the expo (about a 10 min walk) and its located directly above the subway station. But on the other stores and restaurants are not on the hotels doorstep. There is definitely a remote feel to the hotel. Bar is small and public spaces virtually non existent so options outside hotel important.    Room was small for Asian standards, but clean and everything there you would want. Shower in bath which I positively HATE!   Breakfast worst Ive had in a long time. Poorly run,hot food was cold, crowded. As is typical of China, 15 staff in…"
4136,"Mixed feelings about this hotel, overall just missed the mark for me.  I think there is definitely value for money, location is good.  Breakfast was ok although quite busy and not a huge selction.  Rooms were ok although the standard room just looks out to the bus stop so keep that in mind when comparing prices with other hotels.  And be warned, although they advertise ""Free Wifi"", after a 5 week stay across Europe it has the honorary award of THE worst internet I have experienced. I have had better internet in 3rd world countries, it was unusable to the point we just didn't bother and used data on our phones.  We told the front desk who said they would look into it and thought it may have been our room, however I don't believe it was islocated to our room as WIFI stregth was…"
4137,"When you first enter the hotel and go to the lobby - you'll say to yourself 'wow this is great' until you go to your room and realise that 'grand' feeling ends there (at the lobby!). The room and the furnitures are old. We are in 2019 and yet there are no power outlets near the bed that you can use to charge your phone. I've used the one under the desk BUT hey, you have to kneel and crawl to get to it! So upsetting.   Now let's talk about the shower. People take a bath so you feel and smell clean, right? But in Langham - OMG the water from the shower smells like it has been sitting like ages in an old container. It stinks! Then the huge towel - old and doesn't smell good either.   Overall, there is no 5-star feeling in this hotel apart from the grand entrance. Beds are big and…"
4139,"Modern, quirky hotel in excellent location for site-seeing. Staff very friendly and helpful. Good choice for breakfast; nice spicy food in Avan although service was slow on Friday evening when we arrived. Rooms clean and comfortable; quiet - didn't experience any noise from elsewhere. Overall would recommend and would happily stay there again on future trips."
4140,"A group of us stayed at the Excelsior for a business meeting with colleagues coming from Sao Paulo, US and UK. Five out of twelve people went down with food poisoning and were out of action for 3 days of the 5 day meeting. Food is buffet style, left out in the heat. Air conditioning also smells dreadful in the rooms, which have little natural light. Internet is over 50 reais a day to use, nearly £20 which is extortionate. We were testing the hotel for a big event later in the year and will definitely not be using it again or recommending it."
4142,"So wife and I just got back from staying at the Pittsfield. Let me give you an unbiased opinion. It's not a 3 Star in any way. The recent review in March was pretty spot on. If you're looking for the traditional hotel, this is not it. Is it clean? Basically. It's old. Someone took an Art Deco building and is calling it a hotel. It's a beautiful old building in need of a lot of work. There is no maid service and you have to take out your own trash. The air conditioner works well if you leave your bedroom doors open (rm. 1804). The mattresses are hard as rocks, so if you like firm... The building is sprinklered so we felt a little safer, but the smoke detector was not working. No traditional front desk and no phone, no pool, old furniture, room safes that were not secured. Motel 6…"
4143,"If you need Mercure in SP downtown go for M Paulista. E I stayed there dozen of times. Breakfest services both selection and quality were very poor. During the day the house keeping staf ocupied both lifts same time, while to get any privilage attached to Accor platinum card I had to argue with reception. The claustrophobic reception and heavy construction next door didn't help to get better expirience too although hard to blame the staff."
4144,"Friendly welcoming staff, clean rooms, comfy bed and pillows, good shower and big towels, nice toiletries. Coffee making machine a hassle, the kettle would be much better, not much of a view. Great location for shops, food and transport and sightseeing"
4145,"I wish I had spent more time reading the reviews for this hotel.  I went with the overall score and that isn't always the best indicator it appears.  I travel a lot and have reasonable expectations in where I stay.  This hotel, whilst in a pretty good location (near the Financial District and a short walk and Metro from The Bund and shopping areas) and with good rooms, was let down substantially by the lack of customer service.  Most of staff are simply not bothered in assisting or even allowing enough time for a guest to finish their requirements.  The only exception being the room service, which was always delivered with a smile.  I definitely would not recommend this hotel to anyone. It has great potential but is let down by what should really be the bare essentials when it…"
4146,"This was a very nice hotel with friendly and helpful staff. It was very clean and the WIFI was reliable and fast. The room was a little small, which I think is probably typical. It wasn't an issue. It is located in a neighborhood that is not full of tourists. It was nice to get away from the tourist atmosphere each day. It is located conveniently close to a couple of metro stations. "
4148,Recently refurbished this small hotel is very comfortable and perfectly located in the heart of Paris. The room was clean and nice. Personnel is very kind and available to answer questions and solve issues. Lightening of the room could be improved 
4149,"Kenton Palace Hotel is a real tour-group hotel -- packed to the gills with tour groups rushing into and out of the hotel.  Located in walking distance to the main plaza (Mayo Avenue) and walking street shopping area (Florida Avenue), the hotel is relatively well located.  Rooms could be cleaner due to heavy traffic. Service was poor - inadequately staffed for the demands of large tour groups and breakfast was exceedingly slow.   Breakfast was quite terrible - a very sparse offering with long waits for refills due to heavy tour group demand.  Definitely not a palace."
4150,"great location, walking distance to many tourist sights like museum island, tourist ferry is right outside the door. s and u trains are just a few yards away, nice room, bed very comfortable. helpful staff, bar prices a bit high."
4151,"I have spent many nights here (maybe for ridiculous reasons, but never mind). But the core compliment one can make to this hotel is that it works. From a pragmatic perspective, things function, things are easy, the rooms are nice and functional, there is high-speed internet available, and all is well. From an aesthetic perspective, it may be worth mentioning that Helmut Jahn's team designed the place, and it did a good job. So with ups and downs (the price could potentially be included in the latter category), I highly recommend the place."
4152,"The hotel is basic but very efficient and friendly. It is across the Stationsplein in Amsterdam which is convenient if you are taking the train. From the hotel one can walk to a number of attractions, restaurants, supermarkets, etc. The streets around are busy with pedestrians and cerybsafe. There is a large supermarket around the corner. The hotel offers breakfast but because I left very early I didn’t have a chance to try it out. The reception staff was friendly, quick and helpful. The room had a view of the street but was quiet. For a quick stay, this is a good choice. The amenities in the room are limited and the beds are adequate. Please note that when you book a double bed, it is two small twins put together. The room was big but very sparsely furnished, which makes it…"
4153,"We stayed here for three nights and on all three mornings we had cold showers. The first morning was very cold water due to a maintenance failure per the front desk - OK, these things do happen.  However, the next two mornings when we got up at 8:30am, the hot water had run out, leaving very cool water.  The heater they put in could obviously not keep up with demand.  That is not excusable.  Only weak apologies from the front desk each time I called.    At checkout, they offered $15 discount on the $175 daily rate and after push-back another $50 was taken off the total bill.  The manager stayed behind the scenes and did not show face, leaving the clerk to deal with it - not impressive.  I value a hot shower in the morning as half the value of staying in a hotel - obviously they…"
4154,"I travel a lot with work and stay in hotels very often. I was visiting Sweden for a week with my family and needed to be close to the Kista area so settled on picking the Scandic Victoria Tower as it looked fairly good. On walking up to the hotel, it looked visually impressive! A massive 'T' shaped glass building that could be seen from quite a distance! I parked my car in the car park in front of the hotel and went to check-in. We got the room keys and went up to our rooms. The staff didn't properly set up one of the cards so we had to go back downstairs to get a new room card (not a great start but I was willing to let that slide). The room was pretty average, decent natural light comes in, looked fairly clean but the problem we found was the hotel really let itself down when…"
4155,"Comfort is the key word. Quiet, comfortable bed, large choice of breakfast. Care of the personnel (for example at Breakfast, the concierge or the room service), remarkable. Because when you stay away from home, you want to feel safe and comfortable. Not a choice, an evidence"
4156,"Modern feel hotel, reasonable location in quiet area.  Good transport connections in to city centre (U6) and museum island (M5) plus flat walk to most key locations including city centre.  Reception sells day tickets for transport.  Good range of restaurants and utility shops in immediate area that suited our needs including chemist, bio supermarket and ATM.  Laundromat accessible by tram.  Young, friendly and helpful staff. In-house continental breakfast was not unreasonable at 10 euros each but no other meals covered.  Range of cafe options nearby.  Some issues in our Junior suite room  1. Had a kitchenette but no pans, utensils, crockery, cutlery, etc.  We didn't need them so didn't ask; inquire before booking.   2. Lumpy pillows. 3. Shower over bath was tricky to operate,…"
4157,We stayed only 1 night in the nh hotel. The receptionist Mara was really friendly and smiling all the time. The room was clean and had comfortable beds. The enjoyed the breakfast and will recommend the hotel to friends and family.
4158,The sheets were scratchy and dirty.  I could hear the people walking above us  and the doors slamming in the corridor.  Hardly got any sleep at all.  Staff was rude when I called to complain about it.  Don't stay here.
4159,"I have stayed here three times in 2015 for company trips. This hotel was not my choice.  Lobby Looks old, shabby, weird. Have you ever been to a carnival? Did you catch the last season of AHS: Freak Show? YUP, that would describe the lobby of Hotel Triton. It looks like a place someone who thinks they are cool would stay because they can tell their friends there are hoola hoops in the lobby.  Staff Nice, but clueless. Laid back, ditzy. DO NOT CARE if you have a problem. NONE of them are trained to handle customer complaints. I will get to this later. But lets just start off by saying I was sent to someone else's room upon checking-in. That was fun!  The Rooms. TALK ABOUT A DUMP!!! --EVERYTHING IS OLD. The carpet is so old and gross. DO NOT WALK BAREFOOT. --All three rooms I have…"
4160,"The best thing about this hotel is the location, it is right in the center of everything! Close to the beach, marina and La Rambla. From reading other reviews it seems we were lucky and got quite a spacious room with a small balcony. The room was average, however the bed wasn’t great and we only had one bottle of water in the room on day of arrival and then they were never replaced and no tea/coffee.  The hotel is on a main busy road but this didn’t really bother us as the location was so good.  The staff at reception were brilliant and very helpful.  Overall we had a pleasant stay and would recommend this hotel if you are on a bit of a budget. "
4161,"Just visited the Hotel Colette in Cannes for a 3 night stay, amazing little hotel. The staff were friendly and attentive from start to end.  The hotel is directly opposite the train station in Cannes, just cross the road and you are at the door. We flew into Nice airport, jumped onto the free tram at the airport which dropped you near Nice St Augustin train station and 35 minutes and 6 euros later you are at this hotel. We arrived just after 2pm and was allowed to check in a little earlier than the planned 3pm, this gesture in itself was very much appreciated. The hotel offers free afternoon tea between 2:30pm - 8:30pm, we were placed on the floor where the breakfast room was, so handy for popping along for a cup of tea. We stayed on a room only basis without breakfast but we…"
4162,"Hard to know where to start really. The hotel is in a good location, not far from town. There is a courtesy bus running monday to Friday, starting at 10am. The sea view rooms are great, lovely view, good balconies with great privacy, but no drying rack for washing. Beds are large and very comfortable, the rooms are reasonably quiet. The decor of the rooms is off putting however, lots of grey and black with lots of glass surfaces.  There is a tatty grey rug which has seen better days and a grey sofa.  First impressions are depressing.  The bathrooms are a good size but mirrored which is very off-putting when using the toilet. Good storage in bedrooms.  Two tatty, threadbare gowns, which I was shocked by.  This is supposed to be  5 STAR hotel!! Two swimming towels are provided. …"
4164,I have stayed for 2 nights for a business trip. The rooms are big enough. The towels are so soft and clean compare to other 5 star hotels. You need to take taxi to the city center but you can walk from the river side by walk. The breakfast is good. You can have alternative bread and cheese. Fresh juice options are also available. The personal is friendly too. İf you will only use the hotel for a good night sleep and shower it is really good. 
4165,"Fantastic hotel with great amenities, amazing breakfast in walking distance of entire town.  Loved staying her although the service at the rooftop restaurant and bar could be better.  Breakfast was much better than expected and hotel staff was super nice and very helpful especially the concierge who arranged all dinner reservations and touring for us. Would stay here again in a second."
4166,"We stayed here in the summer and liked it. Location was prime. Service could have improved, but I think that is just Europe. Rooms are on the smaller side. Staff had difficulty speaking English but they did their best to help us. Super affordable during prime time summer and would stay here again."
4167,"Good points -  a short ride to beach and old town; many staff speak some english; shower worked well. Clean. Wifi up to 1.7Mb per day. Bad points - Down-town area - some people might not feel safe walking out at night. My room was noisy due to windows not closing properly and lack of sound insulation in the corridor. Pool too small for a hotel of this size. Breakfast was poor - mainly cakes and processed cheese and vapid ham that you would avoid in the supermarket. Do not expect cooked tomato, mushroom bacon and so on. Service in the lobby bar was slow both times we used it, even though it was not crowded. The second time, after a 15 minute wait  we went to the reception desk to order! The receptionoist told us it would be another 5 minutes until someone from the bar could take…"
4168,"This hotel is centrally located, had a great breakfast in the morning. However, the room was SMALL for 2 people. I know that European hotel rooms are not large, but was hard to find where to put suitcase. The bathroom was pretty basic. Apparently some folks had bathtubs and bidets. We had a shower with NO LEDGE or anyplace to put shower gel, soap, shampoo, etc except the floor. So if you go there, check the bathroom of your room first.  The bar and restaurant don't open until 730 (restaurants don't usally open until 7 or 730 in Portugal) so if you want a drink before dinner, you have to wait and then have dinner late. I would find a different hotel in the future if I went back to Portugal."
4169,"Very very disappointed with Hilton! If this is the new Hilton I’m done! You really need to get a grip, this hotel would be an embarrassment to Holiday Inn or Red Roof Inns or Best Western. I can not believe what I paid for this dump!"
4170,"This was our first stay in a Hilton hotel and I have to say it was a beautiful hotel, great service and topped it all by the sheer location. Right next to a underground tube station and across the road from hop on and hop off buses. Beautiful view if you ask for front side. We had a lovely time in Berlin and the hotel was great,  only downsides I would say is the bottled water in the mini bars should be free as I was charged to much for just water and one evening we had some food from the bar which was very poorly presented and didn't look appetizing especially for a hotel of this stature."
4171,"The hotel was recommended to us by a friend who lives in Paris and we were not disappointed. Charming hotel. Staff booked an amazing restaurant for our first night. Very friendly, informative staff, ensuring that we had an amazing break. Fantastic position in heart of monmartre"
4172,"Due to my work I travel a lot and go to many hotels. Up until now I always used Tripadvisor to choose my hotels according to the reviews; however, I have always been lazy to write my own comments about a hotel I'd stayed in. But SF suites made me change my laziness and actually write something about it. Overall the facilities of the hotel are good. I stayed in the ""suite familiar"" and it's a nice 1 bedroom apartment of Buenos Aires. Lacking of few things (such as linen for the 2 couches, I assume  you have to ask for it if you need to have ""family"" in your room, and if you are lucky and can handle the inoperativeness of the front desk skills, maybe you'll get them), there are no dish towells in the kitchen and small things). The area is ok. I dont blame the noise because that is something that you need to expect if you happen to stay downtown Buenos Aires. The room I stayed in is not facing the street so maybe the noise is lower. They put 2 glass windows (not really pro ones) and that helps isolate the noise. The view is not nice (but expect that to other 3 or even 4 stars hotels in Buenos Aires). The very negative side of this hotel is the STAFF and the conditions they give to guests. They make you pay at the check in, and when you ask why, they tell you that EVERY HOTEL does it. Well, apparently they havent been around to other hotels so much, because most of the hotels all over the world, they dont do that. I suggested them to put that information in the website, and Laura (front desk most incapable person I have ever met and she is also proud of it) mentioned they dont do that because is not right (go figure). If guests know that they are going to be charged in advance, maybe they'll think twice.  I didnt pay when I did the check in because I had dollars and it was 3 am, so I said the next day I will pay. Then next day another front desk ""inoperative"" and rude clerk that works at night reminds me in a very ""nice"" way that I need to do this right away. As I told him: I wont run off and i am not thief (that's how I felt). I have few other stories like these in the 4 days I stayed here but they go beyond the review. If you stay here expect the staff to be rude, unpolite, they treat you like you are a thief and you owe them something because they are giving you their time. They like to fight back even when they are wrong and they refuse to apologize when they make mistakes (Laura gave me the total of 5500 pesos first and I told her to check again and then the bill suddenly came down to 1500 pesos but hey....who sees the difference??) She didnt even acknowledge her mistake. Cleaning service happens sporadically. Out of 4 days they came in once.  Again, hotel is nice, staff makes it a 1 star hotel.…"
4173,"The front desk staff is either friendly, or some of them are not pleasant at all. Also the bar connected, the bartender is the slowest and worst I've ever dealt with. As far as the room it's clean and nice, although the rooms on the fourth floor felt like an institution. The only amazing thing was the internet, it was beyond great."
4174,"Hotel in business district, 40 minutes by taxi to the Bund, cost approx 100 yuan and traffic extremely heavy all the time. Metro station a very long walk from hotel. Nothing in hotel vicinity but businesses. Aircon appalling, didn't work, fan provided, room temp in early May 27 Celsius, wifi appalling in room. Rooms comfortable and great buffet breakfast but staff very unaccommodating. Wanted to charge 50 yuan to borrow hotel umbrella to walk 100 metres. Would not recommend hotel if you want to sightsee Shanghai due to location."
4175,"Due to my daughter being rushed to hospital I made a quickly booked trip to Cannes. Elisabetta and her family couldn't be more accommodating and empathetic to my plight even feeding me home cooked focaccia on arrival very late after visiting the hospital. It was gorgeous! This is a wonderful place, I love the fact that it feels like a home with the extended family being around including Jimmy the dog. I have yet to taste Xaviers cooking but hope to be able to manage an evening meal soon."
4176,"Excellent Value, clean, modern, quiet. I lived here for 6 weeks, train was very conveniently out my front door. Safe area with food stores within walking distance. The staff is friendly and helpful. The weekly cleaning is excellent and each room has a Nespresso machine with coffee. The kitchens are stocked very well and the dishwasher was great."
4177,Hotel is located 25 minutes from centre and 30 minutes from Brandenburg gates the subway staion is 3 minutes away while train station is 8 minutes avay. It is very niceli managed hotel especially the rooms are very clean and well kept. The reception could be a bit more flexible and happy to see you. Hotel is a very good selection for a nice Berlin trip. Take rooms a bit highet tan first floor if possible to avoid noise from the road.
4178,"Big room & comfortable Also,  upgrade me to nice room  I apperciate that and i would like to thanks the reception women i forget her name,  she was so kindly and helpful May be i come back to this hotel in the future"
4179,"Big hotel, modern rooms and rich breakfast menu, prices are really good and reasonable for the quality provided.. The service and the staff are very good. I believe it’s quite central and accessible (in Berlin standards), close to the nightlife in Schöneberg and not too far from the Brandenburger Tor and the surrounding attractions..."
4180,"Typical of the 25hours chain, this hotel is cool. Great design across the board. Friendly and professional staff in the lobby area. The rooms are well-designed and funky and ours had a view of the zoo, with lots of light. Guest access to Monkey Bar on the roof, so you don't have to stand in line."
4181,"I expected a lot from this hotel when seeing the reviews, however I was let to be disappointed. Service and the staff are amazing, otherwise the hotel does not match with the reviews. Location is biggest negative thing and all the redneck Chinese people is the second. The wifi did not work properly."
4182,"I came here on business but my family also came in tow and the reception staff was happy to upgrade the occupancy and extra bed at a reasonable extra charge. Rooms were very comfortable and shower nice and powerful. Cleaning staff did a great job with the room but did not check the mini bar which has old food left from the previous occupant which we had to dispose of ourselves. There was an espresso machine in the room but no tea, which we missed being Brits. Breakfast had good variety but average in quality. However, the location could not be beaten. It's right opposite the cathedral with its massive pedestrianised square and is 7 minutes walk to La Ramblas and Passeig di Garcia with all the tourist attractions, shops and restaurants. Barcelonetta beach is within walking…"
4183,"My husband and I have just returned from three nights at H+ Hotel Berlin Mitte. It was our first time visiting Berlin and we were both really happy with our choice of hotel!   Pros: - Friendly, helpful staff - Great location, which felt safe, trendy and was within 20 mins easy walk of the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag; we hardly used the metro station (which is nearly directly opposite the hotel if the weather is bad and/or you don't want to walk) - Clean, bright, air conditioned/heated double room with a comfortable bed, modern furnishings and a fab shower - Great buffet breakfast included in the price of the room with lots of options including cereals, fruit, yoghurts, toast, eggs (boiled and scrambled), bacon, sausages, meatballs, pancakes, cold/smoked meats, salads,…"
4184,The maid found a pistol in my luggage and turned it over to the police who refuse to give it back to me even though I did not break any laws.  First off I don't carry a pistol very often but Chicago is a bit out of my comfort zone.  I didn't want to leave it in my car for three days so I took it to my room.  I did not realize there was a safe so I left it in my bag.  I was told my pistol was left laying in the middle of my bed and the maid found it.  This is ridiculous.  It was in my bag which apparently they went through in my room.  Very UPSET.  I was also not pleased to find out Self Parking was $56 a night.  DO NOT STAY HERE.
4185,"We played the tourists in Berlin during a week last April and we picked this hotel, because it seemed centrally located. It was indeed a very good choice. We can not complain at all about anything, we were very satisfied. The breakfast buffet is really worth a visit ! My only remark would be that there should be a children rate for this. In fact it's not quite cheap and children often do not value this amount of choice/food, hence some waste of money. We ended up picking every next morning a new nice cafe nearby (there are quite a few in the area), this was in my opinion a reasonnable alternative, which I can recommend."
4186,"This rooms  in this hotel are small, but clean and functional. The rooms themselves are what you would expect for the price of the hotel however, the facilities, most notably, the pool and spa, are quite dirty and are in dire need of a refurbishment"
4187,"We had a nice stay in the hotel during three days. The building interior has gardened it's magnificant old glory. Super. Excellent and kind service. Only a short walk to bus, train, or subway.Location in the hart of Berlin. TOP !!"
4188,"I had booked a privilege category room which was located on the 6th floor. The room itself was nicely decorated and spacious. To mention the special shoe cabinet, and bull's eye window in front of the small writing desk. A daily free bottle of water and newspaper was included in the rate, the bed was comfy and the bathromm fairly small but modern and functional. Staff was friendly and helpful.  What I didn't like was especially that the room was located next to the elevators well, so you could here it going up and down all day long - and also during night which was quite disturbing. So better get a room far away from the elevator! Besides that  they also have those old fashioned keys instead of a magnetic key cards which nowadays is standard in hotels -  and also the heating was…"
4189,"I had great expectations of this hotel.  The hotel is well located and has recently been built (within the last few years I think)  We paid approx 100 euro per night for a sea view room which includes breakfast   Here are the positives -  Rooms are big, siem with great sea views Pool area is big Hotel is located right on the beach and has its own private beach area Location is good, only 5 mins to night market by taxi  Staff at reception are very nice, but not all staff speak sufficient English  Staff did react quickly to our complaints and did their best to remedy them.  We got upgraded to a bigger room for free  Here are the negatives -   Lobby areas don’t have air conditioning Lifts don’t have air conditioning  Shower pressure is weak Breakfast is not good quality In some…"
4190,"I chose this 'resort' because it was located away from Mui Ne centre. This turned out to be a big mistake. Firstly it's a $15 taxi from the centre or a local bus. When I arrived the place was deserted, it was like a ghost town.  The room itself was fine and not badly priced compared to other resorts but this place is not really a resort. There is a bar, a pool and beach frontage but there are no sun lounges on the beach or nicely manicured gardens to relax inn. It's the bar, the pool or your room.  As per the other reviews Hoang is very friendly and welcoming. I did enjoy the evening dinners, it was a good way to meet the other guests, the few who were staying there.  The kite surfing lessons with Sebastien were good. They are $50 an hour and are two hours long.  My biggest…"
4191,"We found the quickest way to get to his hotel was to arrive at the Sao Sebastiao Metro station (Red line from the airport). On leave the train, we didn’t follow the people up the escalators towards the Blue line but went in the opposite direction up the stairs. On exiting the ticket gate, we took the left side exit up the stairs to the outside. We come out were the Av. Duque Avila meets the Rua Marques de Fronteira. We turned right to go down the R. Marques Sa da Bandeira and walked down to the second street, Av. Miguel Bombarda. We crossed over and the hotel was on the left a short walk down.  We stayed on the 8th floor a few rooms down the left side corridor after exiting the lift. The room was facing the back and below we could see the large air-conditioning system. We asked…"
4192,"We really enjoyed our stay at the hotel. It is close to everything, train station Nation 400m away and it's very safe and the area is nice. Room is clean, small but this is Paris and the bed is very nice. would recommend staying here. "
4193,"Stayed with my children over the weekend as apart of a trip to see Barcelona v Atletico Madrid at the Nou Camp. The triple room and bathroom were spotlessly clean. Breakfast was free and was great. The Front of House team were ever so helpful, friendly and professional. The location was a few minutes walk to the Metro.   My tip is to walk out of the hotel and turn right. Walk down for about 25 minutes where you will get to the beach. Nice walk along the promenade as well as a plethora of eateries."
4194,"My boyfriend and I recently stayed at this hotel for four nights and we had no complaints! We arrived early in the morning after our flight hoping to just drop off our bags and it was a pleasant surprise that our room was ready ahead of schedule!  The room was quite small but that is to be expected in Europe so that was not an issue. It was cozy and very clean. The location is absolutely wonderful, being near many great restaurants (try Le Cosy and Nona Rita!) and a quick walk to two metro stations.  The breakfast each day was very tasty as well!"
4195,"We didn’t want to spend a lot of money because we would be in Lisbon only one night before catching a plane home.  This hotel fit the bill.  It was clean, and the staff was very nice and helpful.  The breakfast, included in the price, was minimal but okay.  Our room was on the front, and the hotel, while being close to the “Eating Lane,” was quiet as opposed to our room at the Residencial Florescente where we had stayed three nights the week before.  The only problem was the temperature in the public areas, which was very hot, but we could control the temperature in our room, so that was not a problem.  The location is excellent, and the price is right for a clean, basic hotel that is convenient to most everything."
4196,"My expectations were definitely not met during our stay for our honeymoon.  We had to ask more than once to get new shampoo and conditioner.  Also, when ordering room service there was always one item missing.  When you pay $90 for a breakfast for two I would expect nothing to be missing.  Also, no one told us about the $40 per day charge to park the car.  Had we known that we would have parked offsite and walked.  Will not stay at a Four Seasons again."
4197,"Worst hotel I’ve ever stayed in. Reception was unfriendly. After a long drive, I just wanted to go to the washroom but check in lines were so long. I asked if I could go to the washroom (locked) and the receptionist was super rude- with a glare, she said NO you need to wait in line even though I already told her. This hotel was located in an an unsafe area- dark, dingy with lots of homeless and dealers around (we saw several exchanges). It is not that close to union square as the map makes it seem. I have done lots of solo travel and here, I would not have been comfortable walking around on my own. MAybe this is why staff were so rude? They have to deal with stragglers?   The rooms were outdated; hallways looked like something from the SHINING. Needless to say, book somewhere…"
4198,Quick check in. Friendly and helpful staffs. Nice rooftop pool and bar. Great place to relax before going out for the night.  Spacious and quiet lobby area. Excellent drinks at the bar. The bathroom is a little small. Room is clean. Great location.
4201,Great location indeed. Friendly environment. A few things to improve: room 460 toilet privides constant bed smell. Matrasses are extremely hard to sleep. We would appreciate signs on the corridor walls and elevator walls/doors like „keep quiet between 10pm and 8am“ as people areVERY NOISY during the nights and the doors do not isolate the sounds at all. 
4202,"Room overlooking the marina was lovely, large balcony which got the sun in the afternoon..  Room was fitted with a kitchen, and plenty of pots and pans and cutlery were available.  The room was very clean (although a couple of times the cleaners came to us late, one day at 6pm) Hotel reception had the look of a hostel. One very small bar area. We stayed bed and breakfast and it was a basic choice of breakfast at that. Definitely no choice for children at all.  We ended up having our breakfast out at a local restaurant.  The swimming pool area is covered with brick tiles that were broken away and lifted up in several areas and as you had to walk through the pool area to get to our room, you had to watch your step, especially at night.   Lagos is lovely and there are plenty of…"
4203,"I traveled with 2 young kids and kitchen was crucial for our stay (and, probably, the main factor during hotel search), as well as 2 separate rooms (bedroom+living room). Family suites are well-located at the far end of the corridor, with floor-to-ceiling windows, fully equipped kitchen with nice cutlery and plates of various sizes and shapes. Rooms are not cleaned (cleaning can be ordered for extra pay), while towels can be changed free of charge at request. Both rooms have enough lights and look nice, but the living room couch and armchair seemed quite old. Bed linen were perfectly white and fresh, seemed like new. Bathroom has no amenities except shower gel. Sound proofing is so good that it always seemed that the hotel is empty, but we regularly met quite many people in the…"
4205,"Excellent location. Within waking distance to Checkpoint Charlie (less than 5 mins), Jewish Museum (10 mins), Topography of Terror (15 mins), Berlin Wall memorial (10 mins), Potsdam Platz (20 mins) and many other attractions. Bahn stop is literally right outside the hotel and you can go to all the attractions easily from there.  Many cafes and restaurants within walking distance.  Rooms are much bigger compared to other places in Europe. Comfortable beds and pillows. The building itself is a little old so there is a distinct smell in some areas but overall we had a wonderful stay."
4206,"Really lovely venue with a cool vibe, friendly staff. Great location would definitely stay here again! Went for a buisness trip with great breakout areas, but would be great for a friends or solo trip as well."
4207,"On our way to Warnermunde, two nights stay to check out the great history of Berlin. An easy cab ride from the airport to hotel and just across the Hauptbahnhof  and the trams stop, The room was small compared to traditional hotels.Request for king bed had two singe beds as it was 1100 PM in the night  and traveling almost 22 hours of flying from Melbourne Australia  did not the bother to wait & change rooms. Minibar in room which came in handy at that time of the night. Its the location  & the a good nights sleep that matters when on holidays. The buffet breakfast with a fantastic spread was great which made up for the beds, so not complaining about it.  A few restaurants around the corner and more selection at the station and the roof top bar."
4208,"Great location, clean room, big bathrooms! Closest subway is the opera station.  Close to galleries Lafayette and tourist spots!!!  My second time staying there and always such a great room to rest in after a long day of walking!!  "
4209,"Overall I wouldn't classify this hotel as a 4-star accommodation. It was in a convenient location (steps away from bus and train stations and only 5-10 minute walk to city center) but overall it was outdated and not very comfortable. Rooms were old and beds were hard. Furniture appeared from the 80s/90s and TV was the tiniest ~10"" flat screen. Breakfast was good with a variety of breads/pastries, eggs, cold cuts, cheese and fresh fruits. Overall, I might stay at another place closer to the beach with more luxuries (updated decor/furniture, nicer beds, blackout curtains, gym, etc.)"
4210,"We stayed in a superior double room for 4 nights. The staff was super friendly and helpfull. I had written in advance and asked them to put extra pillows and a hairdryer in the room and everything was ready when we arrived. The rooms are small, yes, but we found it perfect for a couple or a single person staying there. The bed was sooooooo nice to sleep in! Bathroom is small as well, but very nicely decorated and the shower was really nice with good water pressure and different options, both a hand-held shower head and one in the cealing. The room was very clean every day, towels changed etc. It is a few minutes walk from Republique or the metro Jaque Bonsergant with perfectly easy acces to everywhere you want to go in Paris. It is located in a street with multible café's and a…"
4211,Felt very welcome and accommodated by staff. Responded and delivered quickly on last minute requests. The room was comfortable with a great view over the city. Only downside at all was the wet floor after a shower. The free sauna downstairs was a nice added bonus. Would definitely stay again. Thank you to the staff.
4212,"The guest service as this hotel was very friendly & helpful.  I arrived early and my room was ready without any mishaps.  The girl at the front desk was very patience showing me how to use the tram/train service.  There is a supermarket not too far, so you can get extra water any stuff w/o having to travel far."
4213,Not too bad. Good location nice reception. But dirty bedsheet. We paid more than 400euro for 2 nights and this is not acceptable at all. For the rest not too bad stay. Small room but nice. I don t like glass on the bathroom
4214,"Good things first. When I arrived I had a good impression of the hostel. It's quite small and the staff seemed to be friendly and helpful. Cleanliness of the bathrooms was not outstanding but okay and there were big lockers in the dorms (even though mine was pretty dirty). The location was not bad, just a few blocks from the Subte.  I got very disappointed though when I wanted to pay for the nights I stayed. My connecting flight to BsAs got cancelled so I couldn't stay the first night I originally booked. I called from London and told them that I would get there a day later and when I arrived I also told them that I would leave one day earlier than planned. When I wanted to pay the guy at reception told me that 'por cortesía' I didn't have to pay for the first night but he still…"
4215,"My teenaged daughter and I spent 8 nights at Hotel Chavanel in March. I did a lot of research before choosing this property and I was not disappointed! The experience from start to finish was excellent! The room, while smaller than those found in North America, was large by European standards and was decorated in a very chic and modern style. The bathroom was large and the shower was excellent - great water pressure and temperature!! We had a lovely view of Rue Tronchet and the large windows open completely which gives the feel of having a balcony. The staff were friendly and helpful (especially as my French is weak to say the least!!) and the location was perfect - the Metro is on your door step, the shopping at Blvd Haussmann is a block away and the Louvre, Musee D'orsay,…"
4216,"I spent a night at Monsieur Cadet Hotel & Spa upon my arrival to Paris. The room I stayed was quiet & comfortable. It came with a nice big bed with clean beddings, a big bath tub, lots of towels and a beverage tray with an electric kettle, a mini-fridge that is used as a mini-bar. The bed was comfortable and I slept well in it. Mattress is a real bed mattress, not a memory foam. Also the room faces to the court yard, and the noise from the outside is shut off. Very quiet and pleasant room.   I would like to say special thanks to Lauren, Abul and Elena. I was upgraded to stay in a better room. Lauren warmly welcomed me when I walked into their hotel lobby. She was very friendly and helpful during the check-in process. Abul was quick-minded, he sensed that the room I was…"
4217,"Arrived for holiday here booked through First Choice - package deal. When we were dropped off at the hotel by the first choice/Thomson bus the receptionist greeted us with - Your room will be ready at 2pm, come back at 12.30pm for your wristbands. It was only 10.45 am. We then spent the next 4 hours in reception as unable to use any of the facilities or even get a drink. When we were allowed in our room we discovered that the bed provided for our 23 year old daughter was a camp bed big enough only for a child younger than 10years old. My husband immediately raised his concerns with reception - having paid £700 for each adult we didn't feel it was acceptable for any of us to sleep on a child size camp bed with a 1 inch mattress . The solution - the maid bought us a single bed…"
4219,"we wished we had booked somewhere closer to Porto town centre. In January, it was too cold to walk the 40 mins into town for dinner and we didn't want to get taxis everywhere. Breakfasts were great and so was the service. The hotel does provide a limited shuttle service. "
4220,We chose this hotel because it was close to the Zoo and because it has rooms with connecting doors as we were traveling with smaller kids. The hotel was nice and clean and the rooms were of an okay size. The breakfast was a bit boring and without standards like scrabbled eggs and bacon or sausages. Next time I’m in Berlin I’ll book a hotel near Alexanderplatz only due to the location
4222,"Like most South Beach hotels this property is woefully overpriced.  The rooms are tiny, the doors and walls are paper thin and paint is chipping everywhere.  The beds are uncomfortable and while the room is decorated it looks as if most of the items in the room haven't been moved or dusted in years.  The hotel staff was friendly some days and not others.  They attempted to change my room rate AFTER I'd checked in and a week after I returned home they tried to make me pay for water and snacks even though I couldn't check out until they checked the room and confirmed I did not use such items.    The hotel is in walking distance from Ocean Ave, the porch is nice and secluded and the hostess was nice but otherwise I can't truthfully find anything positive to say about the hotel.  If…"
4223,"Situated in the middle of the road between the Schonefeld airport and downtown Berlin, the hotel is more suitable for bigger groups and events than for solo travelers. Less than 10 minutes walk to the S-bahn station and a shopping centre, half an hour ride from Alexanderplatz. A little too far from the vibe."
4224,"Services could have been better, except one of their employees (Kavita) I could not find a person with prompt at given tasks. I will tell you about one of the incidents- I had called receptionist to inform there is smoke on 11th floor and if she can check what it is, couple of people turned up after 20 minutes of reporting and started asking me if I have smoked in my room. Apart from this food at breakfast table could be better. Except couple of things I couldn't find it even eatable (and also at food counter- I did order 3 omelets on both the days and they completely missed on serving it, so i had to remind them again and then I was given 2. )So if you are a 5 star hotel then these are very basic things which should have been promptly. So overall stay was more of a…"
4225,"Location, location, location.  Great for people who have short time to visit Barcelona and wants to stay at the heart of lovely city of Barcelona, close to shoppings, bar and restaurants. Rooms are so minimal and staffs are really nice young energetic people who are helpful. Breakfast room is small and there will be hiccups when they receive groups or on high season like easter. It is a very new hotel and I am sure there will be some improvements after the soft opening. "
4226,Very simple hotel in st martin canal area. In Paris visiting a family member in St Louis hospital and this hotel was perfect. Bedroom very small and dark with view over a light well..but compensated for by being very quiet. It was a single room so you get what you pay for. The staff were efficient. I extended my stay for a few nights and tgey were accommodating about letting me keep the room. Free coffee in reception very nice touch.  Would recommend especially if just looking for a place to lay your head. Easy access to gare du nord ..by which I mean I walked with my luggage. Equally you can walk to the Maraus easily. The canal area is a delight. 
4227,"We have had a very nice stay in this hotel. The location of the hotel is good, the staff was very friendly to us and the room was neat. This hotel is just completely renovated. We stayed in room Audacieuse. This is a small room, but had everything we needed. The bed is of very good quality! We could hear the air pressure of the metro but it didn't bothered us. We would recommend this hotel. If you would like to have a big room, I would reccommend you a bigger room than the Audacieuse."
4228,"We would never stay here again! The entire property is filthy dirty, very run-down and outdated. The paint in the rooms is pealing and the walls are EXTREMELY DIRTY! I have never seen a hotel/motel in this poor condition! The rooms are also very small and crowded. The two ""pros"" were: the desk clerk was friendly and it is a good location. Otherwise forget it!"
4229,"Very nice place. Helpful staff. The bar is built in a way that doesn't make it easy to socialize - just square, separate tables - could easily be much better. I took a private room with a friend and they only gave us 1 key & expected us to drop it in the reception every time we leave the hostel & pick it up every time we return to the hostel. That was EXTREMELY ANNOYING."
4230,inclusive breakfast is very pratical but once you stay more than a night it is every time the same closing @ 10am during the week is early once you are on vacation  hôtel team is friendly  restaurants around are affordable and offering fresh food
4231,Modern and clean Hôtel close to Berlin and Postam Excellent breakfast The swimming pool has not lot of sun and remains cool in Aygust Nice perssonel and shop arround open even late (until 22 pm) Easy to parck arround the hotel
4233,"Stayed for three nights approximately thirty minute taxi ride from the airport.  Check in was quick, staff very friendly all spoke good English.  The room was spacious, queen size bed, desk, armchair coffee table and balcony overlooking the sea.  Good sized bathroom with separate toilet. Clean and tidy rooms.  Would advise not to snack or drink from the mini bar (very expensive) hotel staff were attentive and provided excellent service.    Breakfast was good and offered a variety of options.    Good location and very enjoyable stay. "
4235,"Delight small hotel. Well appointed with good quality linens & amenities. Clean, quiet & convenient. Room rate includes good choices of cooked or continental breakfast. Room 54 had a private outdoor area too."
4236,"This was an absolutely excellent hotel! Good location (200m from Birkenstraße U-bahn), lovely clean modern room, €16 taxi from the airport, lots of places to eat and drink. Delphin restaurant very good for fish and there’s a bar opposite the hotel. "
4239,"Stayed here for two nights. The room was nice and suited our needs. It is a very good location and only a short walk away from a nice market and plenty of restaurants.  There is a parking just nearby, the first hour is free. There, you can park, check-in at the hotel, and then park your car somewhere else where it is for free.  And watch out for the funny bulldog, he is really cute and wants to be amused all day long!"
4240,"i was hoping Sofitel Hyland would not send me the post stay automatic email as it was obvious the stay was another major disappointment. but since they did, I guess its fair to say that the hotel has nothing to do with a sofitel. It is central for tourist (yet difficult to access) but the standards are those of a novotel/pullmann. understaffed Club lounge guarantees endless check in (supposedly VIP checkin but at least downstairs they have staff at front dest to assist). 45mn to get the room keys, usual Platinum benefits not granted. The Prestige suite was just a big joke....lets say that if you are on a good mood you may accept it to be called a junior suite. Renovated? Surely... but in a style that has disappeared everywhere since the 70's. Lounge food is more disappointing…"
4241,"At first glance the Enhotel Lido in Madiera has all of the facilities to be worthy of a 5 star rating, the rooms are large and comfortable, two swimming pools, gym. The food is excellent. The entertainment is woeful, very little variety and quality and insuffient. For the Xmas period we had to put up with both piped and live American Xmas Tunes-yuk. What is wrong with playing Portugese Music? The waiters and waitresses, bar and cleaning staff were brilliant. Apart from one fabulous receptionist, the others appear to have no local knowledge whatsover - ""I never go out"" was one comment. The biggest failing of the hotel is in their ""international dinner"" offerings. Madeiran Evening - an absolute disaster. Italian - very good first time as freshly prepared, the second time the food…"
4242,"We staged 2 nights with our grandchild at the hotel. Very well situated near 2 U - Bahn stations. Very friendly staff, near to shopping, restaurants and sightseeing places. The room was great, clean and very modern. Great bathroom."
4243,"Stayed here as part of an organised gardens tour. Asked for a room with a view expecting to see the sea, overlooked the car park in front of the Casino. No tea making in the room we did get a tray delivered with kettle, tea bags etc charged room service fee of 5euros when we needed more milk and tea bags!!!  On a rate including dinner on our last day, couldn’t change it to a cheaper snack to be taken in our room! Then they put dinner on our bill in the restaurant, I pointed it out and it was eventually removed! The room was tired old fashioned with very dated decor, dark corridors and lifts that seemed to be steam driven, slow!!! Only place to eat during the day is  out by the pool, what happens when it rains all day ,who knows. Pool cold so better in the indoor pool! View over…"
4245,"Overall our 1 week stay in condo with Garden (pool) view was OK.  But we had two issues I should point out. (1) We purchased (3) cardboard and insulation type coolers at Costco. We left 2 of them out and the maid service either threw them away, or took them for themselves. We discovered this in the early morning as we prepared to do the road trip to Hana. They were brand new, and we were surprised. We called the desk to let them know, then expected some sort of reimbursement. I spoke to the maid and she said she did not see them when she did towel service that day, so I replied that it must have been the day before then? She was silent. When we checked out I relayed the details to the manager and asked how he would handle this. He repeated what the maid said with blank eyes. I…"
4246,Fantastic hotel in great location. Alexanderplatz and lots of eateries just minutes away. Clean rooms (serviced daily) and friendly staff. Fantastic breakfast- would highly recommend.Would stay again when next in Berlin.
4247,"The room was too small and lacked lighting, bathroom was clean and decent size, breakfast had many options. Conference rooms were very small. The hotel staff was friendly and willing to help with requests."
4248,"As soon as we got there, the guys helped us get unloaded.  Then we waited a little bit to get checked in.  As soon as I heard the lady speaking, I KNEW she was sick.  She had a sore throat, and couldn't talk that well.  I really didn't want her to check us in, because I didn't want to risk the chance of either my husband or I getting sick. Which my husband is terminally ill with lung cancer,  and if he gets sick, and developes a fever, he can die.  Well, we BOTH got sick.  Thankfully he didn't get as sick as I did.  When I called the hotel management to tell them what had happened, she knew who checked us in, and said, yes she had a sore throught, and couldn't talk, but she wasn't sick.  Would you like to talk to her?  What's the point?  She would've argued she wasn't sick.  But…"
4249,"Very poor customer service. Called front desk and reported a loud beeping noise running for hours next to my room from ice maker machine. She said ok, I'll send someone (without any acknowledgment of my frustration and very cold tone). After an hour no body showed up and I called again. Again with a cold tone said ok, our engineer will be ther shortly! Again without any opology. Then I asked about a time estimate and she said I can't give you a time. I expect atleast an opology (a simple sorry), more visibility into when other than 'shortly' and atleast some options like changing room. Very disappointed!"
4250,"The location is convenient to shopping and the river, but I would trade convenience to never have to stay iat this hotel again. I arrived to a person standing next to a wall - she punched my name into a computer in the wall and my key cards came out of the wall like a bag of pretzels from a vending machine. I rode the elevator up to my floor and walked out into a dimly lit hallway. My room was down a maze like hallway. I found myself looking over my shoulder all the way to my room.  Once inside, I looked for a way to latch my door. No latch.  The room itself had the feel of a slightly upscale hostel. The bed small, but adequate.  The shower hospital like. Stray hairs on my bed quilt. Stains on the bathroom wall. Toilet clogged. The room furniture looked salvaged - the kind of…"
4251,"The room was clean, pretty spacious, and decorated very cute. The staff was super helpful. The location was maybe a 5 minute walk from alot of restaurants and bar options. The bathroom was a nice size as well, which isn't always the case. We definitely enjoyed our stay."
4252,"I stayed in Majestic hotel for 3 nights and I loved it. The hotel is in a great area where luxurious stores are, yet there are nice coffee shops and restaurants nearby. The hotel is only 10 minutes away from Rambla. We stayed in executive room on the 4th floor facing backyard away from noisy Main Street. The room was very spacious and comfortable.  I highly recommend this hotel to travellers however is very pricy. "
4253,"I visited the hotel for 4 nights with a group of 6 golf friends. This was about the 6th time Ive been. They had advertised a refurbishment. There was no evidence of this. We arrived at 1 am. Literally none of us could find our rooms on allocation. The signage and numbering system is like a Krypton factor test. I failed!!! On eventually accessing my room, the bed was covered by a sheet covered in decorating debris. I considered going back through the maze to complain but in exasperation I just threw the sheet into the corner of the room. This showered the floor with debris.  Also the wifi didnt work.  The next morning I complained about the state of the room and they said they would move me during the day while I was out playing golf.  One of my party (I had organised the stay)…"
4254,We stayed here for 3 nights from the 27th December and I would highly recommend this hotel. I picked a random 4 star hotel that was an attractive price on Hotels.com and I was delighted with my choice. We received a warm welcome and an upgraded room and I could find no faults with the hotel. I don’t really know Paris that well but I found the location to be perfect with plenty of bars and restaurants all within a 5 minute walk from the hotel and the République metro station was handy to get in central Paris for the main tourist attractions. Breakfast in the hotel was enough to give you a good start for the day and I would definitely stay here again if I returned to Paris
4256,"The hotel was overall a horrible experience, the floor was very dirty, my feet were brown when I got out of the shower, the room was in a horrible location when your trying to sleep, you can hear everyone coming in and out."
4258,"Booked the hotel online. Photos are matching reality. Friendly staff willing to help. Check-in and check-out very smooth. Immaculate clean room and the rest of hotel did not show any forgotten corners.  Did not use breakfast in hotel.  In France it is hardly up to expectation so we never do.  Hotel is close to Metro Convention which jumps you almost everywhere within 30 min.  Parking outside on streets is paid but you can find good carparks with reasonable prices for your stay.  Outside hotel is a street market on Tues/Thursdays.   Is is a welcoming area with supermarkets, greengrocers, bakeries and butchers.  To me it is an example of Paris as you imagine.  Would certainly recommend this hotel for private and business stays.   WiFi is good enough. Enrolment is slightly…"
4259,"After the recent restructuration of the rooms, the hotel is by far one of the best of the whole Passy quartier. Excellent quality of breakfast (although I didn't notice this time homemade cakes), very comfortable and silentious rooms. Staff ready to satisfy every request."
4260,"Very friendly staff, excellent room & breakfast...and a hammam! Sounds like a dream? No, it's real, and in the quite interesting neighborhood of Montmatre...amazing. Thx to the hotel staf for making a very romantic weekend a pleasant memory."
4261,On visiting Paris for the second time this year we spotted this quirky looking hotel on the internet and decided to book direct with them.  The hotel is based on the seven deadly sins and therefore each room as a theme (or rather each floor I think).  You can choose 3 'sins' you would prefer.  We were given the 'Lust' room on the top floor.  The reception is based on 'heaven' and is just amazing with unicorns and angel wings.  There is an honesty bar although we didn't have the time to use that. Downstairs in the basement is based on 'hell' and there is some sort of steam room in there also. I am not sure if you have to pay as again we didn't use it. The hotel is designed by Chantal Thomass and if you can speak fluent French there are videos in the lift and breakfast room with…
4262,We arrived late and took hotel near airport so we could explore what was best for a week stay the next morning.  OK the rates are modest but the hotel is really not worth even that amount. Photos make a dingy space sparkle. The rooms are clean but bed light does not work.
4263,Lovely Boutique hotel very well designed and decor in Berlin . Not very centrally located but next to the Berlin Zoo and amazing park. Hotel staff is so welcoming and great.Rooms are big enough with nice amenities and some of them have Zoo views where you could see the animals! Food and breakfast is delicious! We did a business meting there which was great with nice views to the Zoo ... not big meeting rooms but ok for 15 people meetings . In general an amazing stay for affordable price considering it is a 5 * hotel . I would definitely recommended and will for sure stay there next time i'm in Berlin
4264,"Would give more than 5 stars if possible. Stayed 2 nights absolutely perfect location, spotless rooms,very clean,very helpful staff. One of the most amazing hotels I’ve ever stayed. Will be back. Thank you for making our Paris experience very comfortable and as convenient as possible."
4265,"Very clean room, very good location close to center.  Very tasty breakfast.  Big balcony with a very nice view.  Quiet place. Comfortable beds and room which is equipped with all  needed facilities like iron, umbrella, etc.  Very good equipped kitchen. "
4266,"We were there a couple of weeks ago. I was very satisfied with the room, it was clean and tidy with comfortable bed. Unfortunately the traffic was so loud even during the night that we could not keep the windows opened, but still OK. One of the receptionists spoke only little in English, but he was helpful and kind. Still better then the guy from next day in the morning, with perfect English and very nice at first sight, but when asking kindly for help turns into arrogant and extremely busy to print out a simple doc from a website. Ech... anyway, except this ""service"" my whole stay was great, recommend, especially if you stay in Berlin only 1-2 days."
4267,"Lovely ground floor with vibrant activity, amazing new design and a brand new menu at the Inka restaurant apparently. The Mezcaleria (hidden bar) really is a gem, with tasty cocktails and a cool bar team. Rooms were very spacious and the AC was working quite well (which is nice with 42 degrees of outdoor temperature). Will probably go again in September for work."
4268,"The staff was really welcoming and friendly. If you had any question they were more than willing to help. The terrace was really nice and a great place to hangout during the evenings. Jet the room wasn’t clean enough - there were dust is the corners and dirty on the floor. The kitchen and the showers could need an upgrade and some more thorough cleaning. Very basic and boring breakfast. Also a fan is not good enough, so air conditioning in very room is much needed- couldn’t sleep because of the heat. That being said there was activity’s everyday and the pub crawl was a really good way to meet the other guests at the hostel."
4269,Luckily I was in Sampa Hostel just for a night. I could not have my shower because the bathroom was very dirty. The pillow was spotted of I don't know what. The breakfast was included but was a very poor breakfast. They have a chicken where you can cook. You have to adapt to stay in it.
4270,"Stayed here as part of a group. The staff was excellent, responsive to all questions and needs. Our room is extremely comfortable, clean, with everything we might need except perhaps better places to put our clothes. And the included breakfast is just superb. The hotel is within a few blocks of the waterfront, and the Who's town is within easy walking distance. All in all, a great experience."
4271,"Took part in the Big Berlin 25 race last weekend and stayed in this hotel with several friends. The hotel website has an online check in which I thought was excellent because when I arrived it reduced waiting time so I could go straight up to my room after receiving my key, winner! The room I stayed was good, clean bathroom, comfy bed and pretty spacious, however the room was too warm at night and the air conditioning didn't improve it by much so I had to open the window to cool the room down, but then the noise created by traffic disturbs you and my shower head kept on leaning to the left when turned on which was frustrating as I kept having to hold it myself when I had a shower. I thought the breakfast was good, muesli was tasty as were the selection of condiments to spread on…"
4272,"This morning I try to confirm details regarding the extra fees that some hotel charge daily.  The young lady operator i spoke to ufortunately could not answer such simple quetions. I asked her what are the extra fees that are charge daily and she continue to give me an answer that made no sense. Maybe english isn't her fist language or maybe she was incomptence. So she then connects me to reservation without even asking me to. When i got on the line with reservations, they could not answer my quetion  regarding the extra fees. So here comes my PROBLEM AND FRUSTRATION.I tried calling again and the operaator could not even a acknowledge my call. She continue to foward my call to reservations. i called the hotel almost FIVE times.I finally gave up and spoke to reservations and they…"
4273,"My husband and I, and another couple spent four evenings at the Hotel Luxembourg Observatoire. Our group are seasoned travelers of Paris, and we all agreed this was our favorite hotel so far.  First, the location is superb. Close to the Luxembourg Gardens and all across the street from a Metro stop. May restaurants and cafes in the area, we walked everywhere.   Second, the staff is friendly and very helpful. One of the men who work at the hotel actually fixed my friend’s broken eyeglasses when she asked him where to buy glue! The front desk works very hard to make everyone feel welcome and appreciated.  Third, while the rooms are quite tiny, they are charming. And the beds are comfortable. We lived the decorative style of the entire hotel: playful yet chic.  Lastly, the…"
4274,"I stayed in a double private deluxe room which was nice. Had a view of the canal and private facilities but didn't have any storage space to lay out my things. Also the door has a large space under which allowed the hallway lights to shine through and there was a weird wind sound the whole time. Shower was a bit annoying as it was a push button type and you had to keep pressing in order for it not to stop on you, as well as you couldn't control the water temperature. Staff was very friendly but I believe left in the early evening. The result was a very loud communal area which wasn't a problem for me but I felt sorry for the people staying in the ""shabby cabins"" (which friends of mine did) as it is literally just a box on one side of the communal room and can hear everything…"
4275,"According to various reviews online, this hotel has allegedly had multiple known cases of bed bugs.  Thought I am a huge supporter previously of IHG properties, you can add me to the list of those affected.  On a recent business trip, my colleagues and I stayed at this hotel.  The dated look to the property was not a show stopper, but worth mentioning.  Everything outside of the lobby area looks old.  However, the bed bugs found in my bed on the first morning that I woke up were enough to turn my stomach, ruin my trip and to this day force me to have my laptop and luggage quarantined in my garage, locked away tightly in garbage bags.  I'll likely throw them away instead of risking my house.    Feel free to search for ""Bed bug reports"", and type in this particular location.  If…"
4276,"Booked a suite w/ King and pullout sofa for 4. No matress on pullout said broken but didn't let us know that when checked in. We didn't figure this out until 10pm. Called house keeping and said yes that pullout is broke. Only 1 rollaway left to bring us and were told the other person could sleep on the floor or broken sofa.   Most alful stay in a hotel. Staff not upfront when checking in. Do not stay here.  Bathroom floor also had hair on floor, definitely maid did not clean the floor before us."
4277,"Hotel in great location for old town and cable cars providing access to Monte, Tropical And Botanical Gardens. Rooms good standard, beds very comfortable. Pools very disappointing, only 1.10m deep and very rough surface that grazed our feet and most uninviting in colour, sandy coloured, not blue. Breakfasts ok but not great. Whole experience spoiled by unhelpful Reception Staff member (female) who when asked if toilet rolls could be put in our room responded with ""you should have taken this up with housekeeper this afternoon, we don't have any at Reception"". Sorry but we were not around in the afternoon to check up on the performance of housekeepers. Similarly same Reception Staff member was very unhelpful over no show of Courtesy Bus to sister hotel.  This all said we had a…"
4279,"This hotel was great. Décor very nice. Rooms and hotel very clean as was bathroom. Location was awesome for sightseeing and short walk from airport bus and metro stop. Staff was very helpful, especially sympathetic when my bag was lost by airline and gave me lots of toiletries. Breakfast good too. Only thing to be aware of is that lobby, room and bathroom were quite small (in regular room), even by European standards. This was not an issue for me, but something to be aware of. Also, the rooms listed as singles (for one occupant) have the bathroom essentially in the room within a glass enclosure. It is done quite well, but again may not be for everyone."
4280,Staying here for Chicago Marathon. They are charging almost 400 usd per night and officially marathon hotel but they don't provide water bottles.. Its height of greediness.. Even you stay anywhere in the world in a 100 usd room at least every one provides 2/4 bottles of water.. At the check-in time guy was more interested in selling upgrades rather than briefing about hotel.. I stayed 2 weeks in USA different hotels but this is the most less customer oriented hotel.. They need money in everything even storage bags is chargeable.. Shame on hilton for providing such a third class service..
4281,"""Quirky"" doesn't quite explain my room. My room was divided by a massive yellow wall that held the bathtub, toilet & sink---- it felt like I was suing the bathroom in a shipping container. (long walk at night for a bio-break) There are no safes, basically no closet--- but the location turned out to be awesome. On a tram route near a cute little residential neighborhood with Amsterdam's original brewery. Stairs are not convenient for larger luggage--- freight elevator at the end of building is not available upon arrival-- only departure."
4282,"It has everything you expect in Ibis: correct desk service, reasonable room size, comfortable beds and a good shower. However...cleaning service could be a little bit better. And the location is more appropriate for business (close to banks and office buildings in Liberdade) than for tourism - it takes a 15 min walk to get to Rossio station and the old downtown."
4283,"Spent 3 nights. My room had just been refurbished, the carpet glue and paint smell was totally unbearable to the point of making me sick. When I asked to change room, I was told to pack, leave my luggage at reception and they would find a solution. When I came back in the evening, I was offered the exact same room.  Work started at 7.15 in the room next door. An other tip : avoid the upper floors you will be sleeping right next to cellular antennae mounted on the facade of the building. Enjoy your stay :) In the same area go to the Sofitel (more expensive) or the Knickerbocker (cheaper) you will get what you pay for."
4284,"I had an accessible room which was situated on the ground floor. Lovely king-sized bed which was so comfy I didn't want to get up. Adjustable heating with no restrictions and same with the room phone - which included oversees calls, Although we chose this hotel because it had no restaurant (quieter) the manager did allow use of the breakfast room should you wish to bring in takeaway food, read, use your laptop etc. The place was spotless and nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff. I wouldn't hesitate to go there again."
4285,"Hotel is modern   The rooms are good clean and new  The bathroom is nice not big, its a fight to close the toilet door is you a big.  The shower if fantastic good hot and a lot of water.  Airco silent   Windows are also able to open  Sun protection is very nice  Breakfast is a fight as at our time a lot of people   Were in the hotel.  Standard ok  Look out also a shop inside, and what you taker there you must pay!!  Coffee ok  Crew friendly   And you could use your Payback card!  Expensive but 👍 "
4286,"I would never come back to a hotel that has no air conditioning.   This hotel should be rated 3 star only, i understand that we should save mother earth reducing gases released by our air conditioner but PLEASE put a disclaimer upon booking! Not everyone is happy with such arrangement especially us coming from a tropical country!  We were literally sweating during midnight due to the air conditioning was centralized and controlled. I was even given a small desk fan when I complained about the temperature, then when its still bothering us, we called the reception again and they told us to open the window! We are beside the busy main road and you want me to open the damn window with every car honking!? I have my 2 y.o. baby with me and she cant sleep well due to this. Never i had…"
4287,Summarise the experience so ease of summarizing  Pros: Good looking lobby Some parts of the hotel are really old and take us back in time. House keeping does a good job  Cons: 1. A/C and exhaust and other electronics are ancient and keep making loud noise -- could not sleep 2. Really getto rooms and getto vicinity -- not worth the price  3. Very- Very mean and strict in terms of checkin and checkout time 4. Not a safe neighborhood
4288,"I was organizing a 3.5 weeks trip for a film crew. They stopped at Chicago Central Loop Hotel for 1 night. I have organized everything for them, including the payment for the rooms + tax + breakfast.  I have sent the 3rd party payment authorization form, the copy of the ID and the copy of the card (both sides).  After all this, the hotel completely ignored it and they couldn't event be bother to call me, they just made the guests pay for it.   The guests felt uneasy and uncomfortable, and I look like I did not do my job property. This is absolutely not acceptable!!! I certainly wont be booking any other crew in this hotel and tell other production managers to avoid it too.   I cannot comment on the hotel stay itself as I was not the guest. But as an organizer who booked the…"
4289,"I arrived tired and grumpy but was charmed by the courteous reception. This grand hotel needs a lick of paint. My central room overlooked the bay - wonderful- and was large and well appointed. But should I really have to crawl under the desk to plug in my computer? And is it so hard to be allowed to charge my phone near the bed? I ate in my room as I needed to work. The room service was immaculate. The Carlton salad has very generous lobster- but it was a little sad and not fresh- it had clearly been lying around for a while. BUT- I slept really well, much better than usual in a hotel, and breakfast was great. The staff are total professionals- unobtrusive but immediately attentive. So- great staff to be strongly commended; some updating needed, and really fresh lobster! Us frequent ravellers can be very picky!…"
4290,"Hotel was booked by our Travel Agent  as part of a 14 day Madeira /Portugal drive and stay vacation.We were assured that this hotel would be perfect for our 4 day stay in Madeira before flying over to Lisbon.We arrived on Sunday Oct 9th around 2.30pm,opened the hotel doors and brought in our luggage and approached the front desk.The clerk on duty was on the phone and did not acknowledge our presence but continued with his phone call.After about 5 minutes he finished with his call and finally greeted us.I just knew that this was not going to go well.He gave us our room keys and was finished with us.Never offered us any information about the area,never suggested any places to eat if we wanted to or engaged in any conversation.We went up to the room and were immediately transported…"
4291,"personal on duty - horrible - with non interest for the guests, especially the hotelboys on reception - calling a taxi was ""no their job"" as well help with the luggage. The pool on the roof - a fake. The hotel can only be recommended for one night - waiting for a flight or ...."
4292,"Booked following reading reviews on TA.  The website stated that the hotel garage could be booked at 15€ pd and reservation was needed, so we requested this through our Booking.com reservation. The hotel emailed to say this could not be booked but that it was first come, first served. When we arrived, we were told we could certainly have garage parking at 10€ pd. BUT we were not warned that this was in a very steep descent underground garage with extremely tight bends and 3 floors  below ground level. Not all drivers or cars could do this, and it took my husband some time to do so in a Ford C Max with help from two of us to park it in a space. Total garage space approx. 16 spaces over several floors. The porter said he would have advised against this if known we had such a big…"
4294,"All was clean and friendly.  Typical small rooms for Paris, but with everything you needed.  The staff was very helpful.  We had a nice leisurely breakfast.  Lots of cafes right outside the door to choose from."
4295,"As timeshare owners at the Pestana Grand Hotel ,this was our second visit to the Promenade as Hotel guests. The hotel is looking very shabby now ,we had a so called superior room ,with dirty marks on the wall paper, As yet we have never had tea making facilities in the room .The Restaurant was more like a canteen and very noisy as there is nothing the baffle the sound .Pigeons frequently walking in .The pool was so cold 22.5 degrees and I was assured by the company that this pool was heated ,as I was assured that the one in the Grand was also heated .So far this is not true .The cleaning staff are excellent and do a good job, as do  the restaurant staff ,although I don't want to kiss them every time I go down in the mornings as a greeting .A bit over the top. I am not sure I…"
4296,"I’d like to thank you for a nice stay I had with you. It was a friend who booked it and in the beginning I was a little bit skeptical.  The hotel is much prettier IRL than on the pictures. But keep in mind this is still a very basic hotel, so don’t expect to much.   We asked for a late check out and the girl in the reception (Margaret?) was very kind and helped us with that even though we had to nag a little bit about it. Thanks!  I can really recommend taking the bus or train instead of Ubers. It goes faster. Didn’t try the breakfast, but it was 15$ /pp but we decided to go out.   Cleaning is not fantastic. "
4297,"Little or no effort on behalf of staff to be helpful, mostly a take it or leave it attitude. No communal vibe at all, mostly just a few folks vegging out in front of a TV.   The showers are wretched electric ones that don't work half the time, and the showers have no privacy. Communal showers are not cool, so there was a bit of a wait in the mornings cuz folks wanted to let those showering have privacy and so effectively only one person showers at a time. The bathroom has no ventilation, so steam builds up fast and makes everything damp, including the rarely cleaned toilets.   The building facade was being worked on, so the bar area was really dark. They have the WORST brazilian beer, Sintra, and no other option. A sip of the stuff makes for a horrible hangover.   Everything…"
4298,Stayed there twice on a 2 week trip thur Brazil. A clean nice hotel but discovered bed bug bites after we checked out both my husband and I.
4300,"I have stayed at the Palace  hotel many times. The hotel has a back in the day charm yet upgraded nicely. They have a fabulous buffet and wonderful staff.  The purpose of this trip was to go to the Warriors basketball game.The Hotel is very convenient to go to the Warriors game via Bart. This stay  been a nightmare with protesters banging drums,blowing whistles and chanting on bull horns.  Guests are forced to walk through a mob of striking protesters chanting & hollering with signs to get it to the Palace. This morning at around 7 AM the crowd started chanting wake up and the room was on usable.  The first time I ever went to a luxury hotel and had to use my quiet comfort headsets to get some peace and quiet. I booked this room via the American Express Fine hotel program which…"
4301,"Excellent hotel with great attention to detail. Staff very professional and the restaurant was excellent. Would return in a heartbeat and the area has great transportation, a walkable canal and bakeries and restaurants. "
4302,"We stayed at Hotel Ekta the last week of March.  The location was fantastic - one street away from the Champs Elysee, with the Arc du Triomphe just a stroll away.  From check-in to check-out, every single staff member we came across was incredibly helpful and friendly, and never tired of my questions.  Since we travelled as family, we chose the largest room, which had a bunk bed for the kids (they loved it!), sitting area with a view of the top of the Eiffel Tower from the window.  We had a separate bedroom that even had a small balcony!    The hotel and room were very clean, with really hip/mod decor, and the breakfast was lovely.  We would definitely stay here again!"
4304,"Really disappointing that the HBO channel shows as HBO, shows as Game of Thrones on the channel guide, yet is showing Showtime. I specifically searched the hotel to make sure it had HBO before booking knowing I would be here for the premiere of Game of Thrones, been looking forward to it and now sitting in a room not able to watch it. Really disappointing."
4305,"This is a quiet hotel with only six rooms, in a quiet residential area overlooking Ribeira Brava. The rooms are modern and comfortable. The staff left little gifts for us in the room sometimes: cakes, biscuits and sparkling wine.  The only problem with the room itself was that there is no heating in the bathroom or anywhere really to hang towels: in the winter this means that towels are always a bit damp.  The breakfast was just OK, and what was available varied a bit from day to day. There was no muesli, only sugary supermarket cereal (and even that didn't get replaced once it had run out, until we specifically asked). What was described as a ""cappuccino"" was made with instant coffee. But you can at least get a proper espresso.  We tried dinner in the hotel once, but it was…"
4306,"I have been to many Sofitels, this one is bad. 1st, i still remember, this is last year, i was in the hotel lobby, I watched a poor Frenchman talking to a front desk staff, the front desk staff name was Sherry... i remember. The frenchman could not understand english very well, but his chinese was fluent. He asked Sherry over and over again, what was her chinese name? So he could understand better. Sherry refused to give him her chinese name, and the well-known and respected Frenchman even called her manager, the manager did nothing to help this man. I thought the service this man received from Sherry was pathetic, and she should have told him her chinese name immediately, instead of sitting there, and saying *no, i don't want to give it to you* Sherry did not uphold the Sofitel…"
4307,"Loved the location of hotel. Perfect if your looking to stay close to Eiffel Tower. Surrounded by restaurants, shops and people.  Had breakfast at hotel.  Nothing extravagant enough to get you started and ready to start your day in wonderful Paris.  "
4308,I stayed in this hotel more than 6 times and I like good services and team in this hotel professional enough . Good price comparing to services provided . Breakfast buffet is very rich with many items suitable for all kinds of customers .
4310,"The hotel is conveniently situated in a residential district about 10 mins walk from the Gare du Nord station and only 3-4 mins walk from the nearest metro station. While in a traditional neighborhood building, the hotel has been fully modernized inside and is very well appointed. Our stay there for a mixture of business and sightseeing  was very comfortable thanks to the good-sized room, comfortable bed, modern shower, etc. The breakfast is a typical continental breakfast buffet and is nice (although the bread rolls were much too hard one of the mornings). A stand out comment to make also is that the staff is exceptionally helpful and friendly - speaking English very well and patient with our less than adequate French."
4311,"Located in the University town and prestigious area called, Dahlem just outside downtown. Surrounded by trees and parks. I was here for a conference. They had a separate building next door for these facilities.  The room was large and with free wifi which had a fast speed. I liked it very much that you were given the codes to log in the wifi system upon check-in automatically. Breakfast was superb.. anything one could wish for. The only thing I would complain about was the AC temperature in both conference room and bedroom were not comfortable cooling enough."
4312,"Things started badly and did not improve. I arrived at 10am from a long haul trip and hoped to be able to get into a room; the receptionist told me the room was available but if I wanted it before 2pm I’d have to pay for another night. I don’t think any hotel anywhere has ever told me that they’ve got my room available but I can’t have it without paying extra. The room itself, whilst clean and very large, was quite dated and in need of a refresh; the walls and bathtub were stained, and sound insulation is poor so it is noisy despite not being on a main road. Unusually for Latin America there is a charge for wifi (R$15 per day); in theory you get 20 minutes per day free, but this did not actually work, and (judging from the login page which I couldn’t get beyond) the network is…"
4313,"After flying for 12 hours to get to Rio, hotel check-in has proved painful because staff kept transacting my Halifax Visa Debit as Credit card for ages. Over 5 members of staff did not even recognise my Bienvenue card and kept me waiting almost an hour. Having visited Brasil 9 times, 7 times to Rio alone I was very unhappy indeed. Training how to welcome Bienvenue cardholders can be good idea."
4314,"This hotel was in a quiet street directly opposite the Sorbonne University, and walking distance from the Louvre, the Musee D'Orsay, Notre Dame, the Shakespeare and Co Bookshop and, if you are a good walker (eg 1-2 hours), the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe, and Montmartre as well. There are Metro stops within five minutes' walk as well, which made Versailles very accessible. The staff were pleasant and helpful. I only had breakfast there once as I didn't get an inclusive package, but they did do a deal where they knocked off four euro. It wasn't the greatest spread I ever saw - a few small mason jars of cereal, pastries and pancakes, but I found plenty of places nearby for breakfast instead. The indoor courtyard was sometimes noisy, and the room itself very compact, but the…"
4315,"The hotel location is amazing, near by everything, in the center of shopping area and Restaurants, hotel condition is very good, room size is good, furniture and equipment is good, bathroom is very good. The only negative comments is about service and staff friendliness, but this is a common comment in all Barcelona."
4316,"This hotel was part of a Paris package deal.  We could not have been more pleased!  We stayed 6 nights. The bed was surprisingly huge and very comfortable! The bedroom was small, but bigger than what I expected it would be in Paris, so I was happy! We wanted to make the most of our six days in Paris, so we spent little time in our room. Thus, the small size worked fine. We had an inside room with a window with no view.  The room was absolutely quiet.  Even the air conditioner was quiet. I was impressed with how clean, fresh and contemporary the whole hotel was.  It was recently refurbished so there was not a scratch, knick, chip, scuff, etc. anywhere. Everything in our bedroom and bathroom was new. We felt very safe in this hotel and walking in the area at night. The hotel…"
4317,"The photos listed are not representative of what they offer. Only some of the rooms have been updated; the rest remain stuffy with shoddy construction repairs. The paint is crackled, the carpet is musty, there is conduit leading to the light fixtures and the water never gets hot!"
4318,"Stayed again in this hotel, right in the center , very convenient as you have access to 2 underground metro lines, walking access to restaurants. Hotel by itself is good efficient check in check out rooms and bathrooms are good as well. Maybe a little refresh to the entrance of the rooms would be a plus but i can do without. Nice ambiance in the lobby /bar as well."
4320,This hotel has the perfect location for exploring the city just off the Ramblas. The staff are very helpful; hotel very clean; rooms are fine with an excellent shower but overall very small; breakfast is a buffet style limited choice but adequate. Would definitely stay here again.
4321,"I was supposed to be treated as a Gold member and certain benefits may apply as a frequent flyer and visitor of different countries and cities. Hilton was one of my favorites brand, but this trip, with my family, was very bad. A simple thing as an early check in, after a 16 hours trip, to take a shower and start my activities in Buenos Aires was not possible. In addition, I end up paying almost 20% of the original rate because they change my rate because of my request of early check in!!!! unbelievable!!!"
4322,I traveled from St. Louis to Chicago to celebrate my birthday. While staying at the Hyatt at McCormick place I received a severe storm alert about snow. The Chicago area received 3 to 8 inches of snow which caused me to end my trip earlier and head home to dodge the bad weather. Upon checking out I asked for a refund of my extra day that I didn’t use and was told I couldn’t be refunded. The staff did not try to accommodate me or anything.
4323,"We got a great deal for a 3 night, 4 day stay, GBP60 b&b double per night. They gave us a quiet room at the back. Being a standard room it was compact but the only problem was getting past if someone was sitting at the desk. The bathroom was good, there was (just) enough storage space and the minibar was big enough to keep our drinks cool. Quite a big TV. The wifi worked well once you were logged in but it would make us log in again and again each day on our tablets which was annoying. The bed was comfortable and it was good being able to leave the window open and the a/c off at night (we discarded the duvets and slept under double sheets). The breakfasts were excellent - plenty of cereals, fruit, breads, cheeses and cold meats etc. There was also scrambled egg with bacon and a…"
4324,"We stayed here for a long weekend and had an awesome time! The room was very clean and of a high standard. Olivier is a great guy and a real asset to the hotel, going above and beyond to make our experience great! Breakfast is pricey, but we just went out to local pattisieres bear by. In the best location possible as well! Middle of Paris! "
4325,"I stayed here for 4 nights in August, finding it through Booking.com. Everything about it was great for me. The room was a decent size, very clean, cozy, and the AC worked great. A simple breakfast wasn't included which I hadn't remembered from my booking so that was a nice surprise. This is a couple of blocks from a Metro station and made it easy to get around. I also roamed Montemartre quite a bit and very much enjoyed everything this neighborhood had to offer. I would definitely stay here again."
4326,"After the 3-week trip over Vietnam, staying in various guesthouses, hotels and homestays, we decided to relax in a resort for the last three days in Vietnam. Based on the very good reviews we booked 2 superior rooms and 1 bungalow (third room was not available at that time) in the Cosiana Resort. Unfortunately, this turned out to be our worst decision and the worst experience during our stay in Vietnam.    After our arrival to Phu Quoc we wanted to take a taxi to Cosiana but were refused several times with explanation that it is not possible to get there by car, only with motorbikes. In the end we found one taxi driver who took us there. Well, he was apparently new in the business as he did not know how to get there. The 7 km drive on a very bad bumpy road took us about 1 hr. As…"
4327,"We had an early flight from Lisbon and travelled up on the bus from the Algarve arriving late evening. Hotel clean but lack of carpet in the room made it feel slightly cell like. Fine for one night, just across road from Sete Rios bus station but wouldn't stay longer and location too far from centre if visiting Lisbon to see the sights."
4328,"I had all the best intentions in the world to write a good review the minute I returned from my last stay in Cannes but life caught up with me and I only managed months later! Saturday past I stepped into the hotel windblown and wet following a massive storm and was welcomed like an old friend!   Why would I rave about a 2 star hotel? I can go on about the location, close to the Palais des Festival and the train station, a short walk to the beaches and near the designer shops and restaurants. Room 16 is comfortable, and I am not missing anything I would from a more expensive hotel except maybe an English TV channel for the weather - but who needs that when the temperature is a moderate 18-20 degrees - in early December!?  What has blown me away about this hotel is the innate…"
4329,"Walls are paper thin.  Could literally hear full conversations of the next room over.  Staff was little to no help, actually person I spoke to was extremely rude. Definitely a disappointment for the price, think there are better places to stay."
4330,We stayed right before NYE and the hotel was packing; most noticeable at breakfast time and checking-in/out; when there are people waiting i’d suggest concierge desks to be used for check-in since waiting for 25min for checkin is a tad long. Friendly breakfast staff and pleasant (dutch!) front desk person.  Locationwise its nice at the boardwalk though my preference would be to stay closer to old town. Value for money on the edge...pricey for what is offered. Sergi Arola’s tapas restauarant is nice.
4331,"We arrived via the hotel shuttle service (€7.50pp)which picks you up from Departure 3 door D. Just to mention there are hundreds of shuttles/taxis/buses and normal cars and it is very busy so keep your eye open for the shuttle bus. It picked up across the road. Check in was busy,a family pushed in front of us and we had to wait ages!We were early and the room wasn't ready so we stored our luggage,purchased a tram and bus 24 hour ticket,booked breakfast and walked into Amsterdam via Westerpark (this is a 15-20 min walk to Centraal). We didn't get back to the hotel until 9pm so we went straight to the room and crashed. Breakfast was a nightmare!It was manic and extremely busy.Tables were dirty,there were no plates or cutlery and it was each man for themselves!Some people do not…"
4332,"We visited the hotel for one night. The location is very good in the city with some of the best restaurents and shops within 2-10 minutes walk. A bar is on the corner at the street level, unfortunately with just a few seats. Therefor mist people leaves the place before having a drink. There is aldo a roof bar on the 6th floor. A fantastic view, and great in the sunshine. But not so nice if wind or rain. The rooms are nice. The staff are friendly and makes the stay good. A question mark about security: fire escapes (main stairs) are difficult to move fast downwards, because if tiny steps, a real threat if fire. This is the case in many old Lisboa hotels though. All in all a nice comfortable hotel. "
4333,"I have stayed at Hotel Le Florian several times and I can only praise it.    Cannes during any festival is a hectic place.   Somehow, the wonderful family who run Le Florian have created a friendly, safe and welcoming haven.   Since I started staying there, many of my friends now do as well - so during Festival Week it is lovely.    The hotel is classified as 2 Star and the price is very reasonable even during the high demand of Lions D'Or Season. The rooms and furnishings are modest but very pleasant.  The bathrooms are fine.   The hotel is spotlessly clean, and looked after by a lovely team of ladies who have worked there for many years.  Last year I stayed in one of the new Studio Rooms - it was very pleasant with a well equipped kitchen and enough working space for a desk.…"
4334,"This was an average hostel experience, typical 6 bed room, nice view, and the area is fine, but is very far from the city center. The hostel itself is good, but the location leaves a lot to be desired. "
4335,Location: 5 minute walk from the Zoologischer Garten train station.  Getting to hotel from airport: Jonas provided an immediate response to my e-mailed query about getting to the hotel. From TXL taxi cost 28 euros and took less than 30 minutes at 8pm.  Check-In: A fast and friendly check-in by Jonas. Allocated an upgraded room on a high floor as requested.  Elevators:  Small. Fast.  Room: 507.   Smelled clean. Not large but space is used very efficiently. Close to elevators. Minimalist and practical furnishings. Wood floor. Good condition.    Desk: Medium sized bench style table. Wood surface optical mouse friendly. Ceiling mounted lamp can be positioned over desk or elsewhere.   European style power plug at desk height.    Desk Chair: Not adjustable.   Comfortable for extended…
4336,We stayed here for 3 nights during Carnival and wouldn't stay here again. In any other city it would be a 3 star hotel at US$125. Yes it's on Copacabana Beach and the location is excellent but all the services are poor.
4338,"I booked this hotel based on reviews and their website. A deciding factor was the pool. Well, to access the pool as a hotel guest you have to pay extra! And then it is maybe 10 meters, so not really swimmable for exercise purposes. The hotel is located somewhere in the middle of nowhere, but has easy access to bus and metro. The rooms are clean, but basically at the standard of a glorified motel. So cups in the bathroom are 100% plastic, water is not replenished, and so on. While the pics look cool and artsy, the rooms are beyond minimalistic. If you have ever stayed at IBIS or Novotel then you know what I am talking about, this place is in the same league. Everything is self service and staff is super unfriendly.  So cannot recommend this place."
4340,"We stayed for 4 nights and the hotel was just perfect for our trip. Great location, just a few minutes walk from the train station and also to the beach front making it very convenient. The hotel was also very clean, modern and nicely decorated throughout. Our room was serviced to a very good standard everyday and the front office staff were helpful and it was pleasing that security was a priority when returning in the evening. I would highly recommend this hotel."
4341,"My wife and I arrived at the Hotel Baume just before 9pm on a Sunday evening. We were greeted by a very friendly member of staff. We were very quickly checked in and shown around the hotel. We went to our room which was very spacious and comfortable. The only downside was that the bathroom was advertised as having a walk-in shower. This was not the case, however, the over the bath shower proved excellent.   Going back down to reception we were given advice as to where to go for something to eat and drink. Each member of staff we encountered on our 4 night stay could not have been better. Each was courteous, friendly helpful and ready to answer any query we had. On our return to the room on the evening of my birthday there was a tray with birthday cake beautifully presented. Very thoughtful and much appreciated. The Hotel Baume has exceptionally comfortable beds, great linen, and functional air conditioning. In a city renowned for its small rooms our room was large with a sitting area which was well appointed with great lighting, plenty of tables etc. Breakfast in the morning was very welcome. Good scrambled eggs and bacon. The coffee was excellent and a good selection of croissants, freshly squeezed juice and pastries was available.  The Hotel Baume is a hotel I will  return to on our next trip to Paris, in fact, I would say it helped reignite our love of this, the city of light. Thank you to all the team who contributed to make our trip so enjoyable, we hope to see you soon.…"
4342,"The staff and accommodations at the Eugene are top notch. We stayed for 7 nights and we were treated as of part of the family. The staff is personable and are eager to ensure your stay is relaxing and pleasurable. A special shout out of Eduardo, the front desk manager, who is very friendly and accommodating and will assist you with whatever you need. 5 stars across the board!  part of the "
4343,"I usually try to temper my bad experiences. But this one reach some serious level of badness. Especially for an hotel claiming the 5 stars.  Their history webpage states like that:  ""At its grand opening in October 1990, the Shanghai Centre was the tallest building in Shanghai. It was also the first serviced apartment complex downtown and home to the first international supermarket providing imported goodies. Today, 20 years later, Shanghai Centre is still ""the Center of Shanghai"".  Well, you can feel the 20years. The rooms are super standard. Old fashioned. But clean. Cannot complain about that. Other good points is the internet speed, it is by far the fastest internet speed I ever experienced in China.  For the rest... Well, there was nobody to welcome you and take care of our…"
4344,"Great neighbourhood! Outside the «worst» tourist traps! Close to Sagrada and connections to subs. Grocery shop across the street and lots of good snacking during nighttime. Good beds, TV and wifi working well!"
4346,"I just returned from a 2 night stay at the Hotel de Rome and it is a very fine hotel. We purchased a room with breakfast included, and the breakfast was excellent. They made to order the hot dishes, while also having an extensive buffet.  Check In: Check in was excellent as our room wasn't ready when we arrived, but they took our luggage and placed it in our room while we were out sightseeing. They also bought us a drink (a coffee and a beer) at their bar while we were waiting. We were asked at check in if we'd like a US paper in our room, and because they offered we said yes. Unfortunately we never received that paper.  Room: The room was spacious and comfortable. The shower was a little small but had a great shower head. The bathtub was big, but it took forever to get…"
4347,"The hotel was under construction- wires were exposed from ceilings, floors were dirty.  My room was small, dirty, and on a floor where I could hear club music and a homeless person yelling in the street.  Everything about the hotel was very undesirable.  "
4348,"Everything went wrong during this short break with my teenage grand-daughter.  When we arrived at Central Station, from the airport, we were directed to the Double Tree Hilton a few yeards away.  Receptionist said we were at the wrong hotel and ordered a taxi.  This cost me 30 euros, later I found out I could have got a free ferry only a few yards from this hotel !!  On arrival at the correct hotel, I was disappointed to find out it was built between old warehouses and in a re-generation area where the work hadn't really started.  Untidy rough ground and as I walk with the aid of a stick, I was very scared each time I went out that I might fall.   After we checked in, behind a party of seven who were not helpful to the staff, we went up to a room.  The twin room which I had…"
4349,"Disappointing service even before my arrival.  With my platinum status, I reserved this hotel for 15 nights for my mom and myself.  Due to change of my work plan, I will be arriving the hotel two days later than planned, but my mom will arrival as scheduled.  Because of this arrival date difference between my mom and I, I had called US Marriott Platinum customer service ahead who then helped to leave a note to the hotel about the date difference and adding my mom’s name to the reservation to ensure she can check in and enjoy Marriott platinum service, e.g. free breakfast, free room upgrade, executive lounge access etc. (really high quality Marriott service in the US).  Surprisingly, however, when my mom arrived yesterday, the hotel told her she was not only not entitled to any…"
4350,"Awful online experience.  Have checked in to  numerous Hilton hotels on different countries with my family so we have established a great trust on their service and has hilton honors, not until our recent booking for December of this year.We booked for 2 nights stay.We were shocked when a reminder email came up and said that our stay will be for 3 nights with a $60/night higher fee! When we tried calling their customer hotline clarifying that situation,we were told that somebody called at 12:30 am ET and changed our dates! Plus we were surprised and frustrated that the customer reps just told us that there is nothing they can do,they can change dates but not the prices! So we ended up booking in another hotel where we were just few days away from our trip.Hilton have to work…"
4351,"My family and I spent two weeks last summer travelling around the Middle East and Europe. Santorini was hotel 8 of 9 of the trip, so at this point, all we wanted was some rest and relaxation. We were originally going to stay 3 nights in Mykonos, but all wanted to have one night and two full days in Santorini, so we booked one night at the Vedema Resort for an exceptional rate.  The hotel facilities are beautiful, each equipped with a hot tub, living room, fireplace, and view out into the vineyards. The beds were very comfortable, and the bathrooms were lovely. Ours had some drainage issues in the shower, and some tiles were falling off, but it wasn't too bad.  When we checked in, we told the hotel staff that we have an 8 pm flight the following day back to Athens, and if we…"
4352,"Stayed 3 nights in a superior room with view. Room was good sized with lounge, bedroom, bathroom and full kitchen. Modern decor and clean throughout. Couldn't fault anything until bed time when we climbed into our large comfy bed. Then we realised that the room was far from soundproof, you could hear the very convienent metro, and the traffic, and the happier people on the street. This was very off putting as this property has everything else going for it. So in reflection asking for a high room is a safer bet if you want a good nights sleep."
4353,"This hotel is in a great location, near the centre but on a quiet street. As we were driving the parking you could pay for under the hotel was appreciated. There aren't many spaces and this isn't guaranteed.  The only reason we gave 4 stars not 5 were that we didn't eat there as breakfast and dinner was better value at local restaurants, particularly the one at the end of the road. Also although we had booked and paid for 3 double rooms at the same price, the room for 1 person was much smaller. This wasn't acceptable to us as this visit was for a very special occasion. Although after a wasted hour the manager sorted this out it was a really upsetting start to our trip. Be warned the double rooms vary in size we thoughts one of them was a single without a price reduction. The…"
4354,"We spent 3 nights at this comfortable Left Bank hotel, and I was impressed by all staff, especially Amisa, Eve and Marie who went above and beyond to help me when I thought I had lost my passport. (Gratefully, the staff found it!) For 30 + minutes, all 3 of these ladies made phone calls, scoured the hotel, and even gave me the hotel's international phone to make calls back to the US! Extraordinarily helpful - as if I were the only guest at the hotel!   Everyone was helpful, friendly and eager to make our stay perfect. Our room was comfortable, warm and well appointed; the bar/living room was welcoming, well-stocked for coffee, cold drinks and cocktails, and the breakfasts were ample and delicious.  Though there is no dinner service, there were many Bistros, cafes and great…"
4355,"Loved Hotel Marignan, would definitely recommend for a few nights in Paris.  There is no lift so if you are on a high floor with luggage (as we were) be prepared to lug your bags up the narrow, winding stairs.  Other than that everything about this hotel was perfect.  Location - can't beat.  Price - can't beat.  Option for breakfast at a very reasonable price.  Room was clean and comfortable.  I felt safe and secure here and the staff were all very super friendly."
4357,"Don't stay here, for the price there are way better options. They treated us terribly, and I would almost consider what they did to us fraudulent activity. Bottom line if you want to have a relaxing trip without dealing with terrible service, keep looking."
4358,Just stayed 3 nights here.  A really great location slightly away from the main tourist area. The staff were all really helpful and friendly and special mention to Philip for a lovely breakfast and smile each morning.  Nothing was too much trouble for him.   Unfortunately the only thing that let it down was our incredibly small and dark bedroom. It was a birthday treat so we were disappointed and could not change as the hotel was full!  Overall a fab weekend with so much to see and do :-)
4359,"We will definitely return to Berlin and I will not shop for another hotel. Easy access to major attractions, beautiful building and facilities, nice spa, very friendly and accommodating. Highly recommended. "
4360,"Fantastic location to quickly be refreshed; dusty hotel rooms, no resort life in a dreaming environmentRestaurants with mediocre food, golf course excellent, great beach and panorama.A three stars hotel far from the five announced."
4361,"I would recommend this hotel to a young couple who likes trendy things. The hotel is virtually ""embedded"" into the building of an oldish market which is now a lively collection of tiny restaurants and stalls with gifts. From outside, you could not really tell. From inside, it looks superb. The rooms are very modern and look good - on the pictures. In reality, the rooms offer little comfort and peace. They are small, the writing table is tiny and toilet and shower are not clearly detached from the rest of the room - they both have glass doors, so you can see inside. The vanity sink is right in the room and is unpractical and shallow. I really dislike two things - the bad smell and the noise. Our room was smelling like a toilet, although everything had been really clean. We talked…"
4362,"My wife an I enjoyed our stay at your apartment. It was clean and fully equipped. The apartment is close to many restaurants and transportation, All in all, we would recommend our friends to stay at your apartment if they come to Berlin."
4363,"We had a room with a great view, the garden is beautiful, but the equipment and the cleanliness of the room is poor. We had a small kitchen without any equipment (so it was useless) and the floor of the room has never been cleaned within nine days. The breakfast was boring, everyday the same and not very good."
4364,Not a fancy outside but great rooms and close to city center and easy reach from the airport.  Close to S and U bahn brings you swift and fast around the city. Shops and restaurants close by in all kinds. 
4366,"My husband and I enjoyed this unique Hotel in an excellent location for exploring Paris. Charming decor and interesting history, combined with excellent customer service and extremely comfortable room/bed made our stay a great one. "
4367,"Last night in Riga we wanted to stay closer to airport and this hotel seemed like a great choice. Walking distance to a big shopping centre as well - perfect. Staff in the reception was friendly and good size room. There was enough space for all our bags, stroller and still space for our baby to crawl around. But the door to get in to the room was a bit narrow, at least we struggled to get stroller trough there. It's something to consider if you travel with a baby, our stroller is actually small one comparing to most strollers. We spent afternoon in the shopping centre and when we got back to the room, it was like +30 degrees in there. We had air conditioning on the whole evening, but the sun was shinning on the big windows and it didn't really get cooler... We didn't sleep well…"
4368,"Very enjoyable hotel. The stuff is extrimly nice and frendly, very Clean and breakfast is very good... We enjoy the tips we got every morning about special plece's we should go and the location perfect                      "
4369,"We stayed here in January. What a lovely hotel with very helpful staff. Elegantly decorated rooms, comfy bed and as our tv wasn't working, we got upgraded. A very classy hotel. We had tea in the lounge and the gentleman who served the tea claimed to be expert. And he was. He blended his own teas and they were lovely. One of the nicest herbal teas I've had.  The let down was breakfast. It wasn't a very comfortable experience. The head waiter was rude and very arrogant. He made breakfast a very uncomfortable experience. We felt that he was watching us the entire time and he was ready to pounce if we picked up the wrong fork.  Our phone rang and he bit our heads off. "
4370,"Pros: -Beautiful grounds. -Nice beach. -Nice pool. -Responsive housekeeping.  Cons: -Inattentive staff. -Loud wedding on Saturday night. -Far from the airport. -Windy part of the island.  We stayed at Turtle Bay at the beginning of September.  It's a beautiful hotel.  Nearly every room has an ocean view, but the best view is probably overlooking the beach so get that if you can.  There's a nice beach with ok-ish snorkeling (some coral, moderate amount of fish) and they will lend you snorkel gear for free.  The pool is nice, there's a slide for small kids and a hot tub for adults.  I believe we ended up eating at each of the restaurants on the grounds.  The food was pretty good at all of them, but you will pay the usual resort markup.  Housekeeping was very responsive when we…"
4371,"We had a 3 days escape in Berlin, the hotel is well connected by metro, just 100m away. Staff super friendly and ready to help out, about suggestions where to eat, places to visit. International breakfast and a good one. As I said, location is great, just a couple of km away from alexanderplatz by walk. I was disappointed just because of the size of the room (standard one), it was almost bigger the bathroom than the room itself. Would still suggest it to people who are not going to spend so much time in the room like us. "
4372,"This hotel offers quality, Great facilities. However the decor although clean and tidy is dated and the art work and lighting in my opinion is very suppressive .  There are good pubs and restaurants in the area and a mile down the road is the lovely old town. "
4373,"Too noisy - could literally hear everything happening on the street all night long! This was our honeymoon from Australia too, so a tad disappointing. Also please check your cupboards before you leave - leaving something behind is the hardest thing you’ll ever have to go through just to retrieve your item. They do not make it easy! Silly us! Also not many food options around."
4374,My husband and I have been staying at Concortel for almost 30 years. We have always been welcomed like family into an immaculate and well tended space in a fabulous location. We started staying for business and now it is simply our home in Paris. 
4375,"My friend and I went on a weekend to Paris from London. We found the hotel very easy, the underground and the train station are very close. The service is excellent, all very friendly, they helped us find restaurants for dinner and to plan what to see in Paris. Very nice room, clean and warm. Very happy to have gone to this hotel.  Onelia Gonzalez "
4376,"read the reviews on this site and booked the hotel as a result. the hotel is fine, based directly behind the marina, which gives a good starting point when you wish to head off to the town or to the beach.  the hotel was nice, best described as homely. the staff were nice, friendly smiles and pretty good about answering any questions. Only used the bar once, but that was more due to the fact that the hotel was empty and there was no atmosphere. my only disappointment was with regard to the breakfast. It was fine, but it never changed and there is only so much swiss cheese and ham you can eat in a week. the coffee came from a machine and was horrid. the good things about the hotel were the pool area which was nice, small but clean rooms with a rather diappointing view of the…"
4377,"We stayed here as family of 3 , we took two different rooms, one of which was superior suite and the other resident apartment, our experience surpassed what we expected, very clean rooms, staff is nice. Breakfast was amazing, room service is excellent.  Definitely I recommend it."
4378,"We stayed at the Ibis Mitte just off Alexanderplatz. Basic (by the nature of the hotel group!) but very clean, adequate supplies of linen on a daily basis, requests for more pillows granted without question or fuss and very efficiently. An ideal place to base yourselves if you are ""exploring"" Berlin. We did bed and breakfast - no problems at all with anything, the staff were lovely and all spoke really good English. If I were to be really fussy - a kettle in the room would have been great! "
4379,Just had short break to for funchal and stayed in hotel for 4 nights . Hotel is centrally located between old town and hotel / seaside districts.  Spacious lobby with good decor in communal areas but bedrooms in need of upgrade to match.  Good choice at breakfast and all hotel staff friendly.
4380,"We stayed at Casa 579 for 3 nights a couple of weeks ago. Teresa who runs the guest house is a nice lady, who was very helpful and the views from the guest house are wonderful. However, we were not fully happy with our stay. We had a double room, which worked out at around £40 a night and we had to share a bathroom with 3-4 other rooms. The problem with this was that the bathroom was pretty dirty. Hairs in the bath, scum around the sink. We were also not happy with the standard of the room. The bed sheets had holes, we were given a single sheet for a double bed and the pillow case had a big brown stain on it. You also need to know that the guest houses location is not actually in Santa Teresa, it is a good 20 minute walk away. The house runs a dance school at different times…"
4381,"The hotel was very nice and had a good location, not too far from some of the main tourist sites in Paris (pleasant 25 minute walk to Notre Dame). Small but very comfortable room and very friendly staff. Upon check-in, our room had a thoughtful gesture from the staff due to our honeymoon visit. Although no room mini bar, the hotel was very nice and had a fitness room and 24 hour lobby service with various drinks available. The express breakfast was great for a quick bite. Really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. Would definitely recommend. "
4382,Stayed 2 nights early December as a base for a Berlin visit. Hotel is very nicely situated by the river and we paid extra for a river view which was worth it. Check-in was great and the gentleman was very helpful and polite. The room was - interesting. I'm not going to be too critical as I've only stopped in Hamburg and Lubeck before in Germany so I've not got a vast knowledge of how things are done but it seemed dated - antique looking furniture and a very basic plastic kettle in the room plus a curtain for some reason between the room entrance hallway and the bed area (??). Visited the bar just after we arrived and were sitting for a good 10 minutes until we decided to go to the bar ourselves and order. If this is expected than that's fine but if so I would rather have been…
4383,Was told my upgraded room cost would be $600 total. I was VERY clear that was all I could pay. Checked my CC statement when I got home and they charged me not just $600 additional on top of the $417 I payed when I originally reserved the room. Have made 5 calls to rectify. No one has ever called me back.
4384,"We booked the Orania for a weekend away in Berlin. It’s a gorgeous hotel one of the best that we’ve stayed in, fantastic rooms, friendly attentive staff and an attention to detail that reminded me of when I stayed in the Mandarin Oriental (but you pay a bit less here!). It’s obvious that this is a special place from the moment that you arrive and the hotel manager Jennifer sits down with you in the bar with a welcome drink to go through your registration. The rooms are beautiful again fantastic attention to detail and spotlessly clean. The shower was sooooo good. Loved the touch of a nespresso machine in the room.  Atmosphere in the bar in the evening is relaxing and staff are attentive shame we didn’t get chance to hear the jazz nights. The location is far enough outside the…"
4385,"We were two adults and one child visiting Paris this spring. My son and I have visited before, but our friend was on her first visit. The hotel was picked as it was close to a Metro stop (La Republique and Oberkampf) and because the price was right. Wow, we lucked out!  The hotel is set in the middle of a small side street off Rue de la Republique. Walking in you are greeting by a friendly staff member and a huge metal basket of green apples! My son befriended the staff as he proceeded to eat apples several times a day as we used the hotel as our base over the following days.   After a speedy check-in, we entered the tiny elevator/lift up to our room. The hallway lighting has a short motion-sensitive timer but our door was quick to arrive at. Once we walked in, we were amazed at…"
4386,"We have just returned from a four night stay at the H10 Ku’damm. It was easy to find from the Zoologischer Garten station (and there is even a U-Bahn station entrance next door.) We were immediately impressed with the look and presentation of the hotel, and the staff were very helpful. The room was a good size, the bed was very comfortable, and the decor (especially the glass bathroom wall/door) was beautiful. The breakfast was great, with a really good selection of hot and cold food.   We opted to pay for a Privilege room and were not disappointed. I can definitely recommend this option -  we personally found the lounge perfect for relaxing after a day out.   As a side note, if you are planning on using the trains/U-Bahn/S-Bahn to travel about, we can recommend the Moovit app…"
4387,Had a few days with the family to see some of the sights. Hotel was fantastic big rooms and comfy beds close to the shopping. Bit of a walk to Reichstag etc but worth it. Staff in the hotel were very friendly and spoke excellent english.
4388,"Everything about this place was great! Very cosy atmosphere, beautiful colourful decoration, clean rooms, extremely nice and always helpful team and a great breakfast!  I highly recommend it to everyone who wants to spend relaxing time in Cannes"
4389,"I reserved a non-smoking room, but the room, the hallway, everything stunk. I had to get all of my clothes washed. The lobby was great, but the odor was just awful. It seems like they remodeled, but instead of replacing the walls, they just painted over the old walls that was still infused with cigarette smoke."
4391,"The Intercon has a great location right next to the Four Seasons right off the Avenida da Liberdade which has all upscale shopping. Similar to Champs Elysees in Paris. Check-in was quick and easy and Beatriz in the front desk took care of us well. We were given a tour of the hotel including the lounge, restaurants, and shown up to our room. The room was a good size with modern décor and nice bathroom.  The Lounge was nice and had great food and drinks. There was a major problem and I was insulted by the host at the door. I did not get her name, but basically she told us we don't belong in the Lounge. Despite being shown inside by the front desk staff about 15 minutes prior, she still said we should not be inside. We showed her the Gold cards as told by the front desk, and given…"
4392,I booked one room with iPhone software made by Hotel Super8. But two rooms were booked due to a bug in the Super8's software. The hotel manager was unfriendly and was not coorperative to solve the problem at all.        
4393,"This is the second year of staying at the Majestic and we find everything about the hotel as absolutely sensational. The rooms are well appointed, the staff is friendly and helpful as well as thoroughly professional.  The only problem is one beyond the control of the hotel or hotel management. During the month of August, every Sunday from 5 PM to 1 AM there is a gigantic beach party across the Croisette from the hotel. The music coming from the party is not only BAD but repetitive and pounding. The noise permeates every hotel in the area nearby and makes sleep impossible.  The City of Cannes is the only entity that can do anything to protect the comfort and quiet of hotel guests but has apparently ignored the problem.  The City needs to know that noise pollution is totally…"
4395,"We were very happy with this hotel.  Friendly staff, and very clean....we will stay here again.  It is in the heart of the high end shopping district, which made the wife happy but ended up costing me a bit more than planned!"
4396,"The rooms were very clean, the fifteenth floor wasn‘t clean every time. I think it’s a hotel for younger people and business travels. If you want to get in the city, the tram is in front of the hotel and a station for Edonkey bikes"
4397,"I booked this hotel for a short trip for my daughter's 16th birthday.  The location is in a quiet street and as 2 females we felt safe walking back to the hotel at midnight as it is really well lit and people around sitting in restaurants.   Our room was on the 3rd floor, overlooking the court yard within the hotel - a comfortable bed and the windows open very wide to allow a lovely breeze into the room.  There is air-con but we didn't need it.  The room is small but typical for Paris.  We were only in the room early morning or late evening so it was ideal.  The staff are friendly.  The Metro station Vavin is almost on the doorstep, which takes you direct to Notre Dame and we found it easy to change to other lines to the Eiffel Tower etc.  The Paris Metro is fairly easy to use -…"
4398,Stayed here for 4 nights while visiting Madeira with my wife.  Location:  Up the hill from the shopping mall.  While it looks close on a map it does get a bit annoying to walk up everyday after coming back from town.  Not an issue if you dont mind getting a taxi or renting a car.  The airport bus drops you off at the bottom of the hill so be prepared for a hike up with your luggage.  We did hear the dogs barking at night but not so bad when your balcony door is closed.    Front desk:  Very hit and miss.  Some were helpful others obstructive.  We were waiting for our tour company to pick us up and they were over 30 minutes late so we asked if the front desk wouldnt mind calling them to find out what was happening.  They insisted we go back up to our room to make the call and…
4399,"Been there for 6 night with my soon.  Location is good for shopping in the area   Close to the train station to all location including the air port  Breakfast was very good The support of the team was very good  Clean rooms, room size is good"
4400,"I recently stayed 10 days in this hotel and cannot really recommend it to business travelers. Had enormous problems with my room several times: first toilet broke down and started flooding pure dirt allover and I had to change rooms. Then, a poorly assembled closer door (heavy, with full mirror) almost fell over me (am 5 months pregnant...scary!). Minor problems like constantly broken lights and dirty towels were daily. As written here many times earlier, hotels internet (expensive!) is almost non working and causes headache to business travelers. I also was quite annoyed as in my floor (17th) there were partying young hotel guests at Sunday morning from 1Am having hall way parties with bring your own liquor bottles and ghetto blasters, and staff did not react to other guests…"
4401,"This is a 'fine' hotel, if youre interested in exploring Santorini on a scooter/ATV and dont expect too much.  Location is great, 10min walk to the Fira hub along a safe bustling road, great when your pissed. Supermarket opposite with all the normal things, fresh fruit, water, drinks, toiletries, etc  Pool is great at the end of a long day, no real pool-bar to speak of so dont expect drinks by the pool!  The best quality of the hotel is the tourist agent/transfer agent at the end of the hotel drive. Her English was great, helped us organise our scooter, arranged a volcano boat trip, showed us where best to go day/night and even taxi'd us around! Without her we wouldnt have had such a great experience!  We spent most of our time exploring on our scooter so didnt spend much time…"
4402,"Well what a find. This little hotel in monmartte was close to Lamark metro . The best kept and cleanest hotel I ever stayed in . The staff were most helpful. We booked for three nights and stayed on a fourth night and would have stayed another three but they had no availability..the breakfast was well worth the 12.50,Euro each . I would really recommend this hotel .Faultless"
4403,Hotel was undergoing major refurbishment of its foyer however this disruption did not excuse the apathetic customer service from staff on the front counter. The hotel lifts are slow and simply lack the capacity to transport the number of guests and the rooms are dated.
4405,"Usually when you book a Hotel with Expedia and the hotel is at the vip list, if you are a gold member you get some free ammenities, room upgrade or simply a welcome drink, but not with this ""vip"" expedia hotel."
4408,"The stylish interiors were great and I had the best night's sleep; the bed, pillows and linen were excellent. But. The door of the shower didn't close to the correct position, so it flooded the floor outside. (You don't expect to get in a shower and have to pay minute attention to closing the door properly, and I would guess it was only a centimetre off.) Similarly, the cold tap of the bidet leaked at the base, going onto the floor, so the very stylish bathroom was not without issues. The view from my (streetside) room was dismal, overlooking a ghastly modern building rather than pretty Bairro Alto houses, but it was quite a relief not to be overlooked by inhabited buildings as the gauze curtains and the bathroom blind didn't feel very private, and there were no shutters on the…"
4409,"Location of this place is its biggest advantage. The price is quite high, compared to other hotels I stayed at during my visit to Lisbon. Tha place is situated in an old building and the rooms are located in a sort of a basement, what makes them a bit damp and the air not the freshest."
4410,"Overall a very nice hostel with a friendly staff, who were very nice to let us store our luggage on the last day. Rooms and toilets are very clean and there is enough space for everything. Location is also very good, with a subway station just a few minutes, or you can just walk to the city center easily."
4411,"This was my first time at the Two, despite having been to Berlin so many times. My friend I went with wanted to stay at a gay hotel for some reason, and so we picked the Two. I think it was a great choice as a hotel. It's great inside: new, modern, well-equipped, and a friendly staff to boot.  For me, the area itself is not near any of the tourist things I wanted to show my friend, so it was quite a Uber trek to get anywhere. That's the only downside.  Otherwise, the rooms are great, the breakfast is wonderful, and the gym is one of the best I've ever seen in a hotel, which was important to us. Well done."
4412,This hotel was alright. The rooms were relatively clean and they did give us towels for the beach when we asked. However the staff had extremely limited English! They were really unhelpful on reception. They had a sign saying that they could help book trains but they couldn't. The most helpful thing the receptionist did was let us use their phone. Their wifi is shocking. Didn't work at all in the room during our stay and was iffy in the lobby. The shower in the room was very poorly designed and splashed everywhere as there was no curtain. This makes the bathroom really slippery and this is a hazard!! There is also an annoying blind to put down when you go to the bathroom because the doors are glass. Breakfast was Asian breakfast only so was not too our taste. Very limited for…
4413,"It was a very pleasant stay. Hotel is very clean, beds are most comfortable in the whole region. We loved friendly and quiet atmosphere. Hotel personnel, especially Emilie, was very efficient and ready to make one's stay unforgettable. Croisette is just 5-7 min away."
4414,"Had to write a review on this hotel.  Location is perfect couple blocks from Luxembourg gardens, blvd saint germain.  Several metro stops located nearby.  Hotel was spotless, service impeccable.  Antoine at the hotel is the BEST!  He’s so friendly and he helped us in booking another stay for the summer.  We stayed in the deluxe front terrace room.  The view of the Parisian street and the Odeon was like a postcard.  Plenty of cafes and restaurants within 4 mins or less walking.  Great shopping I’m the area with plenty of places for nightlife also close to Saint Michel.  The louvre is about a 20 minute walk away, musee orsay about 12 mins away.  Just want to say thanks again to the entire staff at to the hotel and to Antoine! For all of his kindness and help."
4415,"The hotel is comfortable, clean and well located, next to trams and tube, staff is cordial and attentive, breakfast was very nice, the bed was enormous and comfy; I could say only positive things about it if it wasn't for one major thing that actually is not the hotel's fault but had a massive impact on our stay - the noise of the street. And boy, that was Huge! We were in the 4th floor and even with double glazing windows (that don't help much) there were ambulance and police sirens, trams, buses, people and other street noises till 2 am and back again from 5am! I was shocked to see that this is actually legal in Germany! And why police / ambulance turn on their sirens at 1 or 2 am is beyond my understanding... Is that really necessary? And it seemed to be one after the other,…"
4416,"So when we arrived at the hotel in a day which was 35 degrees hot and came to the reception, we were completely surprised by the fact there is no air conditioning in the hotel. All they gave us were little fans which didnt help much. Besides this issue the hotel has a very good breakfast and they are very nice. The rooms are good too. Basically this hotel is very good, just mind that the rapidly changing weather can ruin your staying..."
4417,"Please read my other reviews and see that I am usually overwhelmingly positive. I usually know what I'm paying for and don't expect more.  I am also not pretending that my experience will be yours. In fact, this was the third time I tried to stay here, which was why I was particularly blown away with the absolutely outrageous service we received when we tried to check in to our hotel. Here is my story:  We booked our hotel months in advance and paid for it. Because of a convention in town, we were unable to book the entire week consecutively. We could come the Sunday but had to find somewhere else the Monday and Tuesday night, then come back to check in the Wednesday for the rest of the week. Fine. It's a great location and hotels were all booked. It would have to do.  We find…"
4418,"Dark, dingy, dilapidated dungeon. Proof that extensive renovation does not necessarily result in improvement in the guest experience. In past years, this was a really pleasant small hotel in a convenient location. No more."
4419,"This was our first stay in a Peninsula. We had debated between staying here or at the Mandarin Oriental. We very much enjoyed our stay at the Pen in Paris - it was basically as you would expect for a hotel of this stature - beautiful opulence! The beds were very comfortable, as was the rest of furniture in the room and it was nice to be able to open the windows and get some fresh air. It was a little frustrating that the thermostats would not go lower than 20C, as we found that a bit warm for sleeping.  Staff members were helpful and friendly. Our only odd interaction was with the conceirge...We asked where we could find an ATM and the ones he directed us to were all boarded up (I assume from the recent issues in Paris). I would have thought the Pen would have been a little more…"
4420,"The hotel is situated nicely within short distance to the shopping streets, but the neighborhood is a bit shaggy. The rooms are new and tidy, but the sounds from the street and upstairs can be a bit annoying.  The personnel is not too polite, and there is hard to find any flexibility."
4421,The room is comfortable and the shower is great.  For me these are the most important things; I don't need a huge room as I'm only going to sleep here.  It is very well positioned  for visiting the major tourist attractions and the staff are really helpful and very friendly.  Highly recommended for visiting Paris.
4422,This hotel is in great location and the room was fine as the 4 star hotel. We have stayed for a week and the staff is friendly and welcoming. The buffet breakfast is decent but had everything you may need in the morning. We will be back next year as usual.
4423,"A very good location. 2-3 minutes walk to the Hauptbahnhof. Very friendly staffs at front desk and retaurant. The breakfast is great,with big variety of choices. The space of the romm is quite spacious. Bathroom is equipted with leading brand accessories."
4424,"Great location, large, clean and comfortable rooms with plenty of light. 2 mins from the train station and other facilities in Paris. Courteous, friendly and helpful staff. Would recommend this for families and those who need good access to all the sight seeing in Paris."
4425,"This hotel was exactly what we were looking for - luxurious without being overpriced. Staff were welcoming from the very beginning and got us off to an excellent start. Loved the miniature balcony, chic bathroom, excellent location and very comfortable room. The only downsides were that the gym was not really enough to be classed as a gym, breakfast was extraordinarily expensive and not included and the coffee capsules were not replaced. However, these were not really an issue and didn’t affect the quality of the hotel, which was outstanding. Definitely would stay again. "
4426,"This is a busy convention related hotel and seems as if throughput more important than quality. Was disturbed late at night, sink had poor drainage which continued after reported, needed to call late one afternoon to have room made up, and while two of some items partially used shampoo take and left with none. Breakfast was included and was only adequate. Dining area nothing special  and room service food put together poorly. Staff Sid they ouldget to me bout n issue nd never did. Is located in a good area of the city. Near airport so planes landing noticed."
4427,"We had booked a room with aircon but when we arrived, we were told there was a problem & they could only offer us a fan room, giving us a part refund when we checked out. We accepted this as we had travelled for hours & just wanted some where to stay. The staff were friendly & showed us to our bungalow. The room itself was pretty dark & dated, although looked clean, but stank of damp & mould with some sort of ventilation grate in the corner of the ceiling which was taped up, which would probably allow mosquitoes in during the evening, hence the need for a net over the bed. There was a small mini bar but we were very underwhelmed for the price we had paid, but had been warned that you didn't get much for your money in phu quoc. However, there was no fan in the room & when we…"
4428,"Checked into Staybridge expecting to have as good a stay as my last time some months ago(you can find my previous positive review if you click on my other reviews).  The stay started well, got a great recommendation from the hotel to have dinner at Galetos, which is at the back of the hotel in the plaza, 2 minutes walk from the hotel reception. I dropped my bag and headed for the restaurant. Galetos serves a great ""Galetos chicken"", which is their house special. ""Deshuesado"" is the boneless, they also have a ""Classic"" option with bones. The chicken was beautifully roasted, and had a wonderful taste. My dinner companion shared that to the chicken tasted like it was ""lovingly roasted on your own BBQ stove at home.""  When I got back to my room, the drama started. I had told the…"
4429,"I checked into this hotel after a transatlantic flight in the midst of industrial action on the front doors, minimal services in the hotel and meaningless apology from remaining hotel management that ""the industrial action just happened without notice"". Other hotel staff have told me that the action has been ongoing for 3 days. Thanks for giving me no notice of this action before my arrival Westin St Francis management. I wont book again."
4430,"Very nasty hotel. There was mildew in the wallpaper, and urine on the toilet seat when we arrived. Add to that a broken bed frame and a strong cleaning products smell. The staff was very unhelpful and rude; they would not even switch us another room. Hands down the worst hotel I've ever stayed at. It was so bad we had leave the property barely a few hours after checking in."
4431,"I stay here each time I am in town. my last trip was more than a year ago. In the past the WIFI had always been excellent and type of rooms booked with credit card guaranteed is always honored. This time around, I arrived at the reception and queued at the standard desk. Both receptionists were at the platinum card holder area and occupied with guests. The lady front desk admin finishes with her guest and calls another who was not in any queue and arrived after me despite seeing me at the normal desk queuing. I had to wait for the male front desk to call me and it seems as if they only serve from that end. not to mention their phones at the reservation was ringing non stop and no one picking up. General rule of customer service is to pick up on the third ring and not a moment…"
4432,The location of the hotel is great. Walking distance to many attractions. Rooms are large enough and clean. Reception area was a bit small. There were no slippers in the room but provided immediately upon request so mo problems there. Will stay here next time im in Berlin. 
4433,"What a warm welcome! Great experience. Renovated room, beautiful bathroom and airconditioning. The location is wonderful and very close to everything. The staff gave us a really great welcome and we will definetly come back!"
4434,"Hotel looks and feels very tired. Few staff speak English. Breakfast buffet runs out unless you are one of the early eaters! Even fresh fruit was not always replenished, Beach bungalow had good ocean view and was clean.  We upgraded from a Deluxe room that was located at the back of the complex and across a stinking stream.  The smell permeates the whole resort. There is no central a/c bar meeting place, only bar is on the beach front - ok lunchtime but not when you are dressed and going out in 38degs. We cannot recommend."
4435,"Nokia vanished, Blackberry is too gonna sleep permanently, The same might not happen to Savera soon because this hotel is located in heart of city   Plus points :  - Lavish & Delightful buffet Bfast spread which is truly remarkable  - Malgudi restaurant gets a big Thumbs up  Negatives :  - Extremely poor quality of toiletries provided in the rooms which can be found only & only in two star hotels in india  - No body/bath shower gel provided in any bathrooms and when enquirer with HK staff, they politely said that we only provide soap.   Shocking that today we got hotels on equivalent status as Savera offering quite a elaborate and adequate branded toiletries but this hotel doesn't seem to notice the changing environment.  "
4437,"Not very convenient for the centre of Porto, and had little Portuguese character, which I hoped for on a leisure trip. Very busy indeed, so staff had little time to attend to our needs. Buffet meals expensive and unappetising."
4438,Small rooms for those who did not mind. Hotel and excellent staff attitude . Excellent location near the Ramblas Avenue Market . They have a small sweet surprises in the entrance ... quite nice I like
4439,Overall the Appartment was very good  Good things: + Great location at the middle of Rambla street  + spacious Appartment where there’s good space in the rooms  + good equipments   Can be improved: - Bed sheets - To add a laundry machine as families will need it  - Hard to find taxi for 5 in this crowded street 
4440,"We stayed here in December and had a great time. All the comforts of home and more. Well stocked kitchen and appliances meant it was easy to eat in - important when you have kids. Washer/dryer was just what we needed at the tail end of our trip through Spain. Quiet location in a residential neighbourhood yet near enough to Sagrada Familia and other tourist sites. Quite a few mini-marts in the area to pick up essentials. Breakfast of juice, milk and croissants was simple but good. Minor hiccup at reception because we arrived at midnight - it meant self-checkin via the touchscreen machine which was not very responsive. But a call to the emergency hotline sorted it out in no time. Would definitely stay here again or any other Eric Vokel properties."
4441,"The Hotel is brandnew and very modern. Unfortunately in this case i had Myself led by a known Hotel Chain, Ending in a Hotel in a horrible surrounding area. We felt unsafe in the near area around the Hotel and also the parking was Tricky as the nearest parking garage is about 3 minutes to walk and to get a space in there depends on luck. The answer on my review on booking was unfortunately Not really Professionell recommending i should read the room descriptions more carefully After i claimed that there is NO privacy in the room.  Definitly do Not recommend this Hotel, but rather because of the sketchy area in which it is situated."
4442,"Luckily just spend one night in this hotel, it was not possible to sleep because of the noise, generator was next to our windows and it was extremely loud! Also, we asked for a nice view, they completely ignored the request and put us in a room facing the wall. The bed wasn't comfortable. The overall interior is very poor. "
4443,"We were very happy with the choice to stay at the Les Plumes Hôtel. The whole atmosphere which came along with an excellent service and a great quality of interior designs convinced us. The hotel has a variety of nice details which made our stay complete.  See for yourself, some nights at Les Plumes Hôtel worth its salt."
4444,"It was bad, did not provide service. For example, i was a gold reward member and eligible to stay for a free night. I reserved linking my membership, but did not give me credit, and refused to review my membership."
4445,"We just got here and from the moment we pulled into the vallet it’s been horrible. We were supposed to be able to get into our room at 1pm still no room.  Manager is a jerk, if he is even a manager.  What a joke, we left at 5am since we were told we could check in early. It’s now 3pm and we have no room.  "
4446,"My mum and I decided to have a girls weekend away and found this hotel on a fantastic deal on lastminute.com . It was an easy bus ride away from the airport and we were stunned at the entrance and foyer when we arrive, very luxurious. The staff were very welcoming and friendly. I do think the rooms need some updating as they weren't as luxurious as the foyer, they aren't 5* rooms. Breakfast was included in our brilliant deal, our first morning it was a bit stressful as we couldn't find anywhere to sit and there was no staff helping but the other 2 mornings were fine. Nice choices for breakfast. The location of the hotel is great as it is quite quite but very easy access to the city centre by bus or walking distance if you like a good stroll. Overall a very nice experience."
4447,"To begin with - it takes 3 elevators from parking garage to room. Breakfast on Sundays begins at 7:30am, a bit late for early riser who want to avoid the rush of people; coffee was not even available until then. Add to to the hassle, the omelet line with one cook and a wait of 10-15 min just to move through the line for an omelet. When I get there I am told only one omelet per person - folks this is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard!!!!  If I want two omelets, by god, provide them, I am a paying customer to an expensive hotel...maybe your staff needs to read ‘Give the customer the Pickle”!  After I got the bland and tasteless omelet I had to find a place to sit in an overly crowded lobby.  The towels were dirty with stains on one of them. When I pulled out the sleeper…"
4448,"Booking.com users BEWARE. Two of us booked and checked in today only to be allocated the most sub standard rooms, either by lifts or plant that was noisy and intrusive.  They obviously regard booking.com as an inferior consumers. Message to booking.com - your business model is useless if you allow hotels like this to down grade your users to the bottom of the food chain. General message - an elitist hotel practicing poor process by just taking a single indicator as dictating your importance - PROFIT. Superficial and poor, no deeper understanding of consumer loyalty. Anyone with values - STAY AWAY!"
4449,"This hotel was a bit far from the Perfume river. Room was not very clean and room furnishing was rather old but not too bad. There were lots of mosquitoes at night when I was there.  Breakfast was ok. Staffs were friendly and helpful even they couldn't speak English well.   If there was no mosquitoes at night, I would have given this hotel an average rating.  By the way, there was a sticky rice with chicken stall on the right of the hotel (same side of the road). I have pictures uploaded here (see traveler photos). It was very good but foreigners would be overcharged as usual like every food stalls or shops in Vietnam."
4450,"Where to start, first the hotel rooms are small and are still stuck in the 80's with pink walls and a VHS player. Sleeping on the floor was more comfortable then sleeping on the pull-out couch.The air conditioning was broken half the time I stayed there and the room smelled like an ash tray. The front desk was completly unhelpful. The pool was ice cold and the hot tub was about ten degrees warmer than the pool.The hotel may be located on the beach but the only access you have to the beach is through the public beach, which is inhabited by homeless. Dont let the cheap rates fool you, when you check out they will nickle and dime you for every little thing.  They charged us $150 for 4 sets of towels and provided us with no reason for why we were being charged this. They also…"
4451,"This hotel looks great, has good service, spacious rooms, and an amazing location. It also has no television, wi-fi doesn't work, and the breakfast wasn't very good. If you go I recommend a massage, best I've ever had."
4452,"I stayed my 728, 729, and 730th night at a starwood property at this ""luxury collection"" Palace Hotel in San Francisco . The check in agent thanked me profusely for my loyalty (lifetime Platinum status) and then told me I was upgraded and checked me into a room on the 3rd floor, next to the elevator banks, sharing a wall with the service elevator, overlooking interior rooms and a cracked glass dome of the lobby. Ironically, there was a book in the room heralding the great views at Luxury Collections hotel, which was a great relief since I had the worst view I've had in a hotel room all year and at least I could look at the book to see what views I should have got as one of the most loyal and valuable customer who has spent over a quarter million dollars at starwood properties. I…"
4454,Usually it's the finer details that will make a stay a 'wow' one. I have no major complains for this hotel but there are some points for improvements.  We stayed at the hotel as a couple but was only gave a single bottle of complimentary water. Maybe this is a norm in Europe? The hotels we frequent usually give one for each guest.   There's no vanity mirror for make up. The distance between the sink and the mirror is too far and the mirror in the wardrobe is too dark. I had to stand in the bath tub to get closer to the mirror for makeup.  The toilet seat does not have the slow fall feature that you would expect. Had a rude shock at the loud noise as it slams down.  I don't believe i saw the sign to where the swimming pool is. We tried to find it but no luck. Maybe we missed it. …
4455,On arrival receptionist was rude when we asked if concierge. U have to carry ur bags . And while we were having dinner my husband got a peace of broken glass in his chocolate mousse . Yes u heard right... they handled it well . Apologized and sent a plate of fruits to the room. But they need to be more careful in their kitchen. Rooms r standard . Location ok. 
4457,"We loved this hotel...managed to get a fairly good deal.  The location was superb - the room comfortable, quiet and warm (I think we were in a room for the disabled)....the staff were friendly and helpful.  Bottom line is that if I come to Berlin again I would certainly consider coming to the Crowne Plaza"
4458,"The hotel is new so everything looks clean and nice. However, don't stay in Room 514. If you were assigned to this room, request to change it. It is right under the gym where people do heavy weighting. When they drop the dumbbell, it's a nightmare. Not to mention, if it is at early morning or late night. We accompany with a 2-year old bay and the staff just so negligent to arrange this room to us."
4459,"My partner and I recently chose this boutique hotel in Paris for a long weekend. The images shown are exactly what you get on the tin; it’s small, personable, affordable but with lovely touches throughout the hotel. Just one little touch is the lovely toiletries provided, I forgot the name but they were very nice!  We were always greeted with a smile and offered any assistance every day and this is lost when you visit larger hotels.   Across the road is a bakery where went everyday before setting off, it’s a ten minute walk to the Eiffel Tower and the handy scooters are a great way to get around Paris. We used Voi and Bird, just download the app, grip on for dear life and you’ll be buzzing round Paris in no time.   Book in advance your tickets for the Louvre, Catacombes etc as…"
4460,"My husband and I stayed here in November, 2017 for three nights prior to a cruise. Restaurants and shopping right around the corner; we had a lovely time.  The hotel was very nice and the staff was very friendly.  Our room was not what we expected.  The ""wash stand"" was just that.  There was barely enough room to keep your toothbrushes and makeup.  The shower room was of glass and not much privacy.  We did not care for the wooden slat shower floor.  It seemed  like a rather cheaply-done room.  On the second night of our stay we had no hot water.  We went to the front desk and another gentleman was there with the same problem.  The next morning we still had no hot water.  We also could hear a complete telephone conversation a person in another room was having including what was…"
4461,"With the 4-star tag and nice pictures online, we thought we were in for a treat. It's actually nothing special.   It is indeed nicely decorated throughout and they provided us with a baby bed without us having to ask for it.   However, the quality of the building/infrastructure is poor. You can hear everything (from the couple arguing next door to the guy in the room above peeing). Also all the windows show deep cracks round the frames.   An area of the open-plan bar/reception is smoker allowed, so the entire entrance of the hotel smells of cigarette (not good when you have a small baby). When we stayed over in Dec 2015, a note said that the 3rd floor, which was currently for smokers, would be smoke-free by January 2016. Does that include the bar area too? I cannot remember. …"
4462,"I was very excited to check out this property.    Obviously I knew it was pricey but that was okay, but for the price they charge I expected top notch service.  I did not receive that.  Check in was frustrating and took forever.  It was nice as they offered me a nice glass of red wine but it took over 20 minutes with 2 people in front of me.  Then when I went to check in the room types are immense.   Even if you are elite with Bonvoy expect a paper document to be pulled out on how much they will charge you for an upgrade.  A room with a fire-pit sounds great but at $400 more a bit steep.    Do you want a balcony?   Well I did and they did find one but it was not large enough for furniture.   During the night the door was soo poorly installed that my drapes moved with wind all night long.    It was so frustrating.   The manager offered to show me other rooms but it was just a waste of everyones time.  On vacation I like to upgrade to the Club Lounge when staying at a Ritz.   There is a cost to this,   Half Moon charged more than most but I thought it must be the best.   Well it wasn't.    The food was sub par.   Dessert was cold cookie (yes just one option) and a few chocolates.   The beer selection was decent.   The wine was just okay.  It was all lacking.    If you go to other Ritz Clubs I'd take a look here before you decide to purchase.  I didn't feel it was worth it.  The saving grace of the property is the setting.   The view is great.   It is set on a cliff side but if you do a little research they property has been fined in the past for restricting access to the beach.   It is a public beach so anyone can check it out.    The public space is small for the number of rooms and was nothing exciting.   Ritz Carltons have fresh flowers, they were sparse here and not really noticeable.  If this isn't bad enough expect to pay $52 for valet during the week and around $50 for a resort charge that covers pretty much nothing that one would use.  It was a major disappointment.   Overpriced hotel  in a nice setting.…"
4463,"This hotel is situated in a location that allows for convenient access to all of Barcelona's tourist attractions, the beach and port are a short walk from the hotel. It is located within walking distance of the Sagrada Familia. The amenities in the hotel are what you would expect the rooms are clean and everything works, the reception staff are very lovely and help you with any problems you have during your stay. The only problem that I had with the hotel, was the rooftop pool, it is very lovely and provides stunning views of the city, however, the bar staff seem to love to ignore you. And drinks are served with as little care and attention as possible. However, I would say that overall this hotel has: Good Amenities; Lovely staff ; A good location I would recommend this as a…"
4464,"The rooms were small, but everything you could need (except an iron) was present.  We had a great stay, made more enjoyable by the hospitality and friendliness of the staff. There are many small shops, great restaurants and things to do nearby.  The Jardins de Luxembourg are about 200 metres away."
4465,"I arrived late at this hotel after a long day of work. The woman at the front desk could not have been ruder - she was reading my reservation incorrectly and told me that only 1 out of my 3 rooms had checked in (I'm traveling with 2 colleagues who had already checked in, and my fear was that I would either accidentally be let into one of their rooms, or that we'd be charged for an extra room). She insisted over and over (extremely rudely) that only 1 had checked in, even though I knew that not to be the case. As I was going through the process of trying to cancel the room, she called up to my room to tell me she had been reading it wrong, but when I asked her if it was her mistake, she got extremely defensive. When I tried to get clarification on whether I still needed to cancel…"
4466,"It just didn't measure up for the price. The quality of the food served at the breakfast was OK but they didn't have any hot cereal, ran out of fruit and just didn't have the variety that I expect from my long history with Marriot."
4467,"First off, they really took care of us at this property. We had the Junior Suite and the room was roomy, plush and perfect for 2. It included a fantastic view of the city, so you felt like you were a true Parisian.  You are also in walking distance from of some of the most amazing Boulagerie's and cafes that one could desire. The metro is also in walking distance too and your about 20 to 30 minutes from major landmarks like The Louvre and The Eiffel Tower. The hotel staff is bilingual, super helpful, professional and really made us feel right at home. Anyone who has given this hotel a negative review should have their review privileges taken away. Nuff said. I look forward to returning soon!"
4468,"Located on the marina, away from the centre this is still a stylish hotel. Not quite in the “W” class but the service is extremely attentive and feels very genuine. Rooms are a good size, good views of the beach and go for a high floor to be above the road noise. Rooms do feel a little tired decor wise in places but the most frustrating thing is that they charge you for bottles of water in the room. Breakfast is a typical good  and extensive hotel buffet - but nothing exceptional. The lobby cafe is very expensive for food but does really good cappuccinos. A couple of smallish pools but lots of sunbeds .Great beaches on the doorstep and an endless supply of taxis right outside. Doormen really welcoming -  even handed me a towel and water ( free this time) at the entrance when I…"
4469,the room was very clean. the swimpool is small a little bit but also good. the breakfast was very delicious. in the near of a Bahn-Station and in one of the famous street in Berlin. The team is friendly. 
4470,"We were a group of 9 Americans, 3 rooms. My family of 4 stayed in the family suite. The first impression set the tone to the remainder of our stay. The entire hotel is air conditioned, which seems to be unique in Paris. The room, a family suite, was beautiful, clean and very comfortable. We were in room 102. It was facing a busy street, so there was a lot of noise at night and we heard conversations from the outside and the sound of the metro was apparent. However, we were always exhausted from the busy itinerary, it didn't disturb our sleep. Our other family stayed in room 306, off of the street and had no noise.The bathroom was also the main attraction! The toilet with a bidet was a great treat! LOL, The beds were comfortable and daily housekeeping was superb.  The breakfast…"
4472,"I love, love, love this small boutique hotel.  May 2018 marked my third stay here, this time for 10 nights.  Sabine, the owner, is a lovely, lovely lady and a wonderful hostess.  She is a former stage actress who is vivacious, warm, and eager to see her guests enjoy their time in Berlin.  She gives a level of personal attention to her beloved guests that I have encountered nowhere else, even in similar-sized establishments.  The hotel has 4 gorgeous, unique rooms located in a flat in a building that was built in the early 20th century.  The flat has been very nicely updated while preserving its historical character.  Wi-fi is excellent.  Two rooms in one hall share a hall bathroom; two rooms in another hall each have their own bathroom directly across the hall from them.  My…"
4473,The room was horrible thermostat didnt work correctly the fridge didnt work the room key worked when it wanted to they charge u twenty dollars a day for pool/wifi the bell hops did a excellant job but it was bugs in the room
4474,"Great location with elevator and air.  Loved the bathroom in 507!  Room could use a chair and the beds are a bit low but the windows open and the patisserie  around the corner offers excellent breads, sandwiches and desserts!  We walked everywhere and I don't walk anywhere.  Great staff.  Skip the breakfast as better (both price and food) is close by behind Les Halles just five minutes away but the option is great if weather is poor."
4475,"Among the hotels I've traveled to this year, Hotel PortoBay has made the bottom of the list. I've emailed the hotel way prior to my check-in advising I will need early check-in (even at a cost) plus twin beds. Upon my arrival to the hotel neither requests were met and instead I would need to upgrade the room for an additional 30 euros per night to get twin beds? and in terms of early check in, they advised the hotel is at capacity which is definitely not true because all the hotel lobbys, bar and restaurant are always empty. Bell boy took care of our begs till we came back to check in, then he told us the bags are already in the room. Great! - they he proceeds to give us a tour of the hotel/walk us up to our room? at this point we had a really long day traveling and walking…"
4477,"This location is NOT on par with other La Quinta locations by any margin. This is an old 3 story motel, looks to previously have been a Super 8 or some other similar brand, that had a coat of paint applied when converted many years ago. Upon arrival I inquired as to where the laundry was located and what the cost was as we needed to use this service. I was informed that the washing machines were out of order, but the dryers worked, and they needed to call the repair man to fix them. We completed the check in process, which through me for a loop when the receptionist stated that we would have to drive around the outside and park, as all room entries were from the exterior. I was so tired from driving 13 hours that I just wanted to shower and relax at this point and headed to my…"
4478,We read the write ups on this hotel and booked it accordingly what a mistake we had nothing but problems we are well travelled hoteliers and were totally not impressed I spoke to other hotel guests who were totally of the same opinion who also were messed around by this shamble of a hotel Although it is in a good location so are many other good hotels Yes it is gloomy The service is horrible The amenities are shocking Do yourself a favor   The place should be run by the cleaners they are more organized
4479,"We stayed here before in 2014 and when we decided to visit beautiful  Berlin again , we knew the hotel we would need to stay in the  ibis styles again . Excellent location close to Alexanderplatz , comfy beds and pillows , excellent breakfast . Friendly staff and clean modern rooms ... all at a really good price . What more could you want from a hotel in central Berlin ?"
4480,"We’ve stayed here for 3 nights. We chose this hotel because of it’s location, which was very good and easy access to trams and everything was in walking distance (rental bikes just around the corner). The checkin was very easy and staff was friendly. The room itself was quite small, as was the bathroom. But if you’re only staying for a couple of nights, I think that’s okay. At first sight, the room looked clean as well as the bathroom. I only thought the rug  wasn’t very clean and wasn’t sure if somebody had cleaned the room with a vacuum cleaner. But the sheets felt and looked clean, same for the towels.  It was quite noisy and you could hear people from the corridor which could be a little annoying.  The shower wasn’t designed very cleverly, as you always had to stop the water…"
4481,"From the start of making reservations to prepaying to the actual stay...by far worst experience....and I've been in the hospitality industry for over 20 years.  Unfortunately, the hotel does not feel safe or clean and the staffing could use some training."
4482,"I spent a three night break there as a solo travellerand was pleasantly suprised at the standard considering the very reasoable price paid. Some reviews I read mentioned Tired rooms - all the ones on the 5th floor seemed recently refurbished to a good standard . Walk-in power shower, large tv with all the uk channels, WiFi, minibar, tea and coffee available and king sized bed. reasonably sized room too. Great breakfast, friendly and helpful staff, Nice location, would return."
4483,"This is not a quality hotel. They are just able to charge the prices that they do because they're so close to the airport. The rooms are small, the beds were uncomfortable, the pillows are awful. The breakfast buffet is a joke. And at $33 a head you would expect a lot more from it. Avoid this hotel if you can and book something that's just a couple minutes from the airport where they actually have to earn your business."
4484,"Chose this hotel for specific location for being able to see friends who lived locally. Added benefits of ease of access from Tegel Airport. Small reception area with helpful staff. Bedrooms are very compact but absolutely fine if you do intend to be out all day. Beds are comfortable, bathroom a decent size with a great shower. Windows do open so fresh air if you need it inside your room!"
4485,"We were there just for one night, but it was a really nice stay. It is an old building but with many modern details.  Our room was clean, nice, big enough for 2 people. The bed was very comfy, minibar (in price included) is also a great thing. WLAN worked without problem. You can also chose from really many different channels in TV, including some movies. I can highly recommend cocktails in the bar, they were extremely delicious. We were also fascinated from the hotel cat Kiki :) she was sooo adorable, she came to us in the bar and wanted to cuddle. We met her again next morning in the breakfast room. Great idea! More hotels should have such house pets. Breakfast was not thaaat good. It was a bit messy. There were some tables in one corner, then in the other. It was a rainy day,…"
4486,"Overall this hostel was good in terms of hygiene, cost, location. The atmosphere was great! People there are very friendly. However because smoking was welcomed in the hostel whenever i had a shower the fumes would come through and i felt dirtier having a shower. Its not really a big deal, i now just look back and laugh and think that's Amsterdam for you!"
4487,"Just had a short break at this hotel the location is the best, it is a quirky hotel very trendy, very clean. The breakfast idea with benches was a concern at first but however we enjoyed it as it did make you interact with your fellow travellers more, breakfast ingredients very fresh good quality. Coffee good too as is freshly squeezed oranges for the juice. My main concern was our room on the second floor it was quite small and the shower room very small. The bed was comfy but the noise from wholesale food supplies below our room on street started working at 3-4 am very noisy trolleys on cobbled street, another it was the road sweeper and the dustbin men all very noisy. We asked move rooms but told hotel was full , so we had really broken sleep which was a shame as we loved…"
4488,"The hotel is conveniently located near the Hospital. It has a nice big indoor pool. The staff is nice and willing to help. Rooms are big and bedding is comfortable. You have to say if you you want a non smoking room as it seems one can smoke in rooms in Brazil. The bathrooms are really outdated. We stayed in 2 different rooms and both had same issues : toilet not flushing properly (i.e. you try 5 or 6 times and it is not clean yet), sinks stay full for a long time, faucets break apart, shower break apart, no single handle faucets anywhere."
4489,"I have been travelling back and forth to Berlin for business over the past few months  and I feel like coming back home when I get to the nhow.  Unique design and unique atmosphere, as usual confortable and convenient (onlz a few blocks away from my office)  The team is everything when it comes to service and willingness, all of them are amazing, special mention goes to Johannes, Richie and Pablo who are always going the extra mile to make sure my stay is simply perfect. As mentioned, feels like coming back home"
4490,"Hotel fab so clean pool area needs to be revised more beds needed poor guy at pool hated his job staff need training no one greets you it’s so necessary,rooms lovely but staff issues need to be addressed lovely guy bringing in your bags I would say he was only friendly face for a 5 star needs to be more attentive"
4491,"My wife and I are still at the resort, but figured I'd type the review while it's all fresh. Overall, it's very basic, but not awful. Don't think the beach villas are worth the $85 considering you don't even get a kettle and the mattresses are the cheapest, hardest mattresses money can buy. We like firm mattresses, but after almost no sleep the first night, we resorted to using our lounge chair cushion and asking for an extra duvet to try soften our sleep. I'm not joking....If it wasn't for the mosquitos, I would probably opt to sleep on the beach instead. On that point, last night I had to walk to reception (oh yes, also no phones in room) 3 times to ask for an extra pillow. This time was after we had gone for dinner, so I'm talking about a period of 3 hours.....I think this…"
4492,"-Booked room for honeymoon trip (driving Highway 1 from LA to SF) - was given a room with two double beds instead of one king. I was then told there was nothing else available on the night so we could not be moved. I checked online and I could still book 4 double rooms on Marriott.com - so didn't look fully booked to me.  -We asked for extra towels - never got them. -We asked housekeeping for a bathrobe/gown - was told the hotel didn't have any -We were told by a guest services person we will be given a coupon to use at the bar due to the two double beds inconvenience - the coupon never materialised -Upon arrival, the valet parking person made us park up ourselves saying 'you gotta park here if you wanna valet'. When he saw we had luggage, he then told us to drive around the…"
4493,"In the past I have stayed at Inn of Chicago and had great experiences. However, after five nights of sleeping at northwestern on chairs visiting a sick relative I came to inn of Chicago to rest. All seemed well except for a leaky shower faucet until the morning when I woke up with bites and noticed a dead bed bug on my sheets. The toilet also wouldn’t flush fully during the duration of the stay. I called the front desk to let them know and they asked me to remind them at check out.. Upon getting to check out the  young woman didn’t even make eye contact with me or apologize and told me they could only refund partial of my stay even though I’m now covered in bites and will likely have to toss my two bags and everything in them. Won’t be visiting this establishment again! Lost a…"
4494,"Would not recommend staying here based on my single, quite negative experience (as a local btw, so there are many better options for the cost).   First off, I am utterly surprised as to how this place gets decent reviews. At best this is an old rundown apartment building that has had lipstick thrown on it (lipstick on a pig, if you will). Truly, it's actually exactly what Hotel Lincoln is as it's literally a really old apartment complex turned into a hotel, but on the cheap with exception of their bar.   I actually came in and booked off of the street after finding a good deal on Hotel Tonight and inquired about the best room available which was their junior suite. We were going to a concert that evening and got the room on a whim for fun and it was anything but fun.   The room…"
4496,We had high expectations that come with the Waldorf brand. The location is great and the staff very friendly. The rooms are average and it was a bit noisy - we had 2 kids next door and could hear everything when they ran around.  
4497,"I enjoyed my stay at this hotel, the location was convenient for what I needed, an easy enough walk to attractions and sites, close to the metro and shopping. I loved the chic modern styling of the hotel and rooms, my room was lovely and comfortable, and  the bathroom felt luxurious, bright modern and clean, I couldn't have asked for more.  Every reception staff member I spoke to were very warm and friendly, they were happy to help with anything I required. Overall I had a great stay despite being sick on my trip, I felt very comfortable at this hotel"
4498,"We stayed as a party of six 60-something ladies in three twin rooms. All of our rooms were spotless and comfortable, everything worked properly and even the one on the road side was quiet when the windows were closed (no problem there is air conditioning) We felt safe due to the 24 hour reception staffy who spoke good English and were really helpful. Breakfast was lovely as were the late night cups of tea!"
4499,If you are Indian then don’t stay in this hotel. Hotel front desk  are completely trained to ignore Indians and give priority to foreigners by looking skin colour. Reason known.  While doing check out I was in no 2 and then Sanjana ( hotel front desk staff ) came and asked my go back as there is one foreigner couple is waiting on name of lady is waiting ( surprisingly she missed that I was also waiting with small kid and wife).  Once I reached checkout desk again Sagar (check out staff ) asked me go back as other foreigners is waiting ( excuse they came first ) .  I believe it was my mistake to decide LEELA MUMBAI as I have never experienced such thing. They interpret  अतिथि देवों भव: means foreigners.  I advise them to keep board Indians are not allowed. 
4500,"pros: very good location, comfy bed, safe area with very good links to centre of town. The tram and train statiion is literally just outside the hostel and there are lots of nice places to eat/shop/sightsee close by.  cons: smelly toilet, slow bar, hot room, breakfast- coco pops are fake coco pops."
4501,"My wife and I planned a Valentine's weekend in Chicago.  Given that had accumulated Marriott rewards points, we looked for a Marriott hotel at which to stay.  The website for the hotel we chose showed a beautiful dining area and a breakfast area - both important things that we look for when we go away.  Imagine our surprise when we got the to the hotel and found that it was ""under renovation"" and the dining area and breakfast area did not even exist!  Our ""continental breakfast"" each morning consisted of an Activa yogurt, a piece of fruit and an apple juice for each of us, left at our hotel door each morning in a box.  I could not believe how poor that planning and presentation were.  It will be a long time before I again stay at a Marriott hotel as a result of this.  They had…"
4502,Room was well designed.third bed request was done during our absence.this made for pleasant return from theatre.bell staff was attentive and engaged.front desk was well co-ordinated and professional.location is a great plus.
4504,"My only comment is that the breakfast space is too small when the hotel is fully booked, as it was during my stay in December. Also, the buffet space needs to be expanded to accomodate a full flow of breakfast guests. Otherwise, the room was great, service was amazing and the food delicious."
4506,"I booked this hotel for the weekend of our wedding. It was specially arranged for me through the Mercure Hotel in Edinburgh. It's a member of the Accor group, where I was employed there up until 11 days ago when I moved to the United States.   The hotel looked great! It was a perfect location to spend a couple of days in Chicago. They upgraded us from a standard king room to a luxury king room as a courtesy. We were quoted approximately $345 for 2 nights. This was all confirmed by email. We were told we could pay on arrival.   After the perfect wedding, we hired a limo to take us from Naperville to the hotel in downtown Chicago. We arrived and went to check in. After being greeted by the receptionist we were told that it would actually be over $500. An extra $125 per night was…"
4507,"A lovely one-week-stay. The Marais and the Ile de la Cité are within easy walking distance, two Métro stations close by. Our room was newly and tastefully decorated in a modern style which goes well with the beautiful architecture of the quarter. We enjoyed sitting in the lobby or in the pretty backyard patio for evening drinks after coming home from our strolls. Though the hotel is on a busy boulevard, our room was very quiet. We enjoyed the free fresh mint water, coffee and pain au chocolate in the lobby. As late risers, we did not take breakfast at the hotel, but breakfasted at one of the many nearby cafés, among which is  „Hollybelly 5“. It’s just around the corner and serves great breakfast till 4 or 5 p. m. (also gluten-free). On the whole: perfect stay, would recommend…"
4508,This hotel has a beautiful beach!  The rooms are small. Little water pressure  with very limited hot water. The bed is as hard as a rock and that is not an exaggeration. Air conditioner works great!   Service is slow and they often make mistakes with billing and ordering. Double check your tickets. It took 15 minutes for the bartender to pour a whiskey. The breakfast buffet has an inefficient set up and the cooks burn the eggs or over cook them. The sausage was undercooked and still pink. They can not keep up with the demands of the guests and they run out of items and will either not replenish them or it takes 30 minutes.   When checking out you have to wait for a maid to come in and inspect your room. I've stayed in a lot of hotels in Southeast Asia and this has never…
4509,"We arrived at 11:00 am from a flight, and understandably, the hotel did not have our room ready.  The very gracious receptionist said our room would be ready by 1 or 2 pm.  Left our luggage for storage and we went on to explore and have lunch.  When we came back at 2 pm, our room was available. We got room 807 with a balcony and a view of Barcelona.  It was a great room.  We just had a problem trying to control the thermostat, so when the room became too hot, we just opened the balcony a little bit to let the cold air come in.  Note, the tv is tuned to Spanish.  But there is an option using the TV screen remote to change the show to have audio in the original language.  So if you recognize the show to be originally recorded in English, you can change the option so you can watch…"
4510,"This is the worst hotel on the island.   The hotel is under construction and infested with rats. The website falsely advertises restaurants and outdoor swimming pool when in fact the upper levels of the hotel are currently being demolished and the swimming pool was never constructed. Our stay there was a total nightmare.  The staff tried their best with the little training they had, they are in no way qualified to run a 5 star hotel which is a reflection of the hotel owner and management.   There was constant construction noise and problems with the room which made what was supposed to be a relaxing a holiday very very frustrating and everyone we spoke to encountered the same issues. Do not book this hotel!"
4511,the room service delivered was poor and issues with the cable tv and internet access have made the overall experience not the best at all for a hotel of this kind. might give another chance in the future if they improve and control closer this sort of things.
4513,"Although Shanghai Railway station just situated next door but there are very little eateries and shoppings nearby. We have an unpleasant stay due to the cleanliness of the hotel room, I'm glad that we had booked a different hotel on our 7 days trip in Shanghai. Only stay for 2 nights and we moved to a better standard hotel after. Nevertheless, hotel management are kind enough to let us check in earlier as we arrived 10am in the morning from airport. "
4514,Good place located in area close to all famouse place  i recommend  that place you have to get there  if i will return to berlin i will be stay there again  no need to have car to see the city almost  5 min from every where 
4515,"The hotel is amazing!!! Excellent location, 3 minutes walk to the beach, restaurants and tourist attractions. The service was excellent, there were two Bulgarian ladies serving us in the morning (it's a shame I didn't ask their names) but their services were outstanding and extremely professional! In general, all staff members we have met during our 4 days stay at the hotel were very polite and helpful. I highly recommend this hotel and I would go back again! P.S I am surprised that someone could leave negative feedback for this hotel as during my stay I haven't seen anything negative. It was just perfect!"
4516,"The hotel itself is fine and the location is great, but I consider being able to get in and out of the hotel to be a basic requirement.  Management turned off the elevators for a VIP group without warning or explanation, leaving my family stranded in an elevator bank.   I stepped out of my room with a sleeping child in a stroller to grab a bottle of water from the lounge, but a staff member directed me to the wrong floor.  I returned to the elevator, only to find that it wasn’t working, and I was stuck on that floor with no food, water, phone, or access to a room. Staff didn’t know anything about the outage, and I waited twenty minutes before someone from housekeeping helped me carry my child and stroller down several flights of stairs. Then I waited longer in the lounge, not…"
4517,"Although not close to main tourist attractions, located well, close to two metro stations. Easy reachable from airport. Personnel was welcoming and helpful.  Room was big and spacious, but clearly showing age. Sound isolation is non-existent, you can hear everything from the neighbouring room and the hallway. Hotel is in a need of refurbishment. Breakfast was just average, below usual Holiday Inn standards. Roof area with bar and outdoor pool is by far biggest plus for this hotel."
4518,"I booked a large room for three adults and was given one with two double beds, two bathrooms (one with a sauna in it) - it was fantastic and perfect for three friends on a city break.  The room was very clean and well laid out.  Both double beds were comfy (even the sofa bed), the showers were good sizes with controllable water pressure to ensure a great shower.  We didn't use the in room sauna but did use the larger hotel one and the massage bed and slept amazingly.   The communal areas were all nicely decorated, very clean and tidy. Every member of staff we met were polite, friendly and helpful, happy to chat about things to do and places to eat.  I cannot recommend this hotel, or its staff, highly enough: it is well located, friendly, clean and good value."
4519,I booked this hotel last August to celebrate my 21st birthday because of the Rooftop bar! We live like 2 hours away so it's kind of a long drive. My sister and I got all ready for the bar and we were so excited we got our name on the list and everything. As I said before I just turned 21 and unfortunately I didn't receive my permanent ID like I had planned. But we went anyway. The Boucher immediately took my paper that I got from the DMV and said that it was an invalid license and couldn't  be accepted! WE WERE SO ANGRY!!! I chose this hotel for safety reasons so my sister and I didn't have to travel in the cold and for the great reviews on the bar. I even got a floor close to top so we could get their faster. But we had to go other bars completely across town because I wasn't…
4520,"My friend and I booked this hotel via the British Airways January sales. From the pictures online I wasn’t so sure about the standard of the hotel however upon arrival, I was gobsmacked at how beautiful the hotel was. The lobby is luxurious and the rooms did not disappoint either (usually hotels put more effort into their communal areas than the rooms).  We upgraded from a standard room to a balcony room. The view was not great but the weather was lovely it was nice to be able to sit outside. We had breakfast included in our package and wanted to have breakfast on the balcony but was disappointed to find that they would only offer you toast/croissants and tea/coffee. I do not think the continental breakfast was worth €29 pp because there was not much selection. I would much…"
4521,"Mystique is a beautiful property with amazing views that can't be beat.  That said, the service is terrible!  I don't know how it is part of SPG's Luxury Collection with the level of service they provide.  From the time we checked in, where we were interrupted multiple times (bellboy fighting over car keys, phone calls, etc.) we were finally shown to our room.  They had originally emailed us to ask us about our preferred turn down service, but this doesn't even matter because they turn down on their own schedule.  I had called them in advance to let them know we'd be out; however, after dinner the room had still not been turned down.  They also forgot to leave water when they made up the room and we had to call to ask for it.  We also asked for concierge to bring down something…"
4522,"The lobby was nice, staff helpful; the restaurant was filled for an event but the restaurant menu served in the bar was fine, and the bar location pleasant.  However while overall the hotel had what one would expect of a high quality hotel, it had several deficiencies that lead me to do a serious downgrade.   The fancy bathroom shower had one wall open (as part of the design) so water went on the floor.  The floor had a drain, but it was not at the lowest spot, so did not work and the bathroom floor flooded each time I used the shower.  Looking at the damage surrounding the door this is not a new problem, but it has not been fixed. The bed was far too soft.  It sank in the middle and so I had a U-shaped back and did not sleep well. And plastic flowers throughout the hotel! …"
4523,"Thought this was an excellent hotel. We stayed in two apartment type suites with a bedroom, living room with kitchenette, hall, bathroom. I think all the rooms may be like this. Very comfortable beds. The kitchenette gives a nice self-catering option. Each apartment can sleep four, with two on a sofa bed. Good value at EUR150 a night. There's a nice (albeit small) swimming pool, sauna, gym in the basement. Breakfast is good although a bit expensive. Although not right in the centre of berlin, it is very well situated, being close to U-bahn and S-bahn stations. In the end we used the bus most of the time, as there are frequent services up and down the Kurfurstendaam, which take you right into the centre of Berlin. The only reason it's four not five stars is that we asked for an…"
4524,The hotel an excellent place the stay the accommodation was very clean and well looked after. The staff were very friendly and welcoming at all time and any question we asked were answered in our own language. Anything we needed we were given. The room was ideal for our needs. Unfortunately we did not get to use any of the other facilities at the hotel due to the limited time we spent there however we did see the other facilities and had we used them it was have been excellent too 
4525,"Its tough to find a nice, modern hotel in Paris that’s also affordable. This place is a real find. It’s in a lovely quiet neighborhood but still very close to all tourist attractions with tram nearby. I will definitely stay here again next time I’m in Paris!"
4526,"These suites are really nice,however the room was only for a couple and we had wardrobes and an enormous walk in wardrobe which we thought was un necessary as the space could have been made better use of.There was a lounge area which also had your bed in,a kitchen with hob and microwave and kettle,a toaster would have been nice as we like toast in a morning but there wasn't one,Also a washer would have been better than the walk in wardrobe,small TV in lounge but was a waste of time,only English speaking channel was sky news,so TV was rubbish.We were only a short walk from checkpoint charlie,20 mins from potsdammer and 25 mins from Alexander platz all within walking distance,however we have stayed before at grand Hyatt in potsdammer platz and must admit we preferred it…"
4527,"An hotel made for tourists. It's not 5 stars hotel as many details need to be improved. Rooms are big, but the bathroom is very old. The hairdrier didn't work, there was no body lotion or hair conditioner, no toothbrush, no comb... If you want the coffee and tea making facilities you need to ask reception and after the first one, you have to pay 5€ to repeat! The TV was older than me and the controller wasn't working either. The breakfast is very simple with the typical hot dishes for tourists and low quality cured meats, as well as a big variety of fruit and bread. The gym is just a few cardio Machines and some free weights.  There are only 3 elevators and it takes a century to go up and down.  Nevertheless, the staff is very nice and it's a good hotel, but I don't reccomend it…"
4528,"Just an over priced hotel with un-clean old rooms, re-painted bathtubs and no care for clients. And an $28 fee for Wifi and ""free"" thee and coffee in the morning. What a theft on top of the over priced rooms."
4529,"Fantastic renovation clean crisp decor . Pool area great however service needs attention. Hotel attracts older people , food choice restricted in the evening however breakfast good. Great location few tweaks could make for a great hotel."
4530,"We have just returned from a week in Lagos at the Tivoli.  I won't bore you with the things that are good because everybody has already said it in their review and most of it is true.  We had an issue with a bad smell from the drains in our room.  We reported them twice and was told that it had been seen to.  However, the smell was still there.  On my third visit to reception I was told that they would see to it again but I said I would like to speak to a manger because if the problem wasn't sorted and I put a review on here the manager would reply saying that I should have asked to speak to one.  I spoke with the maintenance manager who said she too could smell the stink and said that she would get the maid to pour some strong disinfection down to shift it.  This didn't work…"
4531,"Stayed here four nights. Comfortable room. Convenient to two metro stations and right in Montmartre. Attentive and helpful staff. Terrific value. They offer an early check in option, for a modest fee, which is so appreciated after a long flight. "
4532,"We stayed at this hotel in June, 2018 -- the lobby and breakfast area were beautiful and the room was fantastic and the bed very comfortable -- the breakfast was delicious and the staff was amazing -- so friendly -- treated us like family and even shared with us the birthday cake of a staff member and prepared for us a cafe au lait!  We would highly recommend this hotel!!  It was also within walking distance to shops and cafes!"
4533,"We spent 3 nights at the Marina and although they overbooked (they said), they did upgrade us to a suite.  Our main complaint with our stay were the beds.  It was like sleeping on a board with barely any padding.  Truly.  Every bone in our body ached and although exhausted, we could not wait to get up at the first hint of daylight.  My saving grace was a swedish massage from the spa.  And I must say, it was superb!!  The young lady masseuse was lovely and gave a wonderful massage!! She was also very friendly and pleasant.  Would highly recommend the massage."
4534,The hotel is located near McDonald. It's like 20-30 minutes from Arlanda Airport. We arrived at midnight and the receptionnist was very polite. We stayed only one night there. The breakfast avalaible was convenient. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean.
4535,"Great location,and great staff.  The only negative was we checked in for one night a nd while we were gone someone entered our room.  There was no reason for anyone to enter since the room was ready and we had just checked in.  "
4536,"It's an iconic hotel that was even a scenario for a local movie. Clean, well located and...that's it.  Wifi sucks to its core. Like really terrible. Breakfast? 30 bucks for a small range of products, canned fruits (terrible!) and unfriendly staff more concerned about how to be noisier with plates and utensils being stored than serving warm coffee.  Hotel has its own ""taxis"". Stay away from it and grab a regular one unless you want to get ripped off.   Positive note to the business center and the room, which was clean and in order.  On my specific visit the hotel had some construction and noise was all out there. Excuses? Don't even think about it. It's your problem for staying at the hotel during construction time..."
4537,"This hotel had a very special style in rooms. We had a bath tub in our upgraded room and it was in the middle of the room :-). Very good location within walking distance from many cool places and the public transportation (metro). KaDeWe right around the corner.  Very good breakfast with wide selection of foods, not overly crowded. You could buy tickets to metro at the hotel. If we were to return to Berlin, we could stay here again. We think that for a short weekend break the location is very important!"
4538,"We stayed at this hotel for four nights in a comfortable room, overlooking the canal. The receptionist was efficient and welcoming, as were other staff throughout our stay.  The bedroom and bathroom were clean, as well as reasonably spacious. For those needing to keep medication at a particular temperature whilst travelling long distances, the minibar also has a freezer compartment that easily accommodates two large freezer blocks used in a medipack.  There are a few nearby restaurants, offering tasty and reasonably priced meals. Likewise, there is an underground railway station located across the road, providing easy links to historical sites around the city, as well as connections with the Berlin HBF. Having a guest washing machine and dryer in the basement is another positive…"
4539,"The hotel is amazingly nicely designed, however the rooms are a bit small and lacking proper furnitures. The wifi is simply non-existent and the service provided by bar tenders and receptionist is rather ridiculous, you can see this in hotels with lower rating. All in all, the rooms and the hotel are overpriced."
4540,"Great location with easy access to the rest of Berlin by subway. Staff were amazing and as we were part of a group had dinner and breakfast there each day. Food was fantastic, rooms were spacious and lovely, will definitely recommend!"
4541,"Whilst this hotel is perfectly located its rooms, decor and facilities date back to the seventies. Dirty carpets , wallpaper old rickety balcony sliding doors which are not really secure, old plastic balcony furniture, balconies dust and dirty not cleaned, dirty curtains drapes. This hotel need to be closed and refurbished from lobby thru to rooms, lifts,pool area.  Guest be advised that balconies sliding glass doors are really hard to lock to avoid inter room balcony theft. Whilst we did not experience any theft, we were paranoid as balconies were easily accessible by other balconies. Staff at reception were exceptional and happy to look after every need, however housekeeping was substandard. Rooms that were supposedly clean from previous guest had towels with lipstick on them…"
4542,"My husband and I have just returned from a four day trip to Paris.  We loved this hotel,  found through Trip advisor. We weren't disappointed. It is small, beautiful  and perfectly French. Set in the lovely village of Montmarte.  It is a family run hotel. The rooms were stylish and comfortable. The staff are very friendly and helpful and nothing is to much trouble ensuring your stay is perfect. The room and bathroom was spotless and housekeeping excellent.  The continental breakfast was good and in the breakfast room free tea and coffee available until 11pm.  The staff assist with booking trips, supplying maps and useful metro routes. Perfectly placed  for travelling around Paris."
4544,"This place advertised as 4 star in booking.com  Its NOT! Barely a 2 stars. A delux seaview room actually look at the roof of the next buildings with barely a glance of the sea. Old style room. The staff was good but the system is bad. Friendly but not helpful. Buffet wasnt great . I stay for 2 nights 3 days and they barely clean the room, or change the sheets, just few fold-up cover on the bed. Wasnt horrible but defintely not a 4 star. Very average and not worth the money"
4545,"this place is unbelieve we loved everything about it. location, food and the most import the employees. everyone had a smile in their faces and they are ready to help you.we will be back next year....."
4546,"Fire dept directly across street.  Trucks, sirens going all night.  Loud, noisy club district.  People yelling cars honking until 3 am.  15 degrees outside and I had to wait around while the front desk tried to find the valet to park my car (which was $62 a night).  Horrible."
4547,The Lux is just a few minutes walk from Alexanderplatz in a nice area full of shops and eateries. Very convenient for public transport. We stayed in a superior suite which was large and comfortable except for bathroom which was of a decidedly odd design. The toilet was next to the main door outside the bedroom area. The basin - actually a sink was in the bedroom area but sunk low with the tap inside so difficult to wash ones face and impossible to wash anything else eg.hair. Up a small flight of stairs another strangely designed shower/tub with several taps making it quite difficult not to get drenched in freezing cold water before figuring out the adjustments. Fine for a one or two night stay but wouldn't want to live with it! Aside from this everything else was very nice.…
4548,Top location right by the Spree and conveniently situated for the S trains (2/3 min walk). Hotel is well appointed but in fairness the room we stayed in could do with the shower re-tiling. Staff were excellent. Restaurant would be used by more guests if it was a bit cheaper. Breakfast was excellent. Would stay here again.
4549,"I can't say I was too impressed w/this property.  When first checking into apartment, many things were broken.  Light bulbs burned out, handles on faucets broken and would fall off in your hand, etc.  The apartments were spacious, and the kitchen was large.  It is a pretty safe area w/trams nearby.  Washing machine in apartment was an added perk.  Also, there aren't even numbered parking spaces for all apartment units.  Some have parking and some don't.  You have to constantly talk to the front desk person where to park your car in another slot which is a royal pain.  Weird setup.  I had made previous arrangements to make payment w/front desk on a certain day during business hours, and the person didn't even answer the phone knowing full well about our pre-planned arrangement. …"
4550,"At the first glance, the room is good. However, after we lived for 2 nights and we think it doesn't worth the price due to the following reasons  1) There are tens of ants in the room whose nest is some small holes in the wall near the window. One morning when I waked up, scarely found that tens of ants crawl happily on my pillow and on the sheet beside my pillow.  2) As it's cool in the room, we asked for two blanket (otherwise, the only thing I can use is one bed sheet, maybe two sheets). However, there is a 5cm*10cm yellow/red stain on one blanket, which looked like washed blood.   3) When we asked the owner if we can change for another blanket, the reply is very interesting. a) The stain was from the leakage of the roof that is made of straw. b) It's the only blanket in the…"
4551,"I stayed here for 3 nights and it is fair to say I had a good experience here, on arrival I was given a room straight away, once we got into the room it was quite spacious and had a small table inside and a television, the breakfast was a standard continental breakfast. The hotel is close to a few shopping places, bars and restaurants. After a certain time during the night to enter the hotel you would need to ring the buzzer which I thought was good for ser unity. Overall I had a good stay and highly rate this hotel"
4552,"Let's jump the first hurdle....this is a hotel. For a gent on business, all hotels on the face of it, look and feel the same. The differences here though are so welcome! Firstly, the staff. A genuinely helpful, happy and attentive bunch! Nothing was too much and everything was done with an efficiency any business should be proud of. Then, the breakfast! So important for me in any hotel, it can make or break everything! It was really great, a good spread with quality items and not a hectic staff member or huge queue in sight! It was actually a pleasure rather than a chore. In addition, the bar is 'special' and let's not forget comfortable and clean rooms. The area is buzzing but safe with great restaurants in easy walk of the front door. Good WiFi in the rooms. To me, this is…"
4554,"Great place to stay if you are in Berlin for some shopping. Close to Ku'Damm and U-Bahn. Quite busy at New Years, place is not quite geared to handle wifi traffic at this day or the amount of people. Yet all in all nice friendly helpful staff."
4555,"This hotel has a beautiful lobby and the design is just simply amazing, but everything else was just okay. We've been to Amsterdam a few times and definetely prefer Canal House when it comes to location, the design, and the staff. It just felt more like Amsterdam if you know what I mean, but back to this hotel... the lobby is beautiful, but also super hectic with people constantly coming in and out, a bit chaotic. The staff wasn't mean or anything, but not overly helpful with sights, orders were slow, etc. and that's probably attributed to the vast amount of people there. We also had an incident with a rat in our room in which we called them, but didn't get moved out of our room. It was completely scary/disgusting, especially since I have a major fear of rats and mice. A false…"
4556,"I have already reviewed this totally renovated hotel situated conveniently on the number 1 line of the metro system (the line that takes you to all the must-see places like the Louvre, the Champs-Elysées and the Arc de Triomphe). In a side street off of a main avenue, the rooms are very quiet, especially on the courtyard side that overlooks a school playground. The rooms are big by Parisian standards, nice queen-sized bed, big bathroom with roomy shower. The staff is courteous and helpful in every way, someone is at the front desk 24/7 so you can check-in at any time. I cannot say enough good things about it, I now stay there every time I visit Paris. Breakfast is a bit pricey but very good with lots of variety so don't pass it by just based on the cost."
4558,This was the least expensive hotel in the area and that’s why I booked it.  It’s good if you’re looking for a cheap hotel but be prepared for some complications.  The rooms are not modernized and very small. Some items in the room are broken. They do not provide room service - it’s simply door dash & you have to meet them in the lobby.  That’s not room service. I often heard other guests in other rooms and the hotel staff are loud when they are in the hallway. 
4559,A nice comfortable hotel we arrived late just after midnight an the lady said there was a charge of €40 euros I found this very amusing as we were still in the air at midnight so could do nothing about the charge was waved there are s an u barns all over Berlin so can get around easy 
4561,"We booked this hotel based on the reviews here, and we were not disappointed. Our room was newly renovated by the looks of it, and everything was in good taste. Only problem we had was the Wifi coverage in our room, everything else was perfect."
4562,"I'd give this 3 1/2 stars. Here is why...  Pros: charming lobby and bar. Location is nice. Easy to get to most places by foot. I like the vibe of the downstairs and overall feel of the hotel. Most of the staff was nice and we liked leaving the key with the front desk. Taxis had no idea where it was, but we just ended up saying ""near the post office.""  Cons: room and hallways were overly dark. Couldn't see how to get the key in the door. The stairwells were so dark I felt for sure I was going to miss a step and fall. The room was too small for two people. Did not accommodate 2 suitcases. Room was so dark, when my husband left for a meeting, he unknowingly took a piece of my undergarment attached to his briefcase! Ha! Water pressure was weak and kept going cold and hot all three…"
4563,"I felt extremely violated to have the hotel steal $250 from my account without properly notifying me, in writing or verbally, nor was an attempt made to make contact with me , or allow me to explain that situation.  I was treated rude and like a criminal when I asked about the charge, and told I would have to dispute that with my credit card company.  Upon exiting the room, I found a sealed bag beneath the bed with what seemed like marijuana substance, and placed it the trash. I was told there was damage to the room, but no extent of the damage. I was told this was a smoking charge, and that was it. I will undoubtedly not be staying at this hotel any longer and will recommend that all my colleagues and colleagues never stay at a hotel that treats very un professional and takes…"
4564,"PROS:  Very stylish hotel nestled in a central location of the city. Comfortable bed. Very friendly and attentive staff, which includes Karina :) Easy bike rental. Very helpful on getting tickets for Anne Frank House! (please book tickets online mths in advance, at the museum's website)  CONS: Rooms are so high tech, most features do not work well and can only work from remote controls, which are buggy. We had to request for our room to be tidied up by mid-afternoon two days in a row. Tried to get laundry set up but was never picked up from the room."
4565,"We began our stay being upgraded for 30/night for a ""king bed""... the bed we ended up with in our room was smaller than a queen size.  The room was dirty upon entry, a starbuck lid was on the floor from a previous guest. The drains were backed up. The windows were filthy. Paint was peeling off the walls.  When we went to lay down, the bed didnt even have a fitted sheet on it, just a king sized sheet wrapped over a mattress cover.  Hotel management was no help, and actually argued with us about the bed size, to the point we went and bought a tape measure to prove the point that it indeed was not a king sized bed.  There are tons of better hotels for the same price, in even better centralized locations. "
4566,"My wife and I stayed for just one night, but the room was just great for the price (clean, spacious, modern), and the staff could not have been nicer or more accommodating. We arrived early in the morning and leaving our luggage until check in was not an issue in the least. Additionally, the next day, we left our luggage until we left late in the day for our flight. We also felt as though the location was fantastic as it was easy to get anywhere. We walked from to Notre Dame, back to the hotel, to Montmartre in just one afternoon. Plus it is around the corner from what could be the best Boulangerie in Paris, Du Pain et des Idées. It is also about a 15 minute walk from our favorite place to grab a sandwich, Chez Alain Miam Miam!"
4567,Wonderful hotel with a professional staff and very helpful. The accomodation and the rooms are very clean and breakfast is perfect and delicious! Also they have bicycle rental service at a very good price. I will come back :)
4569,"We stayed for 4 nights after our Med Cruise.  I booked a Jr Suite and was a little dissa[ointed with the view as I was told I would have a cathedral or Gothic section view.  Well what I got was Walls and balconies of apts. with clothes hanging out to dry.  But the room was spacious, great bathroom and bed was average.  As a H10 member we got free water everyday and candies on our turndown at night.  It is located in a good location for walking and the roof top bar is amazing at night.  Servers are very good there.  But while we were there the restaurant was only open for breakfast and the menu up top was very limited.  If beer drinker only one beer served up at top.  There is a convenience store near the hotel if you go out left and walk to the nearest crosswalk and there are…"
4570,Very good hotel in the center of Barcelona. Close to a lot if things to see and visit. Close to the famous La Rambla. A lot of good restaurants. Hotel are located on a quiet pedestrian street with no traffic. There are also many shops nearby. Very recommendable.  
4571,"Annual city break to Berlin,first time in Germany and it was a good choice.Hotel very central to all the key tourist locations and public transport.Upgraded to an executive room and it had access to balcony .Breakfast had a good selection and the Apple jam was lovely.I would get the Welcome Berlin card before you go as you can activate it at the airport."
4572,"One of my favorite Marriott hotels in Germany is in Cologne, but the Berlin Marriott is easily its match.  Very friendly staff, comfortable rooms, terrific location in the city, a great restaurant and solid service.   It was a very welcoming and comfortable hotel and I felt right at home.  I very highly recommend this location is your visiting Berlin."
4573,"First of all, I am grateful that they have upgraded me to junior suite which is very spacious, thank you. But what I don't like is that I was told to wait for maybe 30 to 40 minutes but end up waiting for 2.30 hours and even that I have to keep chasing and at one point the lady at the club lounge pity me and asked me to call front desk as I have been waiting for long time. Second which is the worse is that when I booked taxi today to EZE airport, I told the bellboy/concierge/lobby guard that I would like to be dropped at domestic part of the airport, but instead he told driver to drop me at nearby domestic airport. How come Sheraton staff doesnot understand english and also don't know that we can fly domestic from EZE??? I almost missed my flight and has to forced taxi driver to…"
4574,"Overall a good place to stay. However, we rented a two-bedroom suite for four adults but received a one-bedroom suite because of Hilton operations error. The management accepted that it was their error but told us that it was our problem because ""two males adult should be able to sleep on a sofa"". "
4575,"Well, there are good / great things about this hotel.  The location, the atmosphere and the cocktail bar. Plus the views and the outside pools. The cheese burgers (by the pool) were the best my little princess had ever had.  However it was a good thing that I read reviews before going, because we were indeed put in a dreadful room on the 7th floor.  The furniture was old and filthy....not just shabby but had old stains on it that made my daughter remark that it reminded her of a murder movie.   Our ""superior"" sea view that I had purposefully upgraded to when booking to avoid the grim room, was miles away.   And our bed was SMALL.   Two calls and 30 mins later we were on the 10th floor in a much better room. Yay....  However, the food,dine around or not,  was poor. We only tried…"
4577,"This hotel is at least a 30-40 minute walk into town. Get the bus. You can buy a 24 hour ticket for the bus, tram, train for 8 euros. Well worth it when it is constantly raining! The hotel room was clean and nice bath room It would of been nice if there was a mirror and plug sockets at the desk to make it easier to dry hair There was a mirror in the corner of the room by the door which was very dark and difficult to see what you were doing Only plug socket near mirror for hair dryer was in the bathroom which meant you had to wait for the mirror to clear and all of us to have finished in the bathroom before you could use it. Fan in bathroom very poor if it was there at all Nice touch with the coffee machine, but only paper cups and machine was slow Staff at reception were polite…"
4578,"Good location is the only one reason I choose this hotel. Personally, I prefer the other three properties in Shanghai than this one. But due to the business reason, I find it really suffering that I have to stay this hotel once and once again.  No welcome drink and fruit in the room. Staff attitude was bad, esp. reception and executive lounge staff are arrogant so much that I never seen anywhere else. I guess they are local because they don't speak Chinese mandarin. Check in speed is quite fast, but I was told that the computer didn't work during check out. When I went down and check out at the reception, there is no special queue or staff for HH members even I told them I am a diamond member and my benefit should be guaranteed. During my stay, I called magic line a couple of…"
4579,"I’m well aware of the N-H brand and I must say that I was disappointed by my stay at this hotel   The positives were Very nice breakfast - from custom omelet to fruits and yogurt in the morning also good service as well   Location - the hotel is sat just on the canal and is walking distance to many places like the close by market which was really nice   The negatives : Comfort - the beds and pillows are not very comfortable  Not well coordinated - on the evening before the check-out, I’ve agreed with the reception night shift that I can check out until 1pm. On the day of check-out at 12:30 there were loud bangs on my room door (I was in the shower), when I opened the door the receptionists asks me why I didn’t check out yet ...  Weird credit card charges - I’ve pre-paid for my…"
4580,"Bom Successo was conceived and built to be wonderful. It very nearly is. A lack of investment to finish out the buildings, villas and hotel has held it back so that you now get the impression of a resort treading water while it waits for the good times - and the big money - to return.   The developers woes are our gains. The rentals are terrific value. Our one bedroom townhouse was beautiful; very spacious and finished to a very high specification.   A PGA golf course winds through the resort and it certainly looks very impressive. We didn't play so I can offer no opinion on how it plays.   Each cluster of houses/villas has a communal pool. There are no loungers or pool furniture around ours- perhaps this is deliberate. The pool wasn't very clean with drowned frogs, lizards and…"
4581,"Le Mercel is great! It’s clean, conveniently located, and the staff is great. For many Americans, the only thing that may be a bit weird is getting in and out of the hotel given we have to buzz-in. But, the staff is always there so it’s not too much of a hassle. Overall— it’s a great place to stay. "
4582,"It is very comfortable, convenient, cozy and nice place with a good vocation. There is everething you need in a hotel and more (kitchen equipped, shower, TV, refrigerator, coffee machine, dishwasher).Thanks a lot, I will recommend this place!!!"
4583,"Had a two night business trip in Berlin and stayed first time with Motel One chain. Rooms are small and modern, with comfortable double bed. Everything is kept to minimal and suited me well. Hotel has a bar/breakfast room and that's well enough for normal stays in cities like Berlin - who would eat at the hotel anyway? I Like their concept a lot."
4584,I always love staying in this hotel.  It is a wonderful and small hotel.  Everyone is super nice and the rooms are very nice.  The location is great too. Everything is perfect...What more can I say?????!
4585,"Management is extremely rude. All inclusive breakfast? You might as well pack boxes of cereal with you, because that’s all they offer. Dirty sheets/comforters are available to you on a daily basis (they never got replaced) and when we told management, she started getting defensive and yelling at me and my partner. Never again will I set foot in this place. "
4586,"The hotel is just not very nice. It claims to be a JW Marriott, but I certainly didn't see it. At first, I just thought it was dated. But as I looked around at the materials used, the condition of the hotel, size of the rooms, tiny gym and small pool, and other aspects of the hardware, I realized this is not an international 5-star hotel nor is it worthy of the JW Marriott brand. It is not a terrible hotel, but it is not a 5-star hotel. We had meetings in the hotel and the setup for the coffee breaks and lunches were about 3-star standard. The food was good, don't misunderstand. But the presentation was severely lacking. Both the food presentation and quality at breakfast left a bit to be desired. The two biggest redeeming features of the hotel are the views from the roof and…"
4587,"When we booked we paid for an upgrade from the standard room to a Studio Superior Village Room, the room to say the least was disappointing, carpet heavily marked, air conditioning hardly effective (even after bringing it to the managements attention), we cannot remember the last time we stayed in a 4 star hotel where a kettle was provided but no complimentary tea and coffee. The room safe was smaller than most hotels provide and a lock had to be hired from reception, again not normal practice in a 4 star hotel. Breakfast buffet was average with long queues for food at times, the food was far from hot, fried eggs were cooked in deep oil, is this frying? Several times the coffee station ran out of cups resulting in further queuing.  The hotel staff were all very helpful, and…"
4589,"First, we get there no WIFI. Great! Second, the gate that goes to the beach is never locked, so anybody can get in and out. In our room, there’s a leak, that keeps dripping.  We were with an other party and there was an alarm in their room that rings at 10pm and at 5am waking the other party up, the other party are elders, so they need their sleep.   We were next to the street so the most noise I have ever heard! To call the valet, good luck! they answer 1/2 times. When we were checking in, the woman checking us in was not listening to us, we asked for a no connecting doors room, guess what, we enter the room, we hear people talking very loudly, connecting doors, we go change rooms.   Since we were very displeased we our stay, we went and complained, the manager came out, told…"
4590,"Having been to Porto many times, decided to try this new hostel. An impressive but soulless adaptive reuse of an historic building in a great location. Serious money spent on what can only be called a designer hostel, but they've missed the point: key to hostelling is having fun and meeting people from around the world, neither happening here. Emblematic of the unfortunate changes overtaking Porto, big money chasing tourist cash and destroying the reason to visit. On a practical level, 4 man bunkroom entered through an 8 man bunkroom, poor design and long trek to the bathrooms. Bunk light much to bright for comfort. Bathrooms are clean and luxurious, but paper towels are out and soap dispenser jammed, need more hooks. A work in progress."
4591,"We were celebrating my daughters 21st and my 50th birthday,upon arriving for check in (which should be 2.00pm) our room was not ready yet. We were told to basicly go away and they would call us when it was ready it got to 5.30pm when my husband called them and they said it was ready (they didnt even bother to call us to let us know) When we finally checked in we were offered a late checkout. The music in the apartment next door(which the occupants were residents not hotel guests) was very loud all night so we called reception at 4.00am when they had to send security twice resulting in physical assault to hotel security and police had to be called. The hotel is suppose to have a no party policy. I feel the hotel security procedures in place are not strong enough. I have had this…"
4592,"Stayed again at this excellent little hotel - always such helpful staff, nothing is a bother. Spotlessly clean facilities, great bed and quiet surroundings for sleep! So close to everything including Latin Quarter shopping and restaurants, Notre Dame, the Seine and hop on hop off tourist buses. Good reasonably priced breakfast. Thanks Marc for another perfect stay and we will return next year."
4593,"Had a bleisure weekend following busy trade show. Spacious comfortable room with well equipped kitchenette (fridge, kettle, microwave). Room had enclosed balcony - a bit cool in March but probably very pleasant in spring/summer. Hotel in excellent location near Gendarmenmarkt (5 mins), Friedrichstrasse station (10 mins), Brandenburg Gate (15 mins). No restaurant/breakfast room in hotel but Italian restaurant next door offers breakfast for EUR11. We didn't try it as plenty of coffee shops locally but did have a late lunch pasta there - very good. Would definitely return and recommend."
4594,"We stayed there last three nights and I have to say that this hotel is blessed with exceptional people working for it. From concierge to front desk staff to spa and to private beach. Everything is beautiful and exceptional. They made our stay extremely pleasant and we can’t wait to come back. Specially Ms Amina at front reception who checked us in, it was the most pleasant check in we’ve ever experienced, thanks you very much also Maria from guest relation, Philip  at concierge, so much well informed and pro at what he does thank you very much for sorting out our bikes trip. All of you rock the place. Thank you n bless you. "
4595,"The best. First, the hospitality of the marriage owner, Manuela and Enrico. Kindness in capital letters. The second, everything else. The roomy bethroom, the cleanliness, the comfort of the bed, the bathroom, the air conditioning system (heationgin this case) and, of course, the decoration. Third, the breakfast. Varied, balanced and suitable to all tastes. Manuela offers you cooked eggs the way you prefer! Finally the location. If you want an area that is not totally central but quiet and only about 20 minutes walking from the Palace, this is your accommodation.  Improve.  Just as improvable question, without posing a problem in itself: - the thickness of the pillows that, being a very personal matter could be a little bit bigger. - I would change one of the high-backed chairs…"
4596,"It seems, HGVC started acting as Amway, most important to get you in as a member, once you are in, then, they forget about you unless they try to get you to go the next level, i.e., to pay more money. It took us more than 3 hours to check in due to wrong keys, noisy/drunk/smoking under age kids in the room next to us in our original reservation (room 6302) and then we HAD to move to another room (5302). In that room, the A/C was so noisy, every time it starts at night, my wife and I wake up because of the noise...I don't feel for the amount for points (~11K) I used for the so-called premiere location, it was NOT worth it at all...I'm seriously thinking about selling my HGVC membership..."
4597,"I'm not writing this to get a response because frankly there management is a joke anyway. This is only to be a warning to people considering this hotel. I have never had such an awful experience at a hotel, even a Marriott, which is usually mediocre at best. I traveled the world and usually stay in high end boutique hotels but gave this one a shot because a family member works at Marriott. Big mistake! Upon arrival both rooms we had booked were not available even though we booked through Marriott and not a 3rd party. Instead, we had to go across the street to the W, which is a dump! There was no apology for the overbooking and Marriott did nothing to make up for the overbooking. At the W we found a bug in the bed and when  management came up he grabbed it and flushed it down the…"
4598,"- walls are paper thin you can hear everything in the rooms next door - a/c unit is the noisiest I have heard since the 80s auto on and off ...the sound of water flushing through the unit ....no it’s not a burst pipe just the a/c trying to do its thing -the window blinds have gaps down each side which is really frustrating if you are used to a really dark room  - staff are friendly - room was clean, but lighting is an issue way to bright with no option to dim the lighting -neutrogena products in bathroom -small bar onsite -no room service available -pool is tiny -gym is ok -breakfast was pleasant but stronger plastic cutlery would be a nice touch  - As an international business traveller I asked if the shuttle could drop me 0.5 miles along the street at my works head office on…"
4599,"This is a student home, which I was aware of prior to booking. Price is not cheap, but affordable for this part of Barcelona so I tried it.  There is always a kind receptionist who speaks good English. I was pleasantly surprised when I got to my room - very clean, lots of space, nice bathroom. Towels, shampoo were available and changed daily. Even my bed was daily made. The one thing I noticed (the day was quite windy) is windows are not sealed good - I could feel and hear some breeze.  Breakfast is basic, but atmosphere is very friendly. I was a bit afraid that there would be loud student parties but place was nicely quiet, comparable to a hotel.  I stayed there 5 nights and would do it again."
4602,"Overall:  Excellent deal given the great location in Trocadero, amenities, and comfort during our stay.  Location:  I wanted to stay in the Trocadero area with at least a partial view of the tower from the room and not being too expensive, and Passy Eiffel did not disappoint.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable home base while exploring Paris.  Short walk to Eiffel Tower and other sights and close to transportation.  Ubers always available in the area.  Arrival:  The hotel is a short walk from the nearest train station.  (Side note:  if you are considering taking the train from the airport like we did, be mindful that the trains will be jam packed during AM rush hour.  This was especially stressful after a long flight and having all our luggage with…"
4603,"It was my first visit to paris. we were on our honeymoon. i would stay it was one of the best compact hotels i have ever seen. staff is very friendly and assist you with whatsoever you may need. Location is a big plus as its near gare du Nord station. Breakfast has limited options but they are worth eating. Our room was small but functional & super clean. It had all you need for a comftable stay. you dont get drinking water botel as complimentry in 4 star property was strange. however, departmental stores were near to fix this problem.  The staff guides you with all they can. one memeber even went outside to show us the correct way in courtasy. I really like to compliment the staff with their exceptionally amazing customer service.  Overall. It is worth it !  Thanks & Regards!  "
4604,"Whilst waiting in the lobby bar for a colleague, after 15 minutes still neither of the bar staff approached to ask me what I wanted. I was very surprised as there were only around 6 people sitting in the bar area at this time of day.  I eventually had to get the attention of the older gentleman and ordered a water. He didn't welcome me, smile or ask whether I wanted ice or lemon and just brought back a small bottle of water and a glass (without ice or lemon) that was heavily scratched looking many years old.  I eventually had to go to the bar to get a menu to see what drinks we would order when my colleague arrived. Once again it took a while to order a drink when my colleague arrived and once again no welcome, no smile, no snacks and the older gentlemen actually took away the…"
4605,"I was worried to be disappointed by this famous hotel and service...everything was perfect! Special mention for the concierges, always available and ready to help you, always with a solution for your needs!"
4606,"Mold in my first room , second room there was a dog barking for the majority of my time to sleep.  They gave me earplugs and said they'd discount my room but never did. Great location in Chicago but i would never stay there again. "
4607,"If you don't need to be on top of the Brandenburg Gate and you don't need a spa and a huge lobby or restaurant etc., Myer's is a lovely hotel in the great, quiet neighborhood of Prenzlauer Berg. You enter a courtyard with interesting sculptures on the way to the small lobby. Our room (""comfort"") was indeed comfortable and amazingly spacious for a big European city hotel--elegant and nicely decorated in a modernized arts-and-crafts design, not in that trendy minimalist style that's so popular. The big modern bath had both a tub and separate shower, plus 2 sinks and plenty of places to put things.  Some great restaurants in the area and you're a block away from the underground and from buses. Breakfast was included and the buffet was quite good and varied, not like that dried out…"
4608,"Central location, friendly and helpful staff, comfortable beds, very well organized room, cleanliness, good breakfast. All the four of us have been very satisfied with the accommodation, and would definitely reccommend it to others."
4609,"This hotel is unique but, they need to add lighting to bathrooms.  Have to turn on  heat lamp to be able to apply makeup.  City, county & state taxes are outrageous as is cost of room.  Absolutely no TV selections."
4610,"Well, where to begin? The location itself is a hazardous one. A latino guetho (and we are from Brazil) filled with drug addicts and homeless people all around - everyone has a suspicious look. The hotel is not so bad if you look at this neighbourhood maintaining his head above water, but all the furniture seems old, the towels and bed sheet got stains all over them - the bath tube was cracked and filthy. On the bright side, wifi and tv with dozens of channels worked fine. Staff was neutral. Kinda far from everything you want to visit at SF as a tourist. Pictures doesn't represent the whole hotel (just a few taken from renewed rooms)."
4611,The room HVAC malfunctioned.  They couldn't turn off the heat & couldn't cool down the room.   Got to 27 C - had to open the windows.   Staff was friendly but not competent to fix the problem.  Expected more from Double Tree.
4612,"Can't imagine how such a hotel could even be open. The whole thing is falling apart, bad pillows, bad towels, crappy bathroom. Food is terrible. Would never come back. No way this is a four star hotel."
4613,"Perfectly located, this new conversion is an interesting hotel, but somehow doesn't seem to be quite there yet.   The room was a bit austere. White painted walls. White linen. White polished concrete floor.   Comfortable bed and a decent shower, but no extract fan in the wc or the shower cubicle (separate). The washbasin etc was just behind a huge mirror to the bedroom.   Breakfast was fine although the terrace room wasn't very comfortable. We were the only people in the bar on the two nights we went there.   So. This place could be really good. But isn't yet. There is too much not finished. If it were one of my developments I wouldn't have accepted it.   The sister hotel just down the hill looks much nicer. "
4614,"Great place to stay temporally while settling in Berlin. I stayed 2 months while I get my paperwork done an I have no problem. The guys from reception are really nice and they are always trying to help you. The location is another important thing, it has a GREAT location.  "
4615,"We stayed here for 2 nights. Room was ok. Was given a 6th floor room which is great. On the internet it didn't say anything about a night club. We can't sleep as the boom boom noise was too much. Although it was in the CBD and easy to get to, we need a good night's sleep. The receptionist is not interested in anything not even a nice hello to greet us. None of them was friendly at all. They are not even interested in helping us. You don't need much to be nice to people.  Next time we'll stay at Airbnb where the owners can look after you. "
4616,We checked into a 7th floor two bed room in this hotel and one of the beds had no sheets or covers. They were piled on the other made up bed and the maid had just left the room half finished. When I tried to call down to the front desk the rooms telephone was broken -- and remained broken for the entirety of our multi day stay.  We installed the bedding ourselves.  The room was stuffy so I then tried to open one of the windows to let in a little fresh air but all the windows in the room are sealed up.  I used my cell phone to call down to the front desk and was told that none of the rooms in this hotel have windows which can be opened.  They said they would send up engineering to fix the phone.   We had a pressing appointment and I asked where in the room was the room safe and…
4617,"I am not sure why this hotel is only a four star, but it had everything you would need from a hotel.  The service was great from start to finish.  Only downside is parking is €28 per day which I feel should be subsidised for guests.  The location was amazing, everything was on your doorstep. The rooms were great and had everything you would need, an iron, toiletries, bathrobes, slippers etc.  I would recommend this place to stay. "
4618,"We traveled with another couple for a 4 night trip to visit Lisbon.  The hotel is a good business hotel, with a solid bar that had a good wine and cocktail selection.  They also had a big screen tv showing sports too.  Guests should definitely get drinks at the top floor bar.  The view is amazing.  The drinks are a bit more expensive than downstairs though.  The room was average but we had a decent view of Cristo Rei (you should request the rooms that look out over the river).  The room was clean and had automatic black out shades.  The bathroom was small but serviceable.  They gave a couple bottles of complimentary water, which was also nice.  The main issue with the hotel was that it was not in a great location.  There aren't a lot of good restaurants nearby and you couldn't…"
4619,I spent four nights with my daughter at the hotel.  First of all the bedroom is spacious enough . It has air conditioner and two twin beds really comfortable.  Nice view from 5th floor. The bathroom is ok too with very good hot water.  The housekeeping is quite slow. Breakfast is great ! But the waiters are not nice .
4620,"We stayed 4 nights at this hotel and were quite satisfied with the service and especially the  location. Its located right on U Bahn and Tram stations. There are plenty of restaurants and cafeterias close by. We had done a web check in and were given a room number however we arrived and due to some error, the room had been allotted to some one else. They made up for the mistake and upgraded us.   The breakfast was at best average. As feedback to the hotel staff, I'd like to suggest that if the Breakfast timings are upto 10 AM, it doesnt mean that you guys start winding up at 9:40 with half of the options gone by 9:45.   Except for this one thing, we found the service to be very satisfactory."
4621,"The hotel i normally booked in Paris was fully booked so a colleague pointed me to this one. Have to say i was wrong so far: as per now i will book this hotel when in Paris for business. Great area, great rooms and great food."
4622,"So I had gone there for work and my work area was 1.5 miles away from the hotel, so it was convenient work wise as well as was convenient to lot of restaurants/cafes/bars too. Closer to even train station and getting to and from this hotel was very easy. So as soon as i entered my room, I see a strand of hair on my WC. I immediately complain and they don't get here until 30mins and when they do, they assure me of getting it sorted before I come back in the evening post work and unfortunately I see more stands of hair on my WC. This time I requested them to send the most senior person of the hotel/alongwith housekeeping and they oblige and cleaned it but it was a horrific stay although the housekeeping senior manager was good and complemented me with a few Goodies. Please make…"
4623,"- our car was broken into & our stuff stolen on their guarded lot. Unbelievable. They even said it happens all the time and that 1 guard didn't show - that's why they failed. Well that's no comfort.  - they hardly seemed to care. We had to start cleaning the car out before they realized they should help. They did comp us the parking fee, a room service fee and the Internet fee. But for the hassle & error on their part, they should have comped our room.  - the people who were supposed to follow up the next day didn't  - also, their internet service sucked. Their support couldn't figure out how to make a Chromecast stick work. "
4626,"I have traveled all over the world, and over the years have stayed anywhere from a a 2 star to a 5 star.  Never have I ever experienced such rude staff with terrible attitude. Pros: The check in process was quick and smooth Cons: When I checked out, there was a charge that I wasn't aware of.  I talked to the front desk and she repeatedly asked me if I was sure I didn't charge it.  As if I did and was lying about it.  Then when she finally agreed to take the charge off, she couldn't provide a receipt, claiming system was down.  She took my email address to send to me later, and days later I still didn't receive it.  So I called the hotel # and talked to this woman Teresa to request the emailed receipt.  I cannot remember the last time I spoke to someone this rude, especially in…"
4628,"Conveniently located just off the Kurfuerstandamm, around 200 m from the Ku'Damm U-Bahn station, this is a fairly standard, comfortable, well-equipped chain hotel, servicing the business traveller and - it seemed - coach parties. Rooms are clean and serviceable (although slightly shabby, a refurb is going to be needed very soon) and well-serviced (although I was surprised to find used chewing gum deposited on the wall)."
4629,"Excellent hotel,be advised that the aquarium in under refurbishment so covered but will be stunning when back in operation. Well placed to give access to radio tower and nice walk to other tourist sites "
4630,Great location that has you within walking distance of the sites. Very friendly and helpful check-in and checkout that some hotels seem to have forgotten about. Very nice barman in the checkpoint bar. A little cold at night but we still managed good nights sleep
4631,"At 10 min walk from the metro in a quiet street, this address charms with its themed interior of vintage furniture and soul and jazz.   The rooms are sizeable enough (this is Paris after all). We enjoyed our complimentary espresso on our tiny terrace with its quaint purple table and chairs. We loved the designer taps in the bathroom and the bluetooth enabled sound system in the room.   The breakfast is all one could wish for, with fresh fruits, salmon, cheese, scrambled eggs, pastries and cereals.   And every single staff member went out of their way to make us feel comfortable and at home. Highly recommended.   We will be back. "
4632,"This hotel is under construction, it is a mess the elevator wasn't working all walls/surfaces are covered in tarps and plywood.  AND THEY ARE CHARING NORMAL RATES   If you stay here get ready to be woken up at 7am each day with loud hammering and work going on right outside your room."
4633,"Golden Tulip Paulista; an adequate hotel.  Pros - Location  Cons - Noise (fridge, surrounding rooms, incoming aircraft) - Furniture cleanliness (sofa, desk chairs) - Bathroom size - Lack of iron / ironing board  Having read other reviews of the Golden Tulip Paulista, I was expecting a bad hotel experience. But fortunately I found a hotel that was... adequate. Not great - really not even good - but adequate. The hotel is clean-ish but somewhat run down - it looks like an 80s hotel that hasn't been through a lot of renovation since its opening. Not really bad, but not quite good either; adequate.  The room (10th floor) was quite small with the bare minimum furnishing; a bed, a sofa, a desk, a TV table and a few small bed side tables. It had a small kitchenette-type area behind a…"
4634,"This is a great hotel in a good location. Located a few blocks from La Croisette, and great restaurants right around the corner, makes this boutique hotel the place to stay. There is a large supermarket just about a block and a half away, that has everything. The colorful outdoor courtyard, were you can have a wonderful glass of wine after your busy day, and a great breakfast in the morning, just makes this place even more special. We have been to Europe a lot, and I must say this is the best service we have received in a boutique hotel. Keep up the good work!"
4635,"We stayed in Paris for three nights and ended up at three different places! I wish we found this one earlier. Fantastic stay! Central ac, clean and super friendly staff! I see why it was busy. Looking forward to coming back and staying again in the future. "
4636,I stayed at the Sheraton for one night for business.  The hotel is rather run down.  I was upgraded to a room which I was told was excellent.  It was indeed spacious but the decoration was really not my taste. The pool looks nice but the gym is small and poorly equipped.  I have been an SPG platinum member for quite a few years and this is the very first time that I was refused a late check out in my room.  I had to rush back to my room and pack so that I could move things to a regular room (decoration similar to previous and small...).  I understand that late check outs are not guaranteed but I should have been warned when I checked in. Not my best experience...
4637,"The hotel is basic but fine. Clean and well maintained. Their administration leaves a lot of scope for improvement, I stayed for 3 nights, 100% prepaid. In arrival we were advised of a $25/night charge basically for internet. My total bill $87 USD but these guys won't stop charging my card and have now processed about $745 USD of charges. Watch out, they were very casual in their communications to me re the charges and really don't seem to care about resolving this. "
4638,"Stayed here during a conference, which I believe there are many of in this hotel. It has a corporate feel and is very comfortable.The rooms are super and quite large with nice decor. Staff are friendly and helpful but sometimes a bit too in your face as they are everywhere in the reception area and always asking if they can help. The breakfast is the most expensive I have ever had... 43 euros per person! This is too high regardless of the food itself. The range at similar hotels around the world is between 25-35 euros and the staff seemed surprised that people commented to the cost of the breakfast. The gym is dated and needs updating. Would I stay here again probably yes but then I would make sure I had breakfast included !  "
4639,I really enjoyed having the supermarket in the same building and the rooms were really clean Also the breakfast has everything you need And last but not least the fitness centre was complete and spacious
4640,"Stayed here (room 915) for 1 night on Saturday 14th July with my husband and 2 children.   I shall start with the positives first - the hotel was well positioned right in the heart of the city, very close to the shops and the red line (Grand).  The in-house restaurant served nice food at breakfast time, although the service was a little slow. Check-in/out was easy and concierge were very helpful in storing our bags and arranging transport.  The negative and sadly it's a deal breaker - the noise at night is incredibly loud!  Music from nearby bars, noise from party goers, sirens going off every few minutes but the worst is the sound of revving engines from adapted cars/bikes all night long. It is hard to describe how loud they were because I have never experienced anything like…"
4641,"Dear, lifelong friends and I stayed at the Eden Roc planning for a relaxing get away together.  We had a wonderful time in Miami but the staff at the Eden Roc worked hard to make our trip a negative experience.  (NOTE: Housekeeping was the one bright spot.)  Here are a few examples of the poor experience.. 1. the toilet in a fellow guest's room was not working and staff informed them that they did not have have on staff to fix it - despite telling them they did 3 hours perviously.  2.They offer you credits but make it almost impossible to use them.  3. Fight you when you show them mistakes on the bill.   4.. The reception desk was severely understaffed.    5.  There are 2 hotels on property - Nobu and Eden Roc.  We asked 4+ people what the difference was and no one could tell us."
4642,"Near by the Nation tube stop, there is this wonderfull, charming hotel where you can find nice rooms which are quiet at night. very friendly personal and some great restaurants in the neighbourhood. An absolute great choice."
4643,"The hotel reception and restaurant staff all speak good English and everyone is so polite, friendly and professional.  The hotel is clean, quiet and very comfortable, which serves a fantastic self-service continental breakfast and evening meals.  Rooms have TV, coat hangers, towels and shower/hair wash.  Don't forget your continental electrical adaptor to charge your electronic appliances.   The hotel is ideally situated within a 10 minute walk from Potsdamer Platz, where you will be able to catch public transport anywhere in Berlin.  The Alhalter Strasse U-Ban station is situated at the end of the street.    I would recommend anyone visiting Berlin, who is wishing to sight-see or enjoy the city centre to consider booking into this hotel.  I had an enjoyable stay and will…"
4646,"I stayed in Hilton Chicago for several days. The entrance is promising but then unfortunately it’s one of the few good things this location has to offer. The room is nothing special, I didn’t even receive shower gel and shampoo (they remember them only at the third day). Not even a bottle of water, no minibar. View from the room was horrible, the lights in the room poor. The fitness Center has modern equipment even if the provided towel are way too small. Breakfast overexpensive. The cleaning personnel was quite rude. They don’t hold the luggage after your stay and redirected (eventually, after several wrong indications) to another corner in the building where you have to pay cash for that (and of course no receipt).  The position is central, 10 mins by taxi to most of the clubs…"
4647,"Had the King suite on 2nd floor.  Entire room smelled like a greasy spoon kitchen, probably because it's situated above fast food restaurants.  Overlooked the dumpster of said restaurants, even saw a rat running out of the dumpster.  Our entire wardrobe/suitcases/and ourselves smelled like the greasy oil. Not what a ""luxury"" hotel should be.  Maybe other floors are better, but we will not be back to try again."
4648,"It's certainly my worst experience for the last 10 years, while staying very frequently in hotels all over the planet!!! The hotel is old and needs to be completely renovated. Rooms are so noisy that I didn't manage to sleep without ear plugs. Wifi is a disaster: this is very expensive for a low speed with a difficult access in the room and the free access is also difficult to connect in the lobby. Breakfastis more than average. This hotel would desserve less than 3 stars in the European or Asian standarts."
4649,"I have a 2 day stay at this hotel, to attend a wedding. We had requested a king bed room. My husband has a bad sore throat, so we wanted to change to 2 doubles. It took me half hour to get someone who could find my reservation. Then I was informed there is a $20 charge to change beds. I did not even inquire if it is daily or for our 2 day stay. I have NEVER heard of this before. We have a negative attitude, even before entering the hotel. Anyway, I know I will enjoy the wedding, regardless."
4650,"Fantastic location so close to Everything . Easy to find they offer complimentary parking ,trams stop out side.  Staff very helpful. Special diet including Gluten free (sun Gluten) products available at breakfast. It is an older Hotel and more on the budget side needing a bit of attention .  I really liked that it still had the ambience of Lisbon old town. The views of the old town are great. Rooms clean ,bed and pillows OK  Our Shower needed maintenance very difficult ? & don’t rely on the hair dryers lady’s ? There is a minibar but no tea or coffee facilities in the room no problem taking it to room from downstairs but I missed not having a hot capper. We loved Lisbon."
4651,"The check in was a mess. We were a group of 67 and there were no bell boys available. We had to cart our own luggage to our rooms. The room was warm. Air-conditioning was not working. No one could speak English. when we finally got to someone who spoke English they told us airconditioning would not be turned on and to open the door or window ( it was October). Even with the windows open the room was still warm and we could not sleep the 2 nights in spite of comfortable beds. We checked in a 2 PM. Lunch (which was pre-ordered) was not ready. When it came there was not enough. We ended up with 5 people ordering a la carte and paying for it, in spite of the prepaid lunch order for the group. It was impossible to get anything. We wanted some fruit through room service  at 9 pm…"
4652,"Located in a great spot overlooking the Bund, this hotel is showing its age, and doesn't compare favorably with other more modern properties around Puxi and Pudong. I wasn't crazy about the clothes closet being in the bathroom in my suite, and having to lug a suitcase past the shower and hot tub to get there. Old and outdated electrical outlets, had to unplug their existing appliances to charge my phones and iPad. Air con blowing right into your face as you sleep, never finding a comfortable position in a large bed. Overall, a very average experience, despite a nice exec lounge and welcome macaroons, those were unfortunately, the only highlights. Lastly, the checkin clerk at the Platinum desk was the unfriendliness personified, should've got the message and gone elsewhere at…"
4654,"Good hotel, but with some failures.  Is not a bad hotel para it should be much better for a 4 stars hotel.  For me, it should be a 3 stars hotel. The location is very good, but the staff should be more professional to solve some problems"
4655,"Stayed for the night after failing to get a suite at Crown Towers where we normally stay. Booked into a Corner Room 1580 at Promenade as that was all that was available due to conference. Nice views but very dated room. Bathroom needs a serious makeover and TV can surely be updated from the old standard def 42 inch Plasma you bought back 10 years ago. Bed mattress was one of those old mattresses you can buy at A-Mart. Very  uncomfortable with pillows to suit. Very disappointed. Hotel Room would be a 3.5 to 4 star at best if your easy to please.  Mini Bar was small but well stock. Plenty of choices. Look, for the price you pay, there are much much better hotel rooms in Melbourne.   Thankfully the night on the gaming floor was a success.  Having stayed at all 3 - Towers, Metropol…"
4656,"The hotel is really clean and quiet. The staff is nice, helpful and speak a prefect English. For the breakfast the buffet is good and fresh. Specially love the fresh fruits. Only thing that could have been better the pillows. But hell for a couple of night they still can do the trick. "
4657,"Me and my friend checked into this hotel for 6 nights, we got a free upgrade to a superior room.  The room was nice and the beds were comfortable, the bathroom was especially nice with a deep bath and a good shower. The location was good for Casa Batllo and Casa Mila but it was a 10-15 minute walk to Las Ramblas and Placa Catalanya.  Room Service and Reception were very nice and helpful - overall it was a good experience. The only thing I think was missing was that there was no tea making facilities, they had a espresso machine and we had complimentary capsules, but I like to drink tea and that was not available."
4659,"This was my 6th time staying at Hotel Baume and it is an absolute treat each time. The staff is beyond helpful and the room is always great. Love the neighborhood too! Quiet, charming, close to great restaurants, and perfect distance for a nice run in Luxembourg Gardens.  Highly recommend!"
4660,"Handed a glass of Cava at check-in which was a lovely touch.  The rooms are big and comfortable with plenty of space for a short break.  The roof bar has fantastic 360 degree views over Barcelona and the prices were reasonable.  ALL staff were friendly and helpful.  Only downside was the lack of balcony, or opening window.  We had to call down to reception to get the door to the small ledge opened so we could have some fresh air in the room.  We never ate in the hotel as we thought 14 Euros was very expensive when we eat a very light breakfast.  It did however all look good.  Just outside the main entrance on the Right corner is a lovely, reasonably priced Tapas restaurant.  Lots of places for breakfast on C de l'Hospital, out the hotel second right turn."
4662,"I recently stayed at this hotel with family for two nights. Upon arrival, we left the car in the valet parking which was fine. It was rather expensive, however, we accepted that because of location and paid for it. You can take the car out as many times as you like 24 hours a day which is a nice touch. Mobile check-in facilities for this hotel on Marriott's was a nice touch, it made checking in easier and a similar experience to what we have recently had at Hilton and other brands. Something to check out if you are looking to stay with Marriott.  The room we booked was a family room with two queen beds and had a patio connected onto it. We we excited about having a patio and paid extra to have this functionality as the trip to Miami was to celebrate an important birthday. We…"
4663,"Oh my god I wanted to shoot myself! The service was terrible and the hotel was not what I expected. I arrived at the hotel relaxed and within 5 minutes was stressed out and wishing I'd booked anywhere else! The stressed out feeling kept coming back throughout our stay. It was not the relaxing beach holiday I signed up for!   When we arrived I was surprised to find out that you have to cross the busy road to get to the swimming pool and beach - it's not within the hotel. This was something that was not apparent to me from the photos or website - but it may have been my error for not looking too closely, but be warned!  The swimming pool is very small and because the beach is not a private beach there are no loungers or umbrellas set up on the beach. The lobby is like a canteen -…"
4664,"Just a basic hotel good for a place to stay if you are going to spend more time out sightseeing. Lovely bar staff and great service. I would suggest if you are after a good night, go out of the hotel, it's not so much the entertainment but other quest seem dull and hardly cracked a smile. "
4665,"When booking this room the reservation person was most helpful.  She suggested a less expensive option to stay in the section of the Hotel that hasn't been renovated, that the room was lovely and I wouldn't be disappointed, wrong.  The room was old, worn out and on the parking lot.  Too, it was right near their kitchen and smelled of whatever they were preparing.  There was supposed to be a Keurig coffee maker in the room, as it turned out only in the renovated rooms, it just continued.  Etc.  Very poor air-conditioning in our room."
4666,"Stayed here while attending a conference. In a good location. Had a nice room but without any nice view (actually I don't know if they have rooms with nice views). The service was great always with friendly staff ! Liked the breakfast buffet options. However, felt the room rates are bit too expensive."
4667,"This was the last Hotel we stayed at as part of a tour of South America, having stayed at 3 other Hotels in different places.  This was the poorest Hotel of all. The Staff, especially on Reception, were great and helpful but the rooms were tired, unclean and smelt of something we would not like to hazard a guess at.  They were bad enough for us and some friends to request a change of rooms which was granted, after some discussion.  The new rooms were marginally better!!  The original & New rooms were called Superior Rooms so we are extremely grateful we were not placed in a basic room!!!!   This Hotel was part of a package arranged by Citrus Travel and our advice is ask them to change it as it is a bit of a 'downer' after such a lovely tour"
4669,The hotel has a strange entrance off the main shopping street  The rooms are very small with an even smaller bathroom The breakfast was decent and the breakfast staff were very nice The hotel is in a good location
4670,"Stayed one night and the hotel was ok.  The rooms are nice, but the building is not very isolated regarding traffic noise or noise from the restaurant/breakfast preparations. Our room was on the 12th floor, so we heard the breakfast quite well. Location is great. Staff was polite.  However, the staff sells other services such as boat cruises and transportation. These are not up to standard for what you pay for. Would not recommend to book any services through them."
4672,"Ok to be fair, i would never stay in Paris in the neighbourhood of Gare du Nord. Now that i stayed at the 25hours, you have to give it a go, for business reasons or if you have to get in early to Gare du Nord. Old Mercure was not great. This is refreshing, clean (except corridors carpets on 4th floor), rooms are cool (a bit too dark, don t know if lights bulbs are broken/out in room 426, or if I could not find the switches ;-)), staff is engaging, theme is Africa and eastern Mediterranean, ... and there is Neni, the restaurant, after the one in Berlin and Amsterdam, it s good to see the same quality ingredients, fresh products, taste and cool design. Very tasteful and very good breakfast. So as a conclusion, if you don t intend to get out of the hotel, it s definitely worth it,…"
4673,"Good location but similar to others found mouldy smelly bathroom, room service replenished towels etc first night but not second night. We stayed for 3 nights in total.  Standard is low for Accor chain."
4674,The location was excellent but the room was very disappointing! I had booked a superior room as it was for my husband's birthday. It felt like a cell. No window and very dark. I thought the staff were lovely but could not recommend or return to the hotel for this reason.
4676,"We had 4 nights at the Savoy Saccharum having a very relaxing time. It was lovely to be in such a beautiful and relaxing place that really helped us to unwind. The hotel itself is very luxurious with good amenities. However, as others have said it is very dark and poorly lit. As the mother of someone who is visually impaired (who wasn’t with us on this trip) I am aware that anyone with any sight impairment would find it very difficult to stay here. Indeed we shared a lift with someone who was obviously struggling. Even I found the main staircase from the reception area very difficult because of the poor lighting. Whilst not much can be done about the lack of natural light in some areas, better electric lighting could make a big difference.  Our room was very well equipped, very…"
4677,As non-residents we always enjoy an evening visit to the special ambience of the bar and a little dancing on the wonderful dance floor. This time it was the special Friday night Jazz Evening ... excellent musicians ... and the added attraction of the web-advertised Happy Hour on the first Friday of the month .... only to be spoiled when we got the bill at the end of the evening to be told that as we had ordered the first drink 7 minutes before Happy Hour commenced their was no reduction on any of our bar bill! Amazing as we did in fact  order our first drinks 23 minutes AFTER the Happy Hour started ... the bar staff clearly did not know what was advertised and were uncompromising and it left a nasty taste in our mouths ... Such a pity as this place is a very special place to…
4678,This was our last hotel on our European Tour. We found the hotel clean and tidy. The staff were excellent. The only downside was the food again. The breakfast and dinner was a buffet and the food was always cold.  This needs sorting out.
4679,Very good public transport connections. Spacious and very comfortable room. Excellent buffet breakfast. Great staff and customer services. Excellent food quality for evening meals. Excellent value for money. Lovely outside seating area under cover.....to allow for smoking. 
4680,"Chose the hotel because of the location and reasonable rates but was very disappointed. Very shabby and dirty. Room wasn't cleaned, lukewarm hot water, paint and wallpaper was peeling. The door had only a flimsy chain lock and seemed very insecure.  I'd never stay here again and absolutely discourage anyone to either."
4683,"The rooms were extremelt dated and in need of renovations (everything from lighting, curtains, bathrooms, furniture). Felt like the rooms are from maybe the early 90s. The room felt dark, dingy. Had several friends staying at the hotel as well, and the rooms were in similar need of updating. "
4684,"Just back. Was travelling with my husband and two kids 9&11. Overall not bad, rooms good, food nice and hotel was clean. Pool could have done with more loungers. Only complaint was bar service. I've never experienced anything so slow. Waited 30 mins for a glass of wine and a beer. Still waiting!!! We left and complained at reception but they didn't act on complaint. Reception staff not v pleasant either. "
4685,"I cannot say enough how sweaty their rooms are.  They are like little claustrophobic sweat lodges where you have the privilege of hearing every time your neighbour flushes the toilet. Sometimes the pipes behind the bed just randomly run with water which makes for great comfort as you are sweating it out, attempting to sleep. Just don't... São Paulo has got to have better. "
4686,"The apartment we stayed in was lovely. After complaining the airco worked for 2 days. Then it failed again. Not an huge issue, as there was a lot of wind. We opened all doors and windows. The only complained we have, is that 80% of the staff never smiles, everything takes a long time. The reception has to learn to be friendly, it was appalling how a young boy treated me. He could have told me more tactful, that I was not allowed to stay till 11 o'clock in the morning, but that I had to check out at 10. Just of this impertinent kid, I will never return to this hotel."
4687,"We stayed here on a 1 night stay in Paris. Leaving by TGV next day so this seemed best location.  It was! Lovely building. Lovely foyer. Very nice staff and easy check-in. Room was very small but clean and functional and a very nice bathroom which didn't feel that small - sliding door into it next to bed - slightly unusual location but fine! Breakfast was grand. Small bit hot  food which didn't try. Some meat and cheese, bread and pastries. Nice room.   Only negative - no bar! Surprised when got back late at night - but found 1 open nearby after advice from night porter to try near station.   Would happily use again. "
4688,"The decor of this place just hasn’t worked. It is extremely dark in all public areas, so much that it is very difficult to find your way. The rooms are very odd. Bathrooms all glass with Venetian blinds for privacy but do many glass doors are a health ageand safety issue. Twice I walked into the toilet door which cannot be seen.  No place at all to hang wet towels to dry.  Food average. I doubt that the chef has really seen what a lasagne should look like but certainly the dish bore no resemblance. Waiting staff in restaurant inattentive.would not recommend"
4689,"Unsurprising here are a couple of Indigo hotels in Berlin, since the boutique hotel chain has as a mission to reflect the surrounding art, culture and area, and Berlin has a lot of all of it. The Indigo at Kurfurstendamm is located at the heart of the city moments away from shopping and museums and next to the Berlin Zoo train station. The hotel is about 20 minute taxi ride from the airport, TXL, which will cost less than €20. There is a nice open lobby as well as a spacious bar and restaurant area as you enter the hotel and if you walk down the stairs there is a small but well equipped gym. The rooms are small but very well planned with modern furniture and good amenities, they also have a lot of creative storage. The rooms also uses the indigo colour scheme adding an extra…"
4692,"Based near the Berlin Zoo, this seems to be one of the most popular hotels in Berlin right now.  Stayed in a Jungle Room (view of the zoo) which came with a hammock for relaxing. Beautiful interior design throughout the hotel. Rooms are spacious and gorgeous.   Hotel bar on the 10th floor has phenomenal views of Berlin.   4 stars because this is not a quiet hotel.   Sauna and relaxation room was a welcome treat. "
4696,Wifi didn't work. Restaurant wasn't open when it was supposed to be. Bed wasn't great. Close to the bus station tho. Room was basic but acceptable. Probably wouldn't stay here again. Worth paying a little extra to get the basics you expect from a hotel 
4697,"My wife and I stayed at the Grace Santorini for a night to enjoy their fantastic sunset views. While we enjoyed the marvelous property, we felt service needs some serious improvements at their price point and given this is an Auberge property.  Pickup from the Santorini port, as requested prior to arrival from Mykonos in addition to waiting for almost 30 mins of delay due to ferry running late and finally hauling some pretty heavy luggage up-and-down the way to the hotel was all pretty great.  At the check-in area the view outside the reception was stunning but the area is completely exposed to the sun and in the hot afternoon, a shade there of some sort would be nice as they process the check-in with passport details, take your photos, etc especially if there are multiple…"
4698,"Nice beach and very lovely facility, unfortunately rooms are starting to show there age. The breakfast service wasn't ***** worth: no coffee or tea service respectively permanent forgotten oder ignored orders. Not many guest from europe, mostly asian people. The breakfast service was pretty bad organised. -> disapproved!"
4699,"Service was terrible.  Needed to speak with front desk several times and there were never more than two people working with as many as 10 people in line.  Typically, we traveling with my hilton honors account I received complimentary toothpaste & shaving cream.  At this hotel I had to pay $17 for the same supplies.  Usually free water, but had to buy here."
4700,"For the past 4 years i have been staying at the hotel , and it has always been a fantastic experience, clean spacious room, nice views, amazing and elaborate breakfast, friendly and knowledgable staff, it has met all 5 star standards.  Thank you Intercontinental Carlton Cannes for always making our experience a special one."
4701,"Stayed here for 3 nights with a group of 10 people. The rooms, while nice and large, are very old and felt very shabby and dirty. One couple in our group had a room that smelt like Lynx men’s cologne! We found the staff, in particular the female front desk staff, to be so rude and completely disinterested in their job. They never offered to help with anything and it almost felt too intimidating to ask! Room service was gross and arrived at barely a luke warm temperature. The location however was quite good- lots of good restaurants nearby! In a country where foreigners should not drink tap water, I also think it is outrageous that they do not offer 1-2 bottles of complementary water (note: they only offer still and sparkling water in the mini bar, no other drinks!). Would not…"
4702,"Pleasant stay, nice location, incompetent staff. Got billed twice as the reception was not able to “find my registration”. Have been running after them for two months; they do not answer emails. They still owe me 1000$, I will have to file a plaint. This place is a scam, do not go there."
4703,"We went to Amsterdam with our 13-year-old son and stayed at the NH Amsterdam centre.  The hotel was modern and cool and you can not beat the location.  Lucky to have a corner room, but we actually paid for a different room.  When we discussed the situation with the front desk they apologized that booking.com had sold a room to us with a photo of another room.  They said we must take it up with booking.com and offered no help whatsoever.  They were polite but not going to do one thing for us.  We opted to stay for an additional night (because you need 3 in Amsterdam)  First, we were told they were sold out, then we were told we wouldn't want to stay there because the rooms would be too expensive on the weekend.  Then we were told they had a room and the rate was the same.  I…"
4705,"Stayed there from Sunday 25 to Saturday 31.  Two years ago, I did so, too. Because of that stay, I was looking forward to be back. Well, it looks all very professional. But English skills of staff seem to have dissapeared, mostly in case of customer questions. All staff members from „white shirts“ down to „blue shirts“ are playing with their mobiles. Some sit among the guest having breakfast in the dining room. ???  Air confition is set to 24deg ( not adjustable). Solution proposed by a front desk operator: Open the window. We are offering you a fan. Very practical idea, considering the six lane road outdide. Generally front desk operstors are very busy, the management should consuder to install a ticket machine to have the guests take a ticket and wait. Wolf make it more…"
4706,"They need to change the name. No harbour, no view only a brick wall My room was on the small side but very well appointed and everything I needed Good location close to Southern Cross Station, Sky bus and trams. Well priced"
4708,"Gluten-free bread on purpose !!! Clean and quiet place. Rooms only for 2 or 3 person (They don't provide additional beds for 3+ children !!!) Lidl, Aldi, McDonalds in the neighborhood. 35km from Potsdam."
4709,"My husband and I stayed here on a one night excursion to Chicago. The room we received was in poor condition. Literally, a sheet covered the bed. I called down to the front desk to either turn up the heat (as I had no control) or to bring up some blankets. Nothing arrived. We slept in our pjs with sweatshirts. I kept my jeans on. As I stared at the pealing wallpaper, I thought, ""Are you kidding me?"" Needless to say, we will not be coming back although the location is good."
4710,Well there is so much construction you cant hear yourself think.  The hotel is really a dishelved mess.  There is no easy way to get around as there are so many elevators that only go to certain levels.  The rooms are a maze and difficult to find and the hotel has no room service.  When I was there there was also the labor strike so there were no cleaning staff and the hotel coffee shop and bar was closed.  The entire event was a disaster and we ended up leaving.  Marriott should of just shut this mess down during the renovation and during the strike.  It was not fair to have the guest put in such a predicament and having to walk picket lines and bull Horns and angry hotel workers yelling at us to check out.  Which is what we did....
4711,"Booked through TripAdvisor at the last minute when our train was canceled, and got it at a really good price. Very cool hotel. The rooms were, as people noted, on the small side, but clean, funky, and have have everything you need. Everyone I spoke to at the front desk was very nice and helpful. Close to the Rosenthaler Platz U-Bahn stop, and close to lots of places to eat. Would definitely stay here again."
4712,"The best point regarding this hotel is the location near the large Oriente Railway station making it easy to get to downtown Lisbon.  By the railway station is a large shopping centre with an excellent supermarket, there are also a good number of restaurants on the same street and down by the waterfront.  It is about 10 mins from Lisbon airport. So again convenient.  Otherwise the hotel is just an average business hotel, modern, clean but average with average service.  Breakfast iin the café was OK but I would not eat dinner their a second time...average."
4713,"Located in a nice area, a renovated Hotel and nice managing team. There is a walk to the different metro lines in a 15 minutes walk. The lift is small and located in between the floors, then potential problems for handicap people"
4714,"Our 4 day stay at the Hotel Lumen was a highlight of our month long France holiday. It is very well located within walking distance of many sights (eg The Louvre) and easy access to the Metro. There are many restaurants, cafes and a variety of shopping within easy walking distance too. The Hotel itself:  the staff were very helpful; the room was beautiful; the bed super comfortable; quality bathroom products. The Hotel is also in a one way street - so while it was busy during the day, the noise was at an absolute minimum. We would definitely book again at Hotel Lumen - it was fantastic. Thank you"
4715,"There isn't service at the breakfast. You have to pick up your own coffee, and just one cutlery, they also don't take dirty, empty plates away...nothing...  But the worstes I ever hat was the one special person in service.. Me and my friend was enjoying breakfast outside..a man in service was looking that the door will stay open...(good job) but 2 minutes later an other person from service was closing the door, no hello nothing (we took the table next to the door)...she CLOSED /LOCKED the Door, so we had to walk outside back to the Main Door, past the reception and take again the way to the restaurant... To say: All other days the Door was completly open, and a lot of guests enjoyed there Breakfast outside, but this person in service LOCKED the Door while we were eating…"
4716,Over all I will score Amano 8/10. The rooms was not bad but you have to pay for breakfast. The best thing in this hotel is your gentleman at the reception Brik he is so good always ready to help guest. He made my stay  in the hotel good. 
4718,"My first experience at motel 1 and it was very pleasant. Very friendly staff, great drinks (hot and cold), large lounge. Very clean and simple but not lacking for a short stay. Conveniently situated next to an u bahn station and many places walkable it is a good find.   Only faults would be the lack of safety of the windows - we were on the 9th floor and would not have opened the window had we had children in tow. "
4719,"Overall it is a ok living. But seeing this as a ""hotel"" I would demand more cleaniness. Kinda dirty in the apartment in corners etc. And the sofa was not nice at all. Like a rubber coated sofa so you can easily clean it off kinda type. Hence a sticky-rubber feeling and felt like someone spilled beer in it. The kitchen was the same kinda dirty feeling over. I don't even think the staff checks the inventory if people have really cleaned it or if people just ""washed"" stuff and put it back. The latter was more true when you inspected glasses and so forth.  And just opening the damn balcony door was a huge hassle. Locked and sealed because they are afraid people will get drunk and start shouting or throwing stuff from it (staffs on word). However they did try to open it for me but…"
4720,Mittendrin is a very beautiful hotel.rooms are very comfortable.bathroom is clean.good value for money.every morning had breakfirst.it was delicious and super.wi-fi is fine.specially i would like to thank to sabine.because she is very kind and honest.
4721,"We loved this hotel. It is in the Bastille area, so slightly off the immediate tourist trail, but it is situated only about five minutes walk from the Metro, so it is very easy to get around.   The hotel building has a rich history as a factory, manufacturing wood and more recently chocolate. Indeed the spa pays homage to this offering signature chocolate treatments, which come highly recommended.  The conversion to a hotel has been managed very well and the rooms are of a good size for Paris. As we were travelling with our teenage son, we were given two interconnecting rooms, which was great. We could open our windows and enjoy some great views of the bustling streets below us. Storage is well designed, there are in-room safes and a much appreciated Nespresso machine for an…"
4722,"Great hotel to stay at. Nice location, ultra modern rooms which are very appealing and comfortable. The hotel is kept at a great standard and the staff was nice. The swimming pool, though small, was a lot of fun and is situated at the top floor of the building. That was quite cool. The only upsetting part of the hotel was that our room had a broken glass bathroom door, which had an ugly tape on it to keep it in place. That looked awful. But really, except for that we enjoyed our stay."
4724,"I received a room in the so called older tower of the hotel. And old it was. Furniture scratched and dated, mildew on several spots, wallpaper with stains or simply coming loose. Besides that, the room was very small, cramped and suffocating, and the bathroom is mini-sized: it's one of those bathrooms you'll have to squeeze yourself between the sink and the toilet if you want to close the bathroom door, so never mind being in the bathroom with two persons on the same time as it is impossible. For a room in this price category, definitly look somewhere else."
4725,"The reason for out trip was to take the kids to Six Flags. The location was very good but the room was..... Well, disgusting! Mold and mildew in the bathrooms, and I highly doubt that they actually cleaned the tub or shower or even swept & mopped. They provided toilet paper (the one that was on the roll) but we had to remove it from the roller because the roller didn’t work. When we did run out of toilet paper I had to go to the office and ask for more. The beds were made but we felt very uncomfortable to actually get under the covers scared to see what we would find! No TV remote so we had to stand there and change the channels manually.  Carpet was filthy; paint on the wall was chipping & spotted. Very dirty! For $43 dollars a night, I guess that’s what you get. We were…"
4726,"Roomy, super clean, and comfortable. English speaking channels in the television. Friendly staff.  Plenty of towels offered. Parking downstairs was scary pulling out of ramp onto the street but c’est la vie!"
4727,"I think it would be worthwhile noting that this hotel really is supposed to be like an apartment experience living in Melbourne than a luxury boutique that you thought you were getting when you originally booked the room. If you check in after midnight you have to check yourself in and the instructions are okay at best because the hotel navigation itself is confusing (maybe no fault of the staff). You face out into an alley way or the next business building with lights in the hallways that directly go into your window and its too late to ask for a different room because its past midnight. These are things you'd never get at a hotel or even a real boutique hotel, so sort of a negative experience on that. On top of that, the rooms were very poorly setup, strangely oriented, and…"
4728,The room was too small and was very dirty. The curtains were falling of the rails. Bathroom had rust marks on the bath making it look very dirty. Bath tiles were all cracked. It felt like staying in a cheap motel. 
4730,"Excellent location in regards to the town and sea front but it is up a hill and across a busy road so won't be ideal for everyone. The staff were friendly and helpful. Room was cleaned every day, quite modern with a very comfy bed. The pool area had sun all day up till around 7pm (we stayed in June 2012). The sun loungers were comfy and we mostly had the pool to ourselves when we were there. Air con in the room was really good, temp got cool quite quickly. The wi-fi was free and the signal was strong for our stay. We stayed for 5 nights and would stay there again. There is a bar but they do not do food or snacks past breakfast so we had to go out for lunch but that was not a problem as it is so close to everything."
4731,I have visited Ibis budget long long time back.  Room rent was very genuine. Best things about the hotel were cleanliness and helpful staff.  It's located at very nice location.  S-bahn station is just 2-3 mins walking.  Check point charlie is nearby.  And Potsdam Platz is also just 7-10 mins walking. Nice and budgeted place to stay in the city. 
4732,Visited the Hotel for 5 nights and had a Deluxe room on the 10th floor. Room was very well maintained and restocked every morning. Reception and in fact all the staff were warm and welcoming as is usual in all the Barcelo Hotels we have stayed in. Excellent view from the room spoiled a little by the grill as shown but as we were just a few short steps from the rooftop 36O view bar it wasn’t a problem. I imagine it could get a little noisy from people leaving the bar on a busy night but we heard very little.  Breakfast was ok but choice was limited. A little bit more choice especially in the cooked section would help no end.  The Hotel is close to Liceu and Paral-Lel Metro stations and the Metro is very easy to use.  If I have one reservation and this is in no way the Hotels…
4733,"The good:  - The room was quite comfortable, good value for money;   - Great coffee at breakfast;   - Solid wifi signal;   - Room had a fridge, which is important to me;   - Good check-in experience, allowed me to check-in a little earlier;   - Easy to get to from Tegel.  The not-so-Good:  - Bit far from the metro - the nearest big station is 20 minutes away on foot;   - The room could've used a kettle, my tea loving self needs them."
4734,"We had a great stay at the Libertal.  The area is not the best - think Kings Cross - but we always felt safe and there are lots of small restaurants and cafes around, as well as a little supermarket (with nice sandwiches) and a bakery opposite.  It is easily walkable from Gare du Nord (5-10 min) and has a metro stop moments away.   Our room was immaculate with a comfortable bed.  We upgraded to a premium room - it wasn't much extra and I thought we could do with the extra room. No issues with noise - but the road is busy and you would want to keep the windows shut.   Super helpful on reception. Breakfast was €15 for me and my daughter.  A good selection which she loved - she is a grazer! So glad I chose this hotel. "
4735,"About 10 minutes walk from Berlins centralstation, 15 minutes easy navigated walk to get downtown and has a couple of restaurants/cafés close by. There is a great supermarket 5 minutes away if you turn right when you get to ""Chausseestrabe"" street.   A bit of traffic outside so be prepared for a bit noisy surrounding. The room also had a fan (I don't think there was any airconditioning?) that was a bit noisy but in general the room was clean, nicely decorated and had a broad selection of channels (everything is in german!). There is no minibar in the room, but there is a bottle of water that cost extra.   The hotel had a  breakfastbuffé for 15€ but I did not try that. The only complaint I have is that one of the receptionist was a bit grumpy and did not speak so much english,…"
4736,"I have previously reviewed this establishment favorably, but that was back sometime ago... This new review is from my recent stay about 3+ weeks ago. First, a lot has been said about the location and facilities of this place; having stayed there many times, I must say that the place is on a decline. The members lounge doesn't provide nearly the same services it used to. The nice(r) restaurants from the hotel are all gone and the rooms are starting to look dated and old !!!!....   The main issue that forced this ""Poor"" rating comes from the blatant ""stealing of money"" during this stay. I was charged TWICE for my 5-day stay. Every hotel takes pre-authorization on your CC at check-in but they don't submit 2 settled charges. This hotel sent 2 (one for pre-auth - supposedly !!  and…"
4737,"This hotel says updated, which may be true, but that just means updated to the early 1990s. The inside of our PAID upgraded room here was old and dingy. The hotel staff also neglected to let us know during checkin that their water heater was broken and under repair for the tower we were in. Keep in mind there were rooms available that didn’t have this problem and we weren’t told. After a twelve hour flight, all we wanted was a shower and some sleep. Needless to say, the first did not happen. Neither did the second, as this hotels exterior walls are paper thin and the property is right by a night club or bar. We were on a upper floor and were woken every night by yelling drunk party goers at 2 in the morning. For the price paid, I would have expected at least a decent nights…"
4738,"Rarely do I experience such an ""I don't care attitude."" I took a shower and realized after I did my room hair dresser didn't work. I had to leave for a business meeting but couldn't as I had wet hair. I called the front desk and asked for a new one. After 15 minutes, I requested one again. I waited twenty more minutes. Nothing. I called again. I waited another 15 minutes. Nothing. I explained each time the urgency for a replacement. Finally I called another guest and asked if I could use hers. She got it to me within a couple minutes. The hair dryer never showed up while I was in my room. It shouldn't take 50 minutes to run a hair dryer up to a room."
4739,"This was the worse of the hotels I have stayed at in Brazil. Very noisy, small very basic room. In my opinion it is overpriced and not really anything close by to see. Buffet food was poor and staff very unfriendly. I have never written a bad review before but for the price of this hotel I felt I should warn others. I would not come back here."
4740,"Oia Mare Villas is ideally situated for sunset viewing. The troglodyte suites are nicely decorated and the beds are comfortable. We were there in October, so appreciated a lot the hot tub. So, all you can evaluate from pictures on the hotel website was perfect. But what a difference between “hardware” and “software”! The service was clearly poor. Our bed linen were not changed in 4 days, even after I told the reception that the sand that was in our bed in the morning stayed there after the cleaning lady did her work in our room, and that bed linen were clearly dirty. On another occasion, the hotel organised a trip to neighbour islands for us that was expected to last 4 hours. It lasted 8 hours instead due to poor organisation, including 1.5 hours we had to wait in Phira where we…"
4741,"I really wasn't sure whether it was worth writing this review of the Carmel Valley Ranch further to our recent visit, purely because when we did complain, the staff were so nice and agreeable about it.  And this is why.  We returned a month ago from a 5 week amazing tour of California, 2 adults and 3 kids, aged 17, 13 and 10.  We had been recommended this hotel sometime ago by friends that stayed there about 3/4 years ago.  Upon first impression when we arrived, it was beautiful, with a lovely pool outside.  Despite our room being ready our kids room was not ready until 6pm which to the hotels credit, they did give us a hotel reimbursement.  Our room whilst nice inside had absolutely no view apart from a tree and a car park.  Not the idealic outlook the website portrays.  But my…"
4742,"Stayed for 5 nights, staff were friendly and helpful, rooms were clean and comfortable. I mistakenly left my wedding rings on my bedside table one day, they were still there when we returned.  Thanks for a great stay."
4743,"Stayed here during a business training course. Hotel is in a great location for restaurants, shopping and public transport  People very friendly and excellent breakfast buffet.  We also had lunch provided and again the quality was excellent   Rooms are fine, decor a little tired but acceptable. Only negative was the pillows but just a minor complaint "
4744,"I went to see my daughter in Chicago and see the city. My first time outside of O'Hare Airport. When we arrived, the staff was great, but my wife had made a reservation for two rooms, one under our name and the other inadvertently ended up under my (soon to be) son in law's name. As I was unaware of this, the clerk at the counter could not find the reservation and copped an attitude that I was lying to sneak in an extra room or God knows what...He was arrogant and obnoxious, had my daughter not been there, I would have punched him out. Upon leaving, there was a second charge for valet parking on the same day. We took cabs and never moved the car. When I approached the (same) clerk about it, again with the attitude as if I was lying. This time my daughter wasn't around, but the…"
4745,"Picked up at the train station stop thankfully, as I doubt if we'd gone to find the stop at the airport we would have found it as it is signed for another hotel other than Holiday inn. However, taken by the complimentary bus which is great. Arrived at the hotel and swiftly and efficiently dealt with at reception. For some reason we had been allocated a 4 person room despite there only being 2 of us. We were quickly given a 2 person room unfortunately I think it was as far away from reception as we could have possibly been. Arrived at the room all clean and tidy but only set up for a single person i.e. 1 large towel and one hand towel, 1 single duvet and exceedingly more importantly only 1 wafer ;-). Traipsed all the way back to reception and reported the problem. Excellently…"
4746,"I stayed two nights Oct. 19-21 for travel. I originally booked my stay next door, a popular highway motel. Decided to give this motel a try and I regret doing it because the place just look very tired. From the exterior to the interior you know this place lose its battle from the past, present and maybe future guest. The location is great no doubt about it, same as the motel next door which by the way doing its part to fix their rooms. One outstanding features about these motels are the housekeepers, no matter how run down these places are, these employees tried their best to keep your room clean and sanitize as much as possible. We travelers often overlook these people, next time we stay in this type of motel  please acknowledge their effort by saying ""thank you"" it does not…"
4747,"The hotel is a 20 minute walk to Fishermans Wharf.  The rooms were disgusting... dirty and unkept.  There was garbage under the sink in the bathroom.  It almost seemed as if the room was not cleaned.  There were scuff marks on the walls and dirt in the corners.  The parking is under the building and the spots are so small, your car might not fit. It was so bad that we left and went to the Holiday Inn at Fishermans Wharf! Do yourself a favor and DO NOT stay here. There are MUCH better options, closer to Fisherman's Wharf, and almost the same price!"
4748,"A brilliant choice for a well-positioned stay in Paris. Metro at only 3 minutes walk, decently decorated throughout,and a PARTICULARLY good breakfast buffet. The staff were fabulously helpful in sorting out a problem which I had caused by my wrongly booking a date in March instead of February."
4749,"Stayed at the Hotel de Varenne which was lovely, room was spacious ,clean and well equipped. Staff at hotel were efficient and friendly. Easy for Metro and plenty of places to eat. All round could not fault it excellent stay."
4750,"We had such a wonderful time in Cannes we did not want to leave. The hotel was lovely, albeit the rooms were in need of updating, however the quality of bedding, towels, robes etc were fantastic,  and the staff were amazing, especially Alexander in the bar.  The level of service and attention to detail was exceptional.  Breakfast was a highlight, beautiful selection of fresh fruits and savoury dishes with an extra surprise, which you won’t get in many places, and you won’t get a better Aperol Spritz anywhere. The only negative point was having to pay for sun bed and umbrella at the beach each day, I feel if you are a hotel guest in a hotel of this standard, this should be included in the price.  However, the staff at the beach club (Paloma in particular) looked after us…"
4751,"I will start with the positives.  The room was lovely, and the location was beautiful.    The negatives, there are quite a few.  And whilst I normally would not fault a hotel for a lot of these things, at the price they charge its really not acceptable.   The food: I don't think there was one meal that came out with what it said on the menu.  The excuse was often 'we ran out'.  I had to send multiple dishes back because they replaced ingredients with things I was allergic to.   a) if you run out of something it usually appropriate to TELL the customer and let them make the decision about what they want to eat. b) the menu was huge, if you can't supply the food reliably DON'T PUT IT IN THE MENU!!.  You can have weekly/daily specials for some interesting items -> when they are in…"
4753,"First I want to say that the hotel was very presentable, and I do not have any frustrations with the quality of the rooms. The meeting spaces were also very well managed and the staff for the meeting spaces was very courteous. My frustrations were with the staff on the hotel side. First off, the front desk staff began the check in process while I was still some ways away from the counter, the lobby was very noisy and the staff seemed frustrated with my request to repeat themselves. This behavior occurred each time I approached the front desk for something. I also had a bill dispute to make after my stay and the lady I spoke with on the phone was fairly rude and unhelpful- she even hung up on me.  Additionally, the cost of parking seems fairly ridiculous to me. As I understand…"
4754,This might be the worst hotel experience of my life. Unfriendly and unhelpful staff. Thin walls and dirty rooms. This is an old gross apartment building that was made into a hotel. Right next to two halfway houses and I could hear screaming all night. Not safe in any way. I will never stay here again. Please warn your coworkers to stay away! 
4755,"Booked to get away over xmas. Firstly dress code, the clientele here really like to dress up and im talking suits and bow-ties and dresses. If your not then you will be 'stared' at. If you like dressing up then this is the place for you. Food wasnt great at all. I eventually stuck to pasta..it was a safe bet. If you are vegitarian... Good luck as there isnt an good range also veggie stuff (vegitables) next to meat so lots of cross contamination with meat food dropping into veggie stuff or people using meat utensils in the veggie stuff. The wine, red, white and sparkling was of very dire quality., however if you like spirits then your fine. All in had an ok time but would not come back here or recommend it. This was expensive and certainly failed to deliver on my expectations."
4756,My room was run down and overpriced.  Bathroom needed upgrading.  Much better places to stay in sfo?  Breakfast and happy hiur fine.  Not 24 hour service as share with white swan next door.  Very disappointed as i picked hotel based on good reviews but did nothing for me
4757,"The foyer area of the hotel was very impressive and the staff were extremely friendly. I found the rooms let the hotel down, beds were hard, the lights were panel controlled rather than a switch which sounds great but when you want to go the bathroom in middle of night you can’t easily identify where/what light to put on. Our room also was directly across from another building and so you could never leave curtains open as they could see right into room from across street. Finally there was no mention that the shower was open plan in the room so whilst it was fine for me as I was with my partner it would not have been practical otherwise (also another reason why we had to keep curtains closed the whole time)."
4759,"This is my first bad review on La Quinta. I have always stayed at La Quinta but this one the staff was horrible, breakfast was crap, biggest complaint was no pool when they advertise they have a pool. Was not happy with management at all."
4760,Stayed here a few times when away with work. Nice views of the sea to be had on the front. Outside space is lovely with a well stocked bar.  The breakfast buffet is huge never seen such a massive choice including champagne and fondue. Like the breakfast here!  
4761,"The hotel claims to have a gym. That is not correct. The gym i tiny, the equipment is one treadmill, one cycle and one multi function station that is broken... Also, they use the gym for storage of extra chairs."
4762,"Arrived yesterday for a few days' stay.    Hotel amenities are generally nice.  Spa in good condition.  Pool is warm but nearby construction is very loud.   Room looks good but odd in several ways:  - Our king sized bed is two full beds pushed together.  So there is a crack in the middle. Not very comfortable.   - There is a desk in our room. But no chair to sit in.   - We have an ironing board but no iron.   Overall so far it's ok, just odd.  Also carpet looks rather dirty.  "
4763,Shame about the unfriendly reception staff. On arrival as a guest you are made to feel inferior and a hindrance. The location of the hotel is good but I think there are probably friendlier places to stay on Copacabana Beach than this particular one. The roof terrace and pool overlooking the beach is the only good thing about this hotel.
4764,"This resort mainly targets families and large groups, so don't expect a romantic, zen-like atmosphere. It is also a Vietnamese development with a primarily well-off Vietnamese costumer base.  Most foriegn guests are from other East Asian countries, so it doesn't cater to Western sensibilities or expectations regarding service and English language capability of the staff.   Thats fine.  I am an experienced traveller in Vietnam and knew all this coming in. The nearby Ocean Villas development is similar in all of the above ways, but I found to be enjoyable and far superior to the Vinpearl Ocean resort. The pros and cons of the Vinpearl are given below.  PROS  The villas are spacious and built to a high standard.  Furnishing and fixtures are modern, luxurious and clearly very new. …"
4765,Stayed in December 2016 for the ILTM once more. This year I decided to stay in a less expensive Hotel.  I have to say I was positive surprised. I booked the Hotel after a friends recommendation and I was not disappointed! Very good located just 5 minutes away from the Congress Hall. Rooms nice and clean.  They even serve breakfast which is just fine for starting the day. Highly recommended if you are looking for a budget Hotel See you in 2018!
4766,"I had the luck to stay in the superior suite of the Astoria... the suite in an incredible, luxury apartment... the view is WOW! almost 360 degrees view from one of the highest building in the center.... of course suites are at the top floor.  I found service very poor for that price (700 euros per night or more) and the breakfast was  the minimum required for a 5 star hotel. Plus on the check in day they kept waiting 2 hours in the hall for my room!!"
4767,"Stayed here a few weeks ago nice hotel no issues. Checked in and out with friends credit card no charges did not use room service or anything. Came home to find they have taken a very large number of dollars out credit card. No reason for this, despite emails situation remains totally unresolved. Friend now having to try and claim back through credit card. Very dissatisfied"
4768,It is a wonderfully cute hotel with friendly and helpful staff. My wife and I have stayed there twice and just grew to love it more the longer we were there. Would difinently recommend.from the layout of the rooms to the wallpaper it felt like the perfect Parisian experience.
4769,"The hotel is in a great location right next to loads of restaurants and bars. It's is also walking distance to all of the major attractions which is great. The room sizes are good however we found the rooms to be very hot with the outside temperature around 2 degrees, we was still hot with the air con on. "
4770,"One of the good hotels i have stayed. Staff was very friendly and cooperative, House keeping woman was excellent, Reception Girl Ninette (Sorry if Spelt Wrong) was very helpful ..Breakfast was amazing Everything was so fresh specially Orange juice,Bread.. They upgrade our room and the room was big with all facilities, House keeping was on daily bases.  The Hotel Location is very ideal if you walk on your right side you can reach Eiffel Tower and River Seine in 20 Minutes and if you walk on your left side you can reach Notre Dame and all other attractions in 20 Minutes ..all Metro Stations are on short distance. Once again thanks for making our stay so special.."
4771,"Hotel Gabriel is a gem! Excellent location, close to two metro stips and surrounded by many restaurants. The staff provided excellent sevice and our room was always kept clean. Breakfast was great too."
4772,Fabulous location overlooking museum island and close to many cafes/restaurants and sightseeing bus stop. Hotel breakfast selection is excellent. A reason for the 4 star rating is down to the hotel housekeeping. If you’re a tea drinker bring your own tea bags! A coffee maker and coffee is provided in your room but for tea drinkers all you get is a kettle. Luckily I always bring my own tea bags and bought milk in a nearby shop. Not sure housekeeping like this though as I used the expresso cups in the room to make tea...next day cups were gone and not replaced again during our stay! Good job I also travel with a reusable cup. Also used the face cloths in the bathroom...never replaced after first day either. Did ring housekeeping to ask for both cups and tea towels...never…
4773,"Fantastic host, great location, amazing experience. Sabine's breakfast table with champagne was the best that I have ever had. Room had high tech cd player and TV and welcoming chocolates and candles were nicely presented. Bed was very comfortable.Toilets were clean and had bath robes and slippers. I would recommend it highly."
4775,Hotel was an extra 85 a night after fees that were not disclosed at time of booking. Hotel was under Reno outside so view I paid extra for was blocked and entire hotel was covered in black cloth. Couldn't open windows to let air in bc they were taped and papered shut from the painting going on. AC sucked and it was hot and muggy in the room the entire stay even though we asked for someone to come look at it day 1. I've had better experiences at Best western motels than at this place. It's also at the corner of tenderloin district which is super sketchy. Spend your money elsewhere. 
4776,"Had a room in a block booking for a business trip and arrived on Monday night. They had my booking down as Sunday and as I didn’t show on Sunday, they completely cancelled my 4 night booking based on “no show”. They did not contact me (on any channel) to check if I was still coming nor did they check with the individual who block booked. Instead they just cancelled it and gave the room to someone else. After an 8 hour flight followed by an hour plus in a cab in traffic this is never going to improve your mood. I was in Chicago for a conference and as such there were no reasonable hotel rooms available anywhere near and I had to book something almost an hour away. The staff did not try to find something else for me and did not apologise. Terrible experience."
4778,"How to say something when there is nothing to say ....everything is perfect ..the rooms are fantastic especially when one is tired of boring standardized rooms or old fashioned design. Unique it is and great beds, strong showers and cleanliness is perfect which is not always the case in Paris hotels. Now the best at Hotel Original is the staff and I mean all the staff from management to ladies at the breakfast etc etc    If you read all reviews it is mentioned everywhere that the staff is great so there must be a reason. Friendly, cool, helpful so not the usual ""robots"" you meet in hotel chains.  In terms of location i personally discover an area close to the Marais which is vibrant and very interesting. If you want to visit Paris center and the departments stores the Bus nr. 20…"
4780,"Stayed in this hotel during the Berlin Marathon weekend, and its location is perfect for access to the city center, popular tourist spots, shopping, and eating out. Very nice and clean hotel, and ideal for relaxation, as the name suggests. I would stay here any day anytime."
4781,"A nice hotel to be. Spent a night but had a nice time. Nice reception, rooms and restaurant, with friendly Services. Though my first trip to Germany but was worth it staying at Steigenberger. Had free WiFi connection, good restaurant to ensure u don't get hungry and a cozy bed ro lay after a sumptuous meal. Lol. "
4782,Plugged drain in shower led to quickly flooding bathroom floor because of lack of shower door/lip around shower. No handrails on narrow spiral stairs. No rail on loft in bedroom. The other room i booked was extremely small. No room to move. Disappointed because pictures of hotel looked amazing. 
4783,"There is a $12 amenity fee per day that is not mentioned when booking thru 3rd party websites or at check in, and you can not opt out of this. This supposedly includes beach towel, chair, mat rentals and ""free"" breakfast. It's really too bad because we liked this hotel until we got the bill. It's clean and service is good but the business practices are to be questioned."
4784,"We stayed here as part of our tour. The location was good-close to shopping, restaurants and one of the Christmas markets. The room was ok, but older. I didn't have as many electrical outlets as newer properties. The lobby and the bar were more modern."
4785,"Just about average. The hotel wasn’t the cleanliest. I mean things like Stains on pillows, cushions and the sofa. The rooftop was a great view, but the guy at the bar didn’t serve me so after 15mins I decided I’ll go elsewhere. The lights were out on my floor which did make it rather spooky. But the location was good close to the dragon bridge, but far away from bars and restaurants."
4786,"We went to redbury new York and the hotel is perfect thats why we choose the one in Miami, very bad choice, we arrived around noon , room was not ready , ok we wait, they finally give us a room next to the construction horrible experience , I will no recommend  to anybody!"
4787,Second stay at this hotel. The hotel itself is fine with good breakfast and nice pool. The main point of the hotel is its proximity to the airport and the free transfer provided. For some reason the hotel makes this difficult. There is no information on the hotel website or booking confirmation leaving guests reliant on others reviews. We got to the airport about 2315 and found the linx phone to contact the hotel but either it was not working or nobody picked up. Not being sure if the bus would come regardless we paid for a taxi instead. We told the guy on reception who couldnt care less.   The other annoying thing is they only ever seem to have one person on reception so if you do get the free transfer you can look forward to a wait to check in.  There was only one towel in the…
4788,This hôtel is near by place de la nation métro station. I stay over there two nights. Thé staff are very friendly specially Mr. Antonio and others staff they speak english. Hé also say namaste to  us. Thé rooms are neat and clean. Breakfast is better. Thé staff of this hôtel help us to visit Paris and identified thé métro station for this. Near this hôtel also find out indian and chinise restaurant for delious food. 
4789,"Great location, trading on that. Compared with other Shanghai properties this place needs a lot of work - staff don’t really care about helping and don’t even think about trying to get a taxi in the rain! But an umbrella and walk to the metro!"
4790,"Having just spent 4 nights at Westin Berlin, we enjoyed our stay.  Upon check-in, there were some mistakes made on the hotels part. However, a talk with Alix (Reception) and Patrick (Manager), we were impressed with their excellent customer service skills which made us feel like they really care about guests. So, thank you to both.  The hotel certainly has charm. We spent some time in a standard room and found it comfortable but eventually moved to a Suite which was great.  You must be realistic; this hotel is not brand new, and was infact the only 5* hotel in East Berlin during the wall era. With that, I would say that this hotel has real old-world charm. While this would not be a hotel we'd normally go for (we are more into our modern comforts), after staying here we really…"
4791,"We had to wait for an hour after the check in time, till housekeeping cleaned our room. Just after the cleaning the floor was dirty and there was a bit stinky, though the apartment itself was nice and large enough."
4792,"The setting is impressive and facilities are beautiful. There are some inconveniences related to facilities. Going from the bedrooms to the dining room and entrance of the hotel, you have to go down stairs and elevators although the buildings are next to each other in the same floor. We got a upgrade in our room and received a room with amazing views of the river. We were grateful for that. The bed is the lowest point of the hotel. Two single beds joined together with single bed linen. It didn't feel that we were sleeping together. The mattress was not the most comfortable. Breakfast was plenty, but personally I didn't enjoy their selections. Pool is an infiniti pool looking at the river: beautiful. I didn't like seeing pigeons bathing and drinking the pool water!  It is a…"
4793,Hotel that looks cool on the outside and has clean but small rooms. Weakest point is the service with waiters barking at each other during breakfast or waitresses so busy talking on their talkies that they block your way to the buffet. Drinks are overpriced and food sub par (imagine breakfast donuts that are so hard you can commit a crime with them).
4795,I just stayed 2 nights in NH Lisboa campo grande . I opcion for this hotel because of a good deal i got 53 euros night included breakfast. The location of the hotel is good close to the airport 5 euros with uber. Metro station just next door and some food shops also just around the corner. I arrived around 11pm i went to buy a water in the bar that cost me 5 euros. Rooms are ok but you can listen the noise from the next rooms what is very unpleasant. Breakfast was good but no eggs i think this is the 1st hotel i have been that have no eggs in the buffet. I just noticed that is possible to have eggs when a guest asked about it and the waiter explained that is possible to do it. I am sure about 80% of the guest will not bother to ask about it!! The gym is ok very small and limited…
4796,"Stayed there 5 nights and room was really clean and nice! Bed was comfy! Towels can be changed every day if you want. Location was great, bus right from the airport and other public transport near also. Wifi didn’t work in room."
4797,"We stayed in this Grand Hotel during a long week in Lisbon and we can say that the hotel is quite stylish and in a beautiful position, near Marques de Pombal square and undergound station, near a beautiful park and easy to get to from Lisbon city airport. The cost is, however, proportional to the location and service you get. We also tried the restaurant and, as said for the hotel, you get what you pay for, and you pay almost a lot."
4799,"We wanted to stay in the Marais, and I found this hotel on the internet. We were extremely happy with our stay, and will return here again. The hotel is spotless. While our room was a bit small, it had a wood beam running through the ceiling which lent it that Parisian ambience. And the bathroom was spacious with a wonderful tub for bubble baths. The breakfast was huge with many choices. A metro stop is kitty-corner across the street, and the neighborhood is very nice with grocery stores and cafes within a block of the hotel. Sam at the front desk was so nice, and gave me special flower honey for my sore throat...thanks, Sam.  I'll be back!"
4800,"I have gone a lot of places with family and friends and this is very low on my list. Basic hotel. It does the job of housing you for your trip but no nice amenities that make you go ""wow"". They are all very basic. Pool is simply an oval. No poolside service. No jacuzzi. The best part of the hotel is the location next to Starbucks and lulus restaurant. Tucker and Bevvy is a little cafe next to the lobby which has amazing smoothies as well. Rooms are very small. Housekeeping is by far the worst of the hotel. Literally all they do is come in and replenish towels and make your bed they do not clean anything in the bathroom or on the floor. Definitely better hotel options in Waikiki. "
4801,"We stayed here for three nights in June.  The hotel is in an excellent location, really close to a very large supermarket and S Bahn for transport.   I had booked a king double room, the room was very small, but no big deal as we liked being out sightseeing. The bathroom and room was spotlessly clean, bed was so comfortable and excellent organic shower gel etc.  Our room had a view of the train station but the rooms were very quiet and we slept very well.   The staff were friendly and the bar modern and comfortable for a drink before heading out.   We didn’t have breakfast as there a lots of places to eat really close for cheap.   The area itself is very urban and cool, safe.   Would recommend and will use this hotel chain again.   "
4802,"This is our sixth time staying at this ApartHotel.   We have always enjoyed the location, being easy walking distance from Friedrichstrasse Bahnhof and pleasant strolling distance from the Hauptbahnhof, the Reichstag and Under den Linden.   The Business Apartments, which we have always chosen, are ideal for comfort and independence.  This time we found the breakfast room changed with benches and stools replacing some of the tables and chairs, which we prefer.   The breakfast selection is as good as ever, except we did refer the kannchen of filter coffee rather than the - to us - sterile machine version. We found the staff at Reception and in the Breakfast Room very efficient.  To us long-distance, non-business travellers, however, we found that though polite and respectful, the…"
4803,"All rather weird. Decor is modern, but not to our older taste. Bar has a table football and TV, so can be loud. Bar choice of drinks is limited. Booked into the restaurant for dinner at 7pm, but when we turned up, it was closed...although they did say they would open it, if we wanted!!! Choice on menu was very limited. So, went elsewhere.  This is an okay place, but not if you want a quite restful time in Lisbon."
4804,"We have stayed here many times and enjoyed our stays. My wife and I had made reservations to spend the Thanksgiving week here in February. This was to be a special trip because my cousin and his wife just had their first child and this would have been our first Thanksgiving with the new member of our family as well the first time my wife, mother, my cousins mom, and I would have got to meet him. Today my wife and I called to confirm our reservations as we always due and we were told that we in fact did NOT have a reservation and that the establishment was filled and there was nothing they would be able to do for us for that week. As I pressed the woman I was speaking with she asked if I had the email with the reservation on it, unfortunately I was unable to find the email…"
4805,"Even better than expected, based on prior reviews - location on the edge of Mitte is really convenient to U-bahn and tram. Rooms were spacious and well maintained. Shower and bathroom were ultra modern  "
4806,"Going to make this a short one. Yes, great location, the room and bathroom are not bad. But, the AC is controlled by reception, not you. Which if I'm paying for my room I would like control of my AC unit. The breakfast is not the best. No eggs in sight. Only breads, cereal, some ham and cheese and coffee. So if you have a gluten allergy you pretty much have nothing to eat."
4807,"You should be concerned about booking this hotel.  I secured two rooms with my credit card when I made the reservations for an overnight in August.  One room was for my husband & me and one for my brother & sister-in-law. When we checked in my brother-in-law gave the desk clerk his credit card for his room and they charged him for his room. They already had my credit card for our room, but I still asked the desk clerk to confirm that I was charged for only one room.  When my Amx bill came I was charged for two rooms instead of one.   Things happen and I wasn't upset at the error thinking that I'd make a phone call and get it quickly resolved. It is now December and after repeated calls to the property leaving messages I not only haven't had the problem corrected I have yet to…"
4808,"Well-run hotel and nice rooms in a very central location in West Berlin. Close to Bahnhof Zoo, great shopping and dining. Clean and mostly spacious rooms. I've styed here many times and will keep doing so when in Berlin!"
4811,Super recomended hotel. The room is very clean and the crew is so kind and helpful.  King size bad  wifi - for free Very nice spa - for free Very well located.. many resurants and coffee.  We will be back again on our next trip to Berlin.
4812,"The Fjord is easy to reach from Tegel Airport or the main train station.  There are two U2 stations nearby: Gleisdreieck and Mendelssohn-Bartholdy Park.  Once checked into the hotel the desk clerk can show you shortcuts that are not obvious by looking at a map before you arrive, so the distance to the UBahn is actually closer than it might appear.  The hotel is located a few blocks from Potsdamer Strasse, where you can catch several buses.  Potsdamer Platz is very walkable, just a few blocks.  I stayed on the top floor where there are balconies for each room and lots of light for the interior.  The hotel staff when I stayed (Nov-Dec 2015) were all very friendly, helpful, with excellent English language fluency.  There is a breakfast available for purchase, a fairly standard…"
4814,"This is a highly overpriced lodging with extremely overpriced restaurant !! Bungalows are spacial but oldfashion and with open plan, even to the bathroom. There is no door to the bathroom, so everyone are aware of what you are doing in there, both inside and outside. There is no fan in the bathroom. Around the top of the exterial walls is a four decimeter airgap resulting in free access to mosqitos, larvae, bugs, lizards and bats. There is also a cat that climbs the wall and gets inside. Bags have to be closed as dogs and cats, ants and cockroaches come looking for food inside the bungalow every day. We flushed 2-10 big cockroaches down the drain every day. Sometimes the lizards and bugs/cockroaches fell down from the roof. Ants and small bugs are everywhere. We booked a…"
4815,Arived early and were able to check in early which is great when you are travelling from early that day.. Our room was on the very top floor and we had great views of Berlin. The room it's self was Ok clean yes spacious yes bed very comfortable but the room was cold the radiator was never on also could hear the traffic outside very clearly as the windows were old wooden ones. We had a kitchen which was useless basically because they give you no cutlery what so ever but the fridge came in handy. The staff were great and friendly.  Tip: bus 100 picks up outside the hotel and drops off just across the road. It's goes past all main sights and is a fraction of the cost of the tour bus which costs €24 per person. 
4817,"I stayed with a friend (separate rooms). Good location, away from the hustle and bustle and within walking distance (1/2hr) to main attractions. Underground is close by as well.  Rooms were nice and clean (not totally soundproof). Good size rooms and bathrooms. Shower was great. Well equipt rooms (ironing board,iron,hairdryer, desk). Friendly staff, one who gave us a good recommendation for a place to eat and booked a table for us and called us a taxi.  Paid extra €12 each per day for breakfast,which was worth it. Loads to choose from.  Would visit again and recommend to stay here."
4818,"Not what we expected, not the same hotel. I only wish I could leave a 5-star rating for the Hotel Zephyr. Hidden fees and already overpriced. Dirty room. Unpleasant and downright rude staff: receptionist and manager. Customer service could NOT be worse.  Stayed at the Zephyr previously with one of my older sons 4 years ago, back when it was the Radisson. Was our first time visiting San Francisco. Amazing hotel, outdoor pool which my son enjoyed the most. Very friendly and helpful staff. Overall very pleasant experience.. back then.  Soon after our stay in 2013, one of my younger sons was saving up for HIS turn to visit San Francisco and stay at the same hotel. He worked hard, even sold some of his favorite electronics to put money away in his savings account. He saved up for a…"
4819,I really liked the Hotel. Rooms are not extremely big but very comfortable and clean. Breakfast is good and provides some variety. Internet speed is ok and free of charge. Even parking was free of charge (positive surprised). I can definitely recommend this Hotel. It's also good located.
4820,"Stayed in the lovely and comfortable Modern Room, which is the largest. of the bedrooms and has a well-appointed private bath. Sabine is a wonderful hostess who went out of her way to arrange a very pleasant stay, including preparing fabulous breakfasts, helping with taxi arrangements and providing train travel information. The location is just perfect. Berlin was encountering a warm spell during my visit, so air-conditioning would have been nice....but multiple small fans in the room worked quite well to keep it cool."
4821,"Just got back from this hotel for my husbands birthday and it was in a perfect location away from the city centre but close enough by metro. Rooftop pool is small but clean Gym on top floor Room are spacious, very comfortable beds and good showers.  Minifridge in room is handy.  Breakfast is pricey for what you get.  Rambla poblenou is two mins away and has plenty of lovely bakery's and small cafes perfect for lunch, dinner and breakfast.   Lots of small restaurants nearby where u can sit outside.  Reception staff are all fantastic. Very helpful, friendly and professional.  Large hotel with a personal feel.  Stay here if you want to be near the beach and away from the city centre. Supermarkets are close by also. Beach is a local beach but suitable for all. Good for couples and…"
4822," Overall the rooms are excellent and were cleaned to a high standard each day, also the porters were very helpful and the general greeting is fantastic.  The biggest area for improvement would be in both the bars, the service is slow and they ran out of Heineken beer in each, the local Sagres beer seemed to be flat one day as well. Also the number of glasses was a problem with only 3 pint glasses and 3 big gin type glasses available. The downstairs bar also ran out of Blue Sapphire gin and still didn't have any available the next day."
4823,"Good price. Normal ibis budget accommodation, simple. Clean. A few minutes walking to postdamer platz and checkpoint charlie. It would have been great to have bikes to hire in the hotel. Rude guy at the reception. Except that, everything was good. "
4824,"When you walk into this place you're greeted with style and comfort. That feeling is radiated throughout and they have gone to many details to make it warm and cosy.  My partner said our room looked like a lovers suite, with a huge double bed, Decorated sideboard, big high back reading chair with lit corner. We have a built in kitchenette with small cooking facilities. Has all the shower amenities you'd expect. I will come back again."
4825,"The hotel has a good position, as it's walking distance from the Berlin zoo and aquarium and the famous shopping mall KaDeWe. It's also close to the Potsdamer platz. It's clean, the staff is kind, only the housekeeping doesn't understand english. ;) the rooms are a bit small, all the rest is OK."
4826,"The hotel is outdated. Old rooms, very old carpet, wallpaper tearing apart... Non smoking rooms are a shame! They only spray something in the room but you can still smell smoke from cigarrettes. It is terrible. Windows don't open. Far away from the city center and everything else. No restaurants around to go at night by walking. There is very long line for check out and it can take almost one hour to check out. You hardly find a table to have you breakfast. Rooms are noisy and you can hear everything from the next room or corridor."
4828,"This is the worst place to stay. Honestly, I probably would have been better staying at Red Roof Inn. The rooms are mediocre. The front desk service is sub-par. The fact that they charge you $13.00 a day to park in a nearly empty parking lot is highway robbery. Just what they charge 120.00 a night for, I haven't figured out yet. Then, on top of that, they continue placing holds on my card everyday for ""incidentals"" even though I haven't charged a thing to my room. What is that about? I understand keeping a card on file, but continuously placing holds on my account for nothing being charged is ridiculous. I stayed here because I figured a big name like Marriott would have excellent customer service, but because of this stay I will not return to Marriott ever again."
4829,"Staff were great, beds were terrible, towels were threadbare, breakfast staff were overworked, breakfast  was poor, despite all this, we had a great time.a lot needs to be done with the organisation of the place, but it is all possible in a place like that."
4830,"The hotel location is great on the Kamari beach pedestrian road. The external of the hotel is well maintained including 3 pools bar and restaurant. However the reception is at least 10 years old, the couches are dirty and old. Same for the hotel rooms they have old and outdated furniture as well as dusty old curtains. The TV has no satellite just greek channels. Wifi is only in the hotel no wifi in the restaurant. The restaurant and bar give you a 10% discount but the prices are high to start with (espresso coffee 2,70 euro). The Spa is not free, Treatments are payable and the jacuzzi is 10 euro. They have a small private beach but if you don't go down there early in the morning around 8 you won't find any free sunbeds and a lot of people have complained. The pool closes at…"
4831,"Web site misleading , thought we had harbor views !!!!! No views, ours was over over a construction site . The studio apartment very small and very disappointed . Will never come back and will never recommend this to anybody. We would rather stay at a hotel and receive great service for the price, front desk not welcoming ."
4833,Had to sit in the bar area in coats (if you can call it a bar) first bottle of beer was out of date. No customer service - give it a miss. Location only 20 minutes from Pudong airport but nothing near by.
4834,"The W Chicago overcharged my debit card by $309, and explained that I would be refunded within 30 days. 30 days. There isn't a soul working in the W that has the power to issue an immediate credit back to your bank account. You are also charged the full amount of your stay plus $200 in incidentals upon checking in. You don't sign any paperwork indicating this, and you aren't informed by the hotel clerk. Don't worry though, you'll be refunded that $200 sometime within 30 days. Maybe. Not always.  Hopefully, when turning on your room television, you don't mind being deafened by the default settings. No matter what you do, the television will reset the settings when powered off.  This is an overpriced hotel furnished by IKEA. You'll be worried to use anything in the room due to…"
4835,"This hotel is very central, off Kurfurstendamm, and it's surrounded by wonderful little restaurants where you can sit outside, have a great dinner and sip your wine. Like all over Europe, no one will push you out. A lot of people sit there with a beer for hours. The hotel is super spacious, a little older looking, although it has been renovated maybe 10 yrs ago. We had a room facing the street, and it was exceedingly noisy, so request a room facing the back of the building, although I suspect that you will still be able to hear all the noise coming from the street until very late. Even though it was May and not hot, I still love my air conditioning but there was none, so do not choose this if you go in Summer. The breakfast can only be described as exceptional. All in all, a…"
4837,"The breakfast was horrible served in a small, dirty and caotic area.  Front desk employees have a lack of motivation for customer service. We arrived at the hotel at 3:20 PM and we waited for 1 hour in the lobby because the reserved room was not yet ready."
4838,"Checked in early, which was nice but our Ocean view is a small glimpse of the ocean in between two hotels.  The room is musty and we've been here for 3 hours and now the pool has been closed down without any reason.  Oh and after coming here a few years there is no poolside service. If you want good beach access don't expect it here.  We still have 4 more nights and are really regretting our decision, but already locked into the stay.  You should really consider this before you book.....it's gone downhill over the years! "
4839,"I do not recommend staying at Club Quarters Hotel in San Francisco. We checked in to the Club Room and decided it was a little too small so we asked to upgrade at the front desk. We upgraded to the Superior Room for an extra fee for our 5-night stay.   Mid-morning on our 4th day, we received a knock at the door from someone asking when we were checking out. We told him we were booked for one more night so not until the next day, but he said that’s not what he had on record. We called down to the front desk and they said they had us scheduled to check out after the 4th night and check back in for a 5th night. They insisted we pack up our room, go downstairs to check out, and check back in to a different room because the Superior Room we had upgraded to was booked for that night.…"
4840,"Very friendly staff and very cozy atmosphere in a fancy hip setting. The rooms are nice and the location perfect for tourists and business visitors. The interiors are classy, designer but also very inviting keeping a nice vibe. "
4841,"I had booked a room for Saturday Sept 3rd. I spent my day at the Navy Pier and checked into this hotel at 11:30pm. Upon arrival, was told that they are over booked and gave my room away. However, they offered a room next door at the Residence Inn. I specifically booked this hotel and location because of the features offered by this hotel: breakfast and a pool. The front desk stated I can still come back to Hyatt to use these services. I am 8 months pregnant, traveling alone with a toddler. I'm not about to go back and forth between two hotels for their pool and for breakfast. No one from Hyatt bothered to notify their guests that their rooms were given away. 2 other guests came behind me and were also told they had no rooms available.   What is this?! Hotels can just give away…"
4842,"Centrally located near to all ""East"" attractions.  Lots of restaurants and bars close by.  Floor to ceiling windows are spectacular, if a bit impractical.  Two complaints - we had upgraded to a suite so we would get free in-room wifi, which did not work the whole time we were there, when reported to reception their response was they would reboot the server, which made no difference at all, also  is a lot made of the very trendy pop up bar, even an article in the magazine in the room, but when we tried to get a drink at 11 pm on the Friday evening, we were told they had just closed!"
4843,"We stayed for 4 nights on our first trip together in 2 years. Firstly the pros:  1. Large bed, comfy and spacious rooms for price considering Amsterdam's average hotel prices. 2. Great social area with table tennis, pool table etc. 3. Good food at the restaurant, although lacking in variety.   But the cons are key to improvement:  1. Cannot open the window. 2. Relying solely on the air conditioning, where you can see quite a lot of particles in the air, off putting to sleep in! 3. One memeber of staff at the bar had a on/off attitude for an evening meal. But the rest were fantastic. 4. Shower curtain should be replaced by a glass panel. Water went everywhere!   All in all, we would possibly visit again, 3/3.5 out of 5. Good for Amsterdam prices. "
4844,"I use this hotel second time for business.  10~15 minutes away from the festival de palais by walk. There's a bath tub which is not broken. Breakfast is included to the accommodation. Staff are very kind. There's a cute dog at the lobby, he is so calm. No worry!"
4845,"Whilst the bedrooms are perfectly adequate, most of them are nothing special.  The room safe was temperamental to close. On the plus side, all the toiletries were replaced each day.  As a group, we had to take our breakfast in the bar/restaurant area rather than in the main breakfast room.  I therefore think we had a much smaller range of food available and most of the ""hot"" food was cold.  If you are planning on visiting the tourist attractions on the waterfront or the old part of the city, you would be far better advised to find a hotel around Tejo (there are plenty near Rossio and Figuera Squares which are similarly priced)."
4846,"Great location however hotel desperately needs to be upgraded. Carpets need to be replaced, walls need to be painted, bathrooms are old and staff needs to learn how to treat people. I agree with an earlier review about the smell, gross."
4847,"The hotel is a huge concrete impersonal edifice....everything we dislike about a hotel; however, on arrival, there was little we could do other than go with it. We had booked a suite, which when we arrived had been ill prepared, we had to ask for dressing gowns, slippers, water, coffee, so not a good start. Storage space for luggage was limited, it amounted to 2 drawers and a small hanging space. Had we wished to unpack our 2 suitcases, it would have been impossible. In search of dinner, we could not find a bar without blaring music, or a restaurant without music. In fact, music was piped throughout the whole hotel and was only escapable in our room. Breakfast the next morning was a buffet and was reasonable enough, however, the service was appalling, which we discussed with the…"
4848,"I stayed there 5 nights with my wife in February 2017.   In a nutshell: a cozy place, great quiet location (10 min walk to three different metro lines, 15 min walk to Sacre du Coeur, Molin Rouge, 20 min to Champs-Elysee, 30 min walk to Musee Pompidou and Musee D'Orsay etc, Carrefour City round the corner, plenty of nice places to eat nearby - check the map yourself), super clean, amazing bed and linen and towels, great polite and accommodating staff, good though a bit intrusive room service (result of absence of Don't disturb sign in the room I guess), nice buffet-type French breakfast - better than at most restaurants, complimentary evening tea and cakes, 24-h fruits plate.  But first and foremost, you feel you're staying at the very right, the very French place and not one of…"
4849,Cosmo is modern and tasteful. The staff is very nice. The breakfast very fine. The location good – very close to U-bahn-station Spittelmarkt and in walking distance to Museumsinsel and Alexanderplatz. It is luxurious and at the same time down-to-earth. 
4851,"This hotel was close to the tower in a great little neighborhood of Paris. Hotel offered all the standards and was clean, updated and a good value. There is an on-site restaurant, but I didn't try it or use the coffee bar in the lobby.  There are many restaurants within minutes of the hotel and several theaters up the street too. Will stay there again on my next visit."
4852,"Stayed with my wife for 3nights in May. The location was excellent just metres from the the arch de triumph giving us an easy landmark to locate our hotel. The staff were very good and professional. Our room was on the 4 th floor and facing away from the street so we had no noise at all. The room itself was a good size although the double bed were 2 singles joined together. There were a few English stations although we were generally to worn out to watch.The only noise was the occasional footsteps in the hallway. Breakfast was very good with scrambled eggs, bacon and a variety of fruits and sweets. The only down fall was the hot breakfast was not very hot unless you were there early, maybe something to keep it warm would make a difference. The view from the 7th floor resteraunt…"
4853,"I visit Berlin for 2 days trip and decided to stay at Sheraton Berlin even some of previous review comment on location.   Hotel not located in city  centre but yet still convenience with public transportations options, nearest bus station just 2 minutes away which I travel around city with public transportation easily.  For the room is very comfortable, clean, well maintained with fully equipment.  Very warm welcome reception during check in & out and helpful Conceirge. "
4855,"Accommodation was very good with the exception of the bed which would definitely stop us from staying here again. The location was perfect, car parking was great and overall staff were very good. We are disappointed as it was a very convenient place for us, however if we can't sleep......"
4856,"Within an easy walk from the train station (500 meters give/take or 15 minutes the first time with Google Maps), it’s a great location.  Also, it's a bit away from the touristy hustle-bustle of say St. Nicolaas Church and the hotels near it.  (I’m glad I didn’t book one of those.)  As a bonus, there is a tram stop very close by the Sint Nicolaas, though many sights (Dam Square, Anne Franke’s House) are within walking distance (the Van Gogh Museum is too, but we took the easy to use tram (buy tickets on board).  BTW, watch for speeding bicycles in all directions and at all times.  The triple room we had was spacious for families and the breakfast buffet had a good variety of choices.  Reception staff is nice and friendly, but one guy’s information was wrong (double check online,…"
4857,"We stayed in hotel Mundial for 5 nights. The first impressions were good, the reception and lobby looked very fine and neat. The hotelroom itself was a little dissapointing to what we expected – all the pictures we’d seen had quite big-looking rooms with wide, at least queen size beds. Our room was very small and had two separate beds which we pushed together. The closet couldn’t have even been opened otherwise because the bed was so close to it. (Although the reason we got a small room might’ve been because we got to the hotel very late at night around 10:30PM). The beds were quite comfortable, though. The bathroom was very nice and even had a bathtub and bathrobes. What also confused us was that there were ZERO free sockets in the room so we could charge our phones. We had to…"
4858,"Our trip last week to Paris was for the purpose of renewing our Australian passports. As we have been to Paris on numerous trips (we now live in France), we decided to stay somewhere closer to the Australian Embassy.  As we normally stay in the 1st to 6th arrondissements, a change to the 15th was a significant move.  Booking the hotel was no problem and we liked what we saw on the website. In reality, the hotel was exactly as described on the website and we were pleased to see that we received a free room upgrade on arrival.   The room was by Paris standards quite spacious and recently modernised, with a very good roomy bathroom and good bedding. A close view of the Eiffel Tower from our window also helped to set the scene.  Facilities were good with a good sitting area and…"
4859,"My room was immaculately clean, though I detected a faint tobacco odour in the air. My only complant is that there were no chairs with backs on which to sit and read, only an ottoman Though there was no safe in the room, the hotel's was secure and accessible at all hours. The desk staff was friendly and most obliging. Breakfast, buffet style, offered an enormous choice of food, the facility open 24/7 for the purchase of beverages and snacks or an entire meal at very reasonable prices. The location was excellent, a mere 4-5 minute walk from the stores and public transit at Alexanderplatz. Museum Island is about 15 minutes away by foot, and the Brandenburg Gate 30 minutes."
4860,This place did not accommodate us with just one KING bed that we asked for.  We had to stay in a double queen on our honeymoon. They charged us $30 something to park our car and they claimed that there is no parking and that's what all the hotels do. Then our car stayed out by our hotel for a while. THIS MESSAGE IS FOR THE PEOPLE OF MIAMI MAINLY. IF YOUR MAIN INCOME IS TOURIST THE YOU MIGHT WANT TO TREAT THEM BETTER. MY EXPERIENCE WAS LIKE BEING IN MYRTLE BEACH.  They charged us more at one of the strip restaurant then they said like we were stupid tourist and would understand.
4862,We needed a last minute place to stay in da nang after our plane was delayed for 5 hours. I found this place and although it was cheap and the staff were very polite there were many flaws. The hot water wasn't working our entire stay and their only explanation was maintenance and after a conversation on the phone to reception in very broken English I was just hung up on. There were geckos and cockroaches all through our room and bathroom and the Tv wasn't working. The beds were also incredibly hard and uncomfortable I'd probably have had a better sleep on the floor! 
4863,"Pros: Location, location, location  Cons: Sofa bed was a bit hard to set up and slightly worn  Location is fantastic and right across from the Boqueria Market and Metro station Liceu. Walking distance to Placa Catalunya (5-10 minutes) and Casa Batlo/Casa Mila (20 minutes).   Front desk is available 24 hours and was very friendly and happy to answer any questions we had.  We were a family of 3 adults and stayed in a studio. We found the room to be a bit tight as we had 2 large suitcases. Sofa bed was a bit hard to set up (2 cushions which formed the base of the bed detached as we were setting the bed up, and trying to re-attach them were a bit challenging) and a bit worn (minor tears in armrest). No other complaints about the room though.  Overall, we enjoyed staying at Apart 108…"
4864,"The Saint Jacques hotel is increasingly distinguished by the quality of services it offers. With its always helpful staff, I feel obliged to highlight the warmth of Mr. Areski, responsible for the evening hours and the manager Zeina who welcomes us with a warmth that makes us feel at home.  The reform in the rooms providing even more comfort, and especially in the toilets that is the suggestion of this modernity.  I congratulate the Board for all this improvement and organization and also for the brunch served for breakfast.  Follow on Instagran the best news from the hotel. CONGRATULATIONS MR. ROSSEAU."
4865,This hotel is more worried about the design than function. I have stayed in dozens of Hyatt hotels and never been so disappointed. The restaurant and bar are a joke and the service is terrible. My advise if you have to stay here is to  forget about the restaurant & bar. Go next door to the Peninsula.
4866,"When we first checked in we bonded with the gentlemen on the night desk.  They were charming and friendly and we had a great time joking with them and getting a dinner suggestion.  That, unfortunately, was the last good interaction we had.  The concierge kept trying to get us to go to the restaurants in the building.  Even to the point of not making a reservation at the place we wanted to go (fortunately one of the guys who was there when we checked in had a long animated conversation in Portuguese and we were able to get a reservation.)  The host at the free breakfast told us to go back to our room and order room service.  We left for a few minutes, discussed it, and then returned.  We were then told that it would be ""impossible"" to seat us.  There were several sections of…"
4867,"Not impressed. We’ve been in Vietnam for five weeks and stayed at eight different hotels and this hotel would rate the poorest. My major issue is the cleanliness of our room. We stayed here for six days and when our room was serviced they would only make the bed and change the towels, the floors remained dirty with sand left on them and we actually had to clean the toilet ourselves. Used drinking glasses were not replaced.  The safe in our room was not bolted down, it could have been picked up put in a suitcase and easily taken. We didn’t leave our valuables there. There were only three elevators and one was designated “staff only”, however the staff would regularly use the other two, why couldn’t we use the third one. Compared to other hotels in Vietnam, the staff here wasn’t…"
4868,booked all inclusive but with limited choices at meal times  and snacks limited to 2 hours a day.. drinks are free up to 2300 hours then you pay at the bar . their was no entertainment after 2100 hours .the room was clean and comfortable with sea view .the complex is on a steep hill need to be fit  more for the older person how want to sit by the pool and read books
4869,"Early in the morning on January 3rd (2am) there was apparently an altercation that started at a party in one of the guest rooms. The fight continued down in the lobby and out into the street where 3 people were shot in a ""gang-related incident.""  Talking with my friends I was in town to visit, this hotel is a blight on what is otherwise a wonderful neighborhood. The hotel bars attract a rough crowd from other sketchy Chicago neighborhoods who cause a lot of trouble late at night in the neighborhood.  The hotel needs to up its security- ensuring that only registered guests are in the rooms and clearing the riff raff out of it's bars."
4870,"It was not my first stay in Ibis Ostbahnhof, but it is always a pleasure to stay here! The room is like all IBIS rooms clena and functional, the shower is quite modern. The bed is nice. so it is as I expected! "
4871,"The fact that our room was not air conditioned was not mentioned to us and the availability of a fan was not mentioned either. As a result when we went to bed after midnight the lovely breeze that had prevailed all day was gone and replaced by suffocating heat in our room.  We got very little sleep and this in a room that cost 240 Euros. The management was not willing to make a concessions for our discomfort and did not even express dismay.  However, in every other regard this is a lovely hotel with a stupendous view and excellent dining.  The addition of a celing fan in each non-air conditioned room and a directive to staff to fully inform guests and ask if they'd like additional mobile fans would solve this problem."
4872,"Great location near park, U-Bahn, and S-Bahn! Friendly and helpful staff! Expensive breakfast, but glad to have it available. Had a room just over one of the entrances and near the staircase and elevator, so it could be loud. "
4873,I've found my 1 night stay excellent.  Have visited many hotels in Paris before and I can really endorse this one. The basics for a city trip are there and it looks recently remodeled.    The district is nice and the subway only 100m away. 
4875,We stayed at the hotel for four nights with a family of four. The hotel certainly meets all the standards to be expected from a Holiday Inn Express and is very conveniently located in the centre of Berlin with several main tourist locations within a 10-15 minute walk.
4876,"I really recommend this place: great location, clean, cozy and kind staff (specially Ines). For me was perfect, I would stay there again.  Recomendo: limpo, organizado e com uma equipe super atenciosa. Além da boa localização "
4877,"We booked our holiday through last minute.com and was our first holiday to Madeira. we chose the hotel out of the main hotel zone on the understanding of a free shuttle bus several times a day into town. we were very disappointed to find out this has been suspended indefinitely and therefore had considerable extra cost to the holiday for taxis. We tried to walk into town a few times but the road outside the hotel has no footpath and cars/bikes certainly don't hold back driving.  Although the rooms were pleasant, we did not feel this hotel had the services of a 5* hotel. The receptionist didn't offer information about bathrobes, tea making facilities, no shorts in the dining room, ability to eat at sister hotels. The food was good but only one meat or fish dish every night and we…"
4878,"it's a great location and has a nice rustic feel. But the 'superior' room we stayed in overlooked a road which hosted honking cars and Friday night drinkers until 6 am. At about 3 am, having given up on any chance of sleep (and I normally sleep easily), I took a trip downstairs to ask if there was any chance of moving. The hotelier's response was that the room has double glazing and the partying stops at 6 am anyway! What??? And I know they had other empty rooms!  Breakfast then started at 7 am. Our 'superior' room was conveniently located just above the breakfast room, so we endured the smell of burnt croissants, poor coffee and another 2 hours of noise, before giving up, eating said burnt croissants and checking out!"
4879,Hotel in a quiet area in Berlin within a reasonable distance to the fairground and other places in the central Berlin. Very good communications both by bus from the airport and S-Bahn/U-Bahn all over Berlin.  
4880,"The service, cleanliness and quality of the precises are as you would expect for a $80+ hotel. What makes me very angry about the hotel is that breakfast not only is not included, but is ridiculously expensive ($15+) and I had to pay $25 for a 40 minute call.The view from the rooftop is pretty, but the pool is underwhelming. There are many other options with much better value for your money."
4881,"First mistake it is in the Tenderloin area of San Fran so be prepared for dozens of homeless and drug addicts in close proximity to the Hotel. The Hotel is heritage listed but really needs a bulldozer, the place smells every where very musky, putting your head down on the sheets you think to yourself mmm.. I should really wash these sheets. The bath room is tiny, first night the soap dish sheared off the wall, two days later it disappeared completely from the room, open drain in the shower you could wedge your foot into also. Beds are stuffed, mattresses are old and worn out, bedding is tired and washed so many times it's shrunk and does not fit. Hall carpets have been vacuumed that many times they are stretched and a trip hazard for OH and S, the place looks like the set of…"
4882,Stayed there for business reasons for a good price. Entering the hotel you still feel a 5 star flair until you see the room. The rooms are very small with old furniture of the (early) 90's and look a bit grubby. Especially the carpet and the windows were dirty. Bathroom was clean and it was ok to sleep one night. It is absolutely ok for a short stay but I don't recommend this for a cosy couple holiday. Absolutely great in this hotel is the breakfast!
4883,The relexa is a well located hotel with good service. All the staff are excellent and while the foos options are limited the food is always good. Overall this is a good hotel for a business trip or short stay to see the city.
4884,"We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights on the end of a brilliant 10 week holiday travelling through Canada and the US.The hotel,amenities and location were acceptable.The sour note to our stay in this hotel is that on returning to Australia on checking our bank details I found that $123.27 had been deducted from our account even though I had paid our account in full by cash on our departure.I have sent an e-mail to this hotel asking for an explanation on this issue but have received no response.Further to this we had paid in advance for our accommodation as well as breakfast which included taxes and gratuities but still they tried to charge us again for these services whilst we were there which I thought had been resolved.As I said earlier after travelling around Canada and the US…"
4886,Concierge were rude & not the least friendly. I asked to go to Hyatt on the Bund & the cab driver took me to Park Hyatt instead because the concierge had told him the wrong hotel! We asked one other concierge to take a group picture of us. He simply walked away because he was busy. One of us had to walk back to the concierge desk to ask him again to take a pic for us.  Breakfast at the cafe was good but service was inconsistent.  The Italian restaurant was alsolutely terrible. They served us bad fish. They 'found' out that the fish wasn't properly stored when we complained. But they served it anyways?? We returned the fish obviously. There was only 3 tables max when we were dining but it took forever to get our food. And no one even bothered to check in us or let alone refill…
4887,"We arrived very early in the morning and were greeted by nice reception staff, who let us check in and get access to our room despite the early hour, which we appreciated very much. The room was nice and clean and in addition to the beds there was a desk, a couple of chairs, TV, electronic safe, mini-bar, however no tea and coffee making facilities. The beds and pillows were quite comfortable (only slightly harder than our preference) and there were duvets, which we liked (as we consider blankets too uncomfortable). Wifi worked well, connection was easy and the speed was sufficient although not the fastest connection we have experienced. The size of the room and bathroom was reasonable and sufficient, and so was the lighting. The wash basin in the bathroom had a small area where…"
4888,"For the price we paid to stay at this place, I expected to be able to relax and have a nice mini vacation. It was hardly that - it is right across the street from a fire station and the sirens went off all of the time. We were traveling with two children and the noise kept them up all night and day time naps were impossible.  The hotel offered ear plugs and a noise machine which was no help - first of all my kids didn't like the ear plugs - which 3 year old does?... and the machine did not drown out all the sirens that went off all night long. We were also able to hear all conversations and people in the hallway. It didn't help that our room was by the elevator. The lack of sleep from the noise made our weekend awful - and staff kind of just shrugged and said too bad. Wish we…"
4889,"If you're looking for an accomodation in Paris that is close to Gare du Nord train station (25 min walk), Metro Stop (3 min walk) and tourist attractions (10 min wlak) but is still within a reasonable price range - this place is perfect! We got a room on the 6th floor with a view to Montmartre. the room was very clean, cosy, bathroom was bigger than expected and very much spotless!"
4890,"Very good service, room and location. Within less than 20 minutes of walk you can reach the most of Berlin's ""must see"" attractions. Very good breakfasts, but the restaurant is located in other building than rooms.    "
4891,"The rooms are large and very clean. The bed and the pillows are very comfortable. The shower in the bathroom is amazing. The breakfast is one of the best I have ever had in hotel - variety of fresh juices, pancakes, croasants and a lot more things that i didn't manage to try, although I spent 4 days in the hotel.  My room was quiet although it was facing the street. There are many restaurants and shops nearby. The subway/metro station is around 300 meters away, so a good starting point for exploring Paris. "
4892,"We stayed here in May 2018 based on other reviews and left bitterly disappointed.    The reception staff were very sweet and attentive and deserve praise.  That’s where the service ended.   Not listed when we booked our room was that the window was into the air shaft. We could not see the sky.   Cleaning staff knocked on our door at 9am to get access to clean the room.  The breakfast buffet was the worst we’ve ever seen, looking dried out as it was left overs from the previous night’s dinner buffet. The dishes were not filled by staff.  The coffee was cold by 830, as the staff did not keep the burner under the coffee urn alight.   One morning I asked that it be refilled as it was nearing empty only to have the urn tipped on the side. The following morning at 830 when there was…"
4893,"My experience at this hotel was odd. The hotel itself was fine, although the bedrooms are a bit small and my view was of an alleyway. The bathroom was large and clean. The breakfast was fairly good.    However, he staff would be friendly one minute, and then flip on you and be rude or dismissive the next minute. I had several weird encounters with them in the four days I stayed there.   The safe in my room stopped working. I went to the front desk to tell them and they said they would take a look. I had to go out so I put all of my medicine in a bag and asked the front desk to put it in in their safe since my safe was not working. This medicine would be difficult and extremely expensive to replace, and my day to day health was dependent on it. I was at the beginning of a multi…"
4894,"The hotel has kind of a weird design but if you look beyond that, it is all good :)  We stayed on the first floor and were not bothered by the traffic outside.  The room was pretty small, and the layout of the bathroom/shower/sink was a little weird. You had to go outside the bathroom to wash your hands. However, the room was clean and the bed was nice so no complaints there :) Sheets were really great.  Breakfast was good, would recommend the toasted bagels with cream cheese, and fruit salad and juice. The coffee was awful though, pretty weak. Get double espressos from the machine :) Location is close to metro and buses, walking distance to all the touristy stuff you want to see :) All in all, I would definitely recommend this hotel."
4895,"Perfectly situated near the Trocadero, less than 10 minutes away from the Eiffel tower and near two metro stations (Boissieres and Trocadero line 6), this hotel is ideal for a Parisian vacation. It is also next to a police station, making this a very safe area and it has a laundromat just in front. We stayed there 4 nights and enjoyed our stay. I am not sure why people are complaining about the room size as our room was pretty big for European standards. It was actually almost twice as big as our room in Nice. The decor was modern and the bathroom was pretty big. The only issue that I would recommend is to allow the guests to regulate the AC temperature, we had to call the reception to turn it up and to fix the issue with the doors as no matter how hard we tried not to make a…"
4896,"Stayed here for 5 days, would not do it again. Overpriced, extremely difficult to communicate with anyone since their knowledge of English was surprisingly lacking. We've stayed at other Park Hyatt properties and this one was by far the most disappointing. Room is spacious, but don't expect great views, the smog is the worst I've ever seen, Pearl Tower was barely visible most days. Also, the room design is plain odd, and the rooms are dark, felt like a cave, even with all lights on. Bathroom was the only nice thing, other than dark, great shower and huge tub. But of all the things that could be better, WiFi was by far the most underwhelming, when it worked, which was very sporadically. When it did it was at speeds of less 1 Mbps, my 1995 modem was faster. And we tried it in our…"
4897,Looking forward to all that The Palace has to offer.  Upon arrival we were met with and had to walk through a barrage of Marriott workers on strike.  The noise echoed throughout the foyer and into the Garden Court making it impossible to enjoy.  Strikers are on from 7:00am - 10:00pm.    A courtesy call prior to arrival with instructions to enter off of the Jessie Street entrance would have been greatly appreciated.  Along with noise cancelling ear phone.
4898,"Spacious room for family of 3.  Comfortable beddings, clean.  Well appointed modern furnishings. Friendly, accommodating  staff. Very accessible.  20 minute walk to grocery stores, McDonald's,  restaurants.  There is a nice cafe for very reasonably priced breakfast 5 minute walk away."
4899,"Staff was very courteous, helpful and attentive. Hotel is in a very convenient location; just a few minutes walk to and from the Saint-Lazare train station. Our room was quiet and perfect for my wife and I."
4900,"Beautiful hotel, lovely service nothing too much trouble. Great location!   If you stay here you MUST upgrade to a room with a view of the dome! Our room and view was beautiful and looked amazing at night time!"
4901,"Stayed for a week, has potential to be a great place, but as it is now, I would not recommend it.  The room was nice with good views and staff were friendly and helpful but negatives definitely outweigh the positives. -Breakfast is not very good -the coffee is terrible (whether it be Vietnamese, from the machine or the plunger). One morning, I think they put saltwater in the coffee machine, something definitely didn’t taste right  -we had ants in our room (but problem was rectified when we told the staff) - in the dining area, we noticed a lot of cobwebs with dead insects in wall and ceiling corners  - there are 3 restaurants on site. 1. The Kitchen, is where we had breakfast in the mornings and they do a buffet for dinner in the evening, convenience was what kept us going back.…"
4902,"We booked our room well ahead of time through a booking service selected from Tripadvisor's menu. When we checked in we were allocated a very small, charmless room, with two twin beds. We noticed that the price we had paid was far more than the hotel was charging for this room and that we received none of the complimentary welcome items that tripadvisor reviewers had all mentioned. We  we called to request some clarification, we were informed that since we booked through a second party and not directly with the hotel, they would offer us no accommodation, no upgrade, nada. In essence they penalized us for booking through tripadvisor's recommended second party booking agents. We travel 4+ months a year and found this treatment quite discouraging. The hotel is lovely and well…"
4903,"The hotel was amazing we had a grate stay there. I found the staff to be grate, they where willing to help in any way possible. The rooms where just right. The fact they offer free wifi is a gift it helped a lot for planning days out. The location is grate, the metro was a two min walk away, only six short easy stops to Central Parsi. I would recommend Fred to anyone; family's or couples. Happy days."
4904,"Lisbon has always been a city of pensaos and cheap accommodation with questionable standards, given the evolution of the modern hospitality industry.  Squeezed into the city centre with no integral amenities.  I still remember staying in a pensao where the owner would sell you beer from his living room fridge!  Given this, I was looking for a hotel with very good standards that wouldn't break the bank, slightly out of the very centre but a walk away, with parking, and that would be a nice place to get back to after a long day of sightseeing.  And....The Ibis Lisboa Saldanha did not disappoint!  Location: the location is a very residential part of town.  However, this means there are some typical shops - pastelaria, supermarket - but not really any bars or restaurants.  There are…"
4905,"The place is very clean and great staff, providing all information you need with all attention possible and the building itself is very nice, good internet connection. Great stay overall that was a lot cheaper than a hotel but just as good!"
4906,"I have visited twice now and would again.   Situated in what feels like a very real area of Paris, with excellent cafes, bars and boulangeries just around the corner. We even managed to park our car with trailer on the street for the duration of our stay.   Thanks to the staff who accommodated our bikes in their courtyard (the first time, there were thirty of us, the second time just four).   There's a Metro at the end of the street (150 metres away) and you can walk to Eiffel Tower, which is around two miles and Paris is pretty flat!   Beds are comfy, prices are reasonable. En suites are decent and our rooms came with traditional, tall French windows, which adds a huge amount to the experience."
4907,"Convenient location; good quality of buffet breakfast; room is dark; the bathroom design is not proper, water will leak out tremendously even you close the bathroom door.  Construction site is just next to the hotel, which mean you have to close the curtain at day time in order to have some privacy.  Hotel charged my credit card 2 weeks after I left.  When I followed up with them, they claimed its for my airport transfer and sent me the invoice.  They did not even check my check-out bill that two round trip transfers have already been charged upon check out.  I have to resend my check-out bill to clarify.  The additional charges on the transfer is more expensive than the previous agreed price.  After back and forth email exchange, they said they will refund back to my credit…"
4910,"the hotel is in a  perfect setting for getting around Barcelona, and the staff are very helpful, and full of good advice, sadly though it was a little noisy because of the traffic, the rooms are very clean and tidy, and there is Tea and Coffee available"
4911,"This property was once the gem of the Chicago Hotel scene but no longer.  While in the midst of an alleged upgrade one would expect service to be on point but I didn’t experience that - the bathroom was not perfectly clean, bathrobes have been removed, and complementary water was sparse.  I’m done with this location and despite the distance will transition to the Lakeshore property."
4912,"Just about a month prior to my arrival into Asteras Villas, I started to have some email communications with Ifogenia (the hotel receptionist) and have her arrange the car rentals during my stay. During the process of communication, she responds to my email very promptly! Thank you so much for her help. (If I am staying in Mandarin Oriental or Ritz Carlton, an immediate response from the reception is typically a must in my opinion, but to a smaller scale of hotel like this one I am totally amazed by how fast she responds to my inquiries - Normally responds within an hour). The hotel location is conveniently located in the Fira area and is only about 2-3 mins downhill walk to the bus stop which can take you to all over the island.   The second plus is that upon your arrival,…"
4913,"Good: The hotel lobby is quite nice. You feel very comfortable right from the check-in.  This includes the check-in process ... friendly, fast and professional. I liked that a lot.  The breakfast is also really ok ... not top ... but 100% sufficient.  Negative: The rooms are freezing cold and the heating was not working. I suggest to consider that foreigners might have a different feeling to temperatures than Latvians.  The TV did not work at all and the room Wi-Fi was extremely complicated. I stay more than 100 nights in hotels every year and this WiFi setup was extremely strange for me. When I asked for alcohol free beer over the room service the waitress was obviously annoyed about my exotic wish and just hang up the phone.  So ... yes I expected more from a Pullman in Riga. "
4914,"Spent one night in this hotel and checked out early in the morning although we booked for two nights initially. Family room smelled so bad (don't want to speculate but no other hotelroom ever smelled this way). Horrible sofabed (couldn't get our dog to sleep on it, if I had to). Very noisy, bad neighbourhood. The only positive I can think of is the Hotel staff. They were friendly and correct."
4915,"We were very impressed with the reception and the service - and the relaxed atmosphere as a consequence thereof.   Lovely decor and great style.  The Beach at the Croisette is only 3 or 4 minutes walk away, and you pass by the best shops in Cannes, directly on the Rue d'Antibes."
4916,"My husband and I  had a very shocking experience and we were more than disappointed. We happily paid >$350 for a room and we intended to stay for 3 nights for our  wedding anniversary.  On arrival the room we were checked into has no bath top, just shower, no drawer to keep any of our belongings for 3 days, no decent blind on the window and the carpet was very old.  The ward rope could barely take more than a couple of dresses.  We went to customer service to see if they could relocate us to a better room with at least a bath top.  The staff at the desk was very rude, could care less and says you got what you booked.  Attempt to discuss with her was fruitless and she was not concerned at all or in any mode to be of any help.  We said we may have to look for another hotel as we…"
4918,"There are a lot of things they really need to improve.  ● the WIFI is slow. ( My mobile, my partner's laptop both were slow) ● the CROSS HEAD taps are big problem, the right side direction is wrong. ● hot water is unstable... can you imagine that I was having a shower and the hot water suddenly became cold and then I want to turn the tap but the direction of the tap rotation is wrong.... almost disaster. ● There is a shelf above the sink so I can't bend myself to wash my face because my head will hit the shelf. If I move back to avoid the hit, the water will splash everywhere....  The advantages: ● new, modern and clean ● the location is good, the train just in front of hotel. Taking the free train to city just take you 10 more min. ● very quiet.  ● Staffs are nice and friendly.…"
4919,"Excellent, welcoming staff in the main but was not impressed with the reception area of the Mirimar and we felt some training may benefit the staff and customers alike.  Also, we was disappointed that although we was given a bottle of bubbly as a birthday gift by the hotel on enquiring we was told after staff checking with what appeared to be a senior manager that we was not allowed to consume it with our meal in their restaurant, so we gave it back to a very deserving member of staff as our gift to her.  On one of our breakfast visits there was a shortage of cups for tea and coffee and this situation appeared prolonged causing disappointment to a number of people.  On our departure day, we had to have an early start and there appeared to be a number of stairs areas where light…"
4920,Room & bathroom were large enough for 3 people.  Breakfast was tasty.  Staff super helpful.  Bed was very comfortable.  Easy access to the garden and transportation.  Within walking distance of bars & restaurants.
4921,"We were booked in here by the “Place in the Sun” tv programme for 5 days of filming. It was a lovely hotel in a lovely area. Just a short walk from the Carlton on the Croisette. The bedroom was clean and very comfortable with wide screen TV , nice bathroom and great air conditioning! A small breakfast room with “help yourself “ croissants, fruit, cereal, scrambled eggs, beans toast etc and plenty of coffee tea, and juices. A great start to a long hot day. The staff are so helpful and friendly and not forgetting the warm welcome of Nesquik, the hotels lovely docile dog!  We highly recommend this Bijou hotel."
4922,"Staff were the highlight of this place. They were kind and considerate, always had time to talk and get us a taxi if we needed it. The room was clean and comfortable, brilliant size given we had asked for a superior suite. Even a nespresso machine which was a lovely touch! Gorgeous bathroom, lovely lounge, and we loved the Montparnasse neighbourhood. Very bohemian! Easy access to the metro, plenty of places to eat. We loved it. Would definitely go back!"
4923,Staff are helpful. We were allowed to check in half an hour earlier. Quiet location with main train station to Vasaillies and Bordeaux within 5 minutes walk. Breakfast is great.The room is rather small for a family of four.
4924,"Like an English B&B, not a hotel. Must register in one building, then let yourself in with key in next building. Hallways completely unheated in 30 degree weather. On the bright side, staff is pleasant and it is clean. We were totally mis-led by the ratings on TripAdvisor. At best a '2'."
4926,"We were very fortunate to find Villa Claudia after the first place booked for a nights stay in Cannes was a disaster. Our host Christoph made us feel very welcome. Lovely, clean room with air con too. Plenty of parking for cars and its a short walk in to the centre of Cannes. Well worth a visit."
4930,"It was a nice hotel to stay for a few days, but the location was a problem. Nevertheless, their service was perfect, so there's no problem about."
4931,"Stayed at this property for 4 nights. Got off to a bad start when the taxi driver told me that he cannot drive to the front of the hotel because it is blocked off by police because it is too close to the parliament. Had to drag my suitcase to the hotel across the square.  Hotel is officially a 5*. Primarily targeted at business travellers.   (a) No desks in the rooms. Apparently the decor team convinced the owner of the property that in today’s world, business travellers don’t use desks but work on the bed with their laptops. A desk can be requested!  (b) No ironing board or iron.  (c) Rooms have “Smart TVs” where you hook into the WIFI on a room-by-room basis. We tried two rooms, when the TV is switched off, the internet stops working. Very smart.  (d) Asked for a toothbrush…"
4932,"This place is an easy walk from the Opera bus station, meaning it’s easily accessible from CDG. We were 3 people staying in the Deluxe room. The living quarters were spacious and well configured. The bedding was memorably comfortable with the only fault being a creeky bathroom door.  We’d arrived into Paris on a 6am flight so in reaching the hotel very early the management were most helpful in trying to facilitate an early check in. While waiting in the business lounge they provided us coffee and orange juice.  The in-house cafe is very expensive but as with everywhere in Paris, a patisserie is never far away. Across the road there is a park with a small children’s playground and next door there’s a bar that attracts a sensible crowd (we weren’t disturbed by any rowdy behavior).…"
4933,"I stayed at the Hilton Río de Janeiro Copacabana as it is a preferred hotel for my company, so I will probably end up staying here again.   I am a seasoned business traveler and having stayed at many hotel chains before, I share some examples here of why I think this hotel should not call itself a Hilton:  - I arrived shortly after 3am following a 20hr trip. It took the receptionist more than 20 min to give me a room cause “they were updating their system”  - the first day, I came back to my room after 6pm and the room had not been cleaned. I had to call housekeeping to make sure they cleaned it.   - I ordered room service on the second night. The grilled salmon was grossly over cooked. Instead of the glass of wine I had ordered they brought a small bottle of champagne. A very…"
4934,"This hotel is in a good location just a few minutes walk from the centre of Cannes which offers a huge selection of restaurants and bars. The room was spacious, super comfortable and tastefully decorated. Breakfast was continental style with plenty of choice including meats, cheeses and pastries - would recommend this hotel."
4935,I lost my Ray Bans and they were very unhelpful in helping me find them. They just didn't care. I'm sure I lost it in Market Place when I placed them down to pay for $5 for cup of coffee .  You have to rent a car to go anywhere. Otherwise it's $100 for a taxi to go ANyWHERE! They don't coordinate or offer shuttles. It's rent a car or gat a taxi for $100. Then pay for parking! No other option!
4936,"The place is very beautiful and the front desk very friendly they accommodated special request and were very open to any request. The size of the suite is comfortable and the decoration luxurious and welcoming, I hope I can book this suites next time I travel to Paris, my stay was very pleasant and my family enjoy the place very much."
4937,"I was snookered by the website and photos. The hotel is not what is seems. Its located in Palermo, which is nice, but the hotel needs a lot of work. The rooms are nice enough, modern, and I chose the suite, but its not suited for business travel. There wasn't even a pen/paper in the room, or a card to tell me how to dial out. It's also near the train tracks, so its noisy. The staff is nice, but every time you leave the hotel, they lock the front door, which i found strange, especially when you return and have to wait for them to unlock it.  We checked out after 3 nights..."
4938,"The worst Internet of any major hotel,in South America and terrible food. Staff was very helpful, unfortunately it was always in response to poor quality food or some other misstep by the hotel. It's like a fine car firing on 3 cylinders."
4939,"perfect location, superconfortable bed, very clean. The apartment was nicely decorated. It was a pity for the broken elevator, the fact that the reception had not very long hours and the stairs that were a bit dark. Nontheless Bernhard was always available via email and they were very well organized in leaving the keys and everything. Recommended!"
4940,I was excited to stay at the intercontinental but from the start to the end it was horrible. Don't waste your money. I was happy to leave because nothing went right. Please go someplace else they try but fail . 
4941,"Arrived late.   Would not give my wife a room with one bed -  so we would sleep apart for the first time in double beds.   Off to a bad start - the bonus was what appeared to be human fluids on the sitting chair and a separate quarter sized stain on the sheets.  Went to see the manager, but she was completely unapologetic.  She sent housecleaning to our room at 11pm to scour the chair while my wife and I watched.  Truly dreadful.  Stuck here for conference. All that said, people beyond the night shift front desk staff are quite charming.  "
4943,"The hotel has a good location, the rooms are OK, the breakfast buffet is good (for example bettern than the one from the Pullman hotel which is also quite close). Some upkeep needs to be done as there are elevator buttons that aren't working, in my last room the blinds had some holes. Nothing major at the moment, but still already visible. The biggest minus is the ""gym"". A couple of years ago the gym was at the top floor next to the pool, but right now it is in a tiny room in the basement. There isn't much equipment (two treadmills, a bicycle, a contraption for weightworks and some weights), and the existing one is outdated and makes scary noises when used with a higher intensity. Amusingly there are also boxing gloves, but no punchbag. There are no paper towels to clean the…"
4944,"I expected a lot more from a five star hotel. My husband and I stayed here on our last two nights in Buenos Aires. We had previously stayed at Casa Calma boutique hotel just a few feet away but wanted something more luxurious to celebrate our anniversary. Big mistake. The pool only has three lounge chairs- that’s it- and three chairs for a hotel with fifteen floors. Each time we went they were busy. The sauna was wonderful until I came out and there were two naked men standing in the shared resting area . The sauna is separated for women and men and there are signs that clearly state “women only” but no signs that warn that the resting area is for both. When I complained the attendant told me that it had happened before. So, they are aware but haven’t done anything about it?…"
4945,"Worst experience ever. After driving 13 hours to vacation with our 2 daughters we went to check in to our room we'd booked and paid in full for 3 months ago. Front desk clerk prints a piece of paper and says how would you like to pay for the remaining $150 balance. I informed him we'd already paid in full and shouldn't have a balance. He then said "" well in the fine print of your contract you will find that we charge $25 per night for rooms holding more than 2 guests. We booked a queen suite for 4 guests. I even spoke to the front desk when we booked to make sure the room would accommodate both of our children. To find out I'm being charged an addition fee for my children after I'd already paid for the room is beyond ridiculous. Be warned if you have more than 2 people in your…"
4946,"Good looking cation, very modern rooms. But bed very hard and uncomfortable.My room had some kind of weird irregular motor like noise and was very noisy.Overall little rest and disappointing experience."
4947,"We stayed in April as part of a secret escapes deal. The staff were charming and attentive and the lobby is lovely. It's very rare that you genuinely feel comfortable to loiter and read a paper in a hotel lobby area, but it really feels welcoming and comfortable. Our room was great, not the level of obvious luxury you get in a British 5*, but typical German functionality with hints of the 5* rating. No bath, which I know is common for mainland Europe, but I much prefer to have a bath in a hotel room. The Turkish Hammam is very nice. Fantastic restaurant, both breakfast and dinner were brilliant. Brilliant location for enjoying all of Berlin's amazing sights and attractions. The concierge was very helpful for making dinner reservations. A fantastic holiday."
4948,"I had booked a double room just for myself and it turned out to be a 3 bed room. The check in took quite long, people were friendly but procedure took long.  The room was clean but very basic.  There are better hotel/hostels for that money in Berlin."
4949,"After reading so many positive comments, my husband and I decided to stay at Grand Kempinski Shanghai as our last hotel experience before moving out of China tomorrow. I booked two nights, starting from yesterday. Now we are checking out today and staying somewhere else tonight. Why? Among all executive floors we have stayed, this hotel has the least value.  Room Type: Executive King City View  Pro: Reasonable Price  Con: 1. No separate check-in for Executive Floor 2. Upon check-in the receptionist did not explain Club floor benefits; did not let us know we could enjoy late check-out till 16:00; did not even ask our newspaper preference. 3. I specifically asked for high floor and quite room through Booking.com. The receptionist did not say anything. It turned out the room we got…"
4950,"We were in Amsterdam for a few days before continuing our trip. We had our car with us so this hotel was good for us. Parking was in the building just behind the hotel, very close. The sign is very small at the parking entrance so we missed it the first time.  The hotel is quite good and is a 3 star hotel. That seems ok in my opinion. Cleaning is below expectations. The hallway was not cleaned while we were there. The same empty sugar cane wrapping was lying on the floor for 3 mornings. Our room was not the cleanest I have seen but we survived without any trouble. I guess that is also a part of the 3 stars. Reception area is nice and big with 24 hour service. The reception staff is efficient and helpful.  Breakfast is very good. There is something for everyone. For us the…"
4951,"This hotel seems to be in transition.  I just don't know if its improving or deteriorating.  Some things were comfortable and clean, the bed for example was great.  With a little bit of work, this could be a top notch hotel.  However, besides some peeling wallpaper and chipped paint in the hallways, the worst element by far are the showers.  The bathroom floor in particular are these porous tiles that capture dirt in little crevices.  This means that in order to clean them, they must be scrubbed with a good abrasive cleanser.  This is not happening.  The shower tiles have moldy grout and look like they have NEVER been scrubbed.  I verified this on two occasions when I watched housekeeping clean my room.  They don't touch the shower.  The cleaning consists of changing linens and…"
4952,"This hotel was great for only a 2.5 star rating, the room was clean, great breakfast offered included in the price of the room and very close to the train and Alexander Platz would definitely stay here again.  "
4953,"I really wanted this to be a good review as I had high expectations but unfortunately I had a disappointing stay at this hotel. First the good stuff, it's in a great location, it's clean and the prices are reasonable as they have just opened so have many offers currently. However my experience wasn't great and I rarely give negative reviews in accommodation. I booked this hotel in advance before travelling to Vietnam basing it on one review but it had newly opened so I thought I would take the gamble. I booked 5 nights and booked a deluxe ocean view with balcony/terrace stated on Agoda.com. Whilst away I had checked a couple of websites that didn't state balcony/terrace so I emailed the hotel direct to double check as this was the only reason I had booked. They replied stating…"
4954,Stayed here for 7 nights with my sister. This is was our first time in Madeira.  Upon arrival at the hotel our room wasn’t ready. We had to wait 50mins and then wasn’t told our room was ready until I asked. Some reception staff are friendlier than others. Our room was difficult to find but after going into 2 different sets of lifts we found it at the back of the hotel.  We stayed on a B&B basis. The room was a good size well equipped with a small kitchenette. The balcony was ridiculously small. A table and 2 chairs and no room for us! The bathroom was a good size and well equipped. However this is where my concerns that this isn’t a 4* place come in. The mirror has rust spots. The shower flops about at will. There is a considerable amount of mould on the shower screen and grout…
4955,"This hotel is in a great location, and staff was very nice. The rooms are small, but we didn't spend any time in the room anyway. This hotel is conveniently located close to the metro station and the Arc de Triumph. We loved it and would definitely stay there again."
4956,The wood floors had holes in them. The door required muscle to push it open. The bed was on rollers. All night u could here the upstairs people walking. The sink was stopped up. Couldn't sleep. The place is a dump. whatever you don't book the garden view room horrible. The drinks were overpriced and watered down in the bar. The you charge you $9 for services you don't use (PER DAY). Took 30minutes to get car from valet.
4957,There is no business center at the hotel and in a cold and snow weather; you have to walk outside to the next hotel that you can use their business center (Not convenient). The lightening in room is terrible & waitresses could benefit from customer service training.
4959,Make sure to check and see if the building construction is going on next door.  It is loud and unpleasant.  Very expensive for what it is.  No complimentary coffee. Front desk not always helpful. Refused to make a local call for me. Good location on river.
4960,I visited Z bar last evening and I had a such bad experience with the gentleman behind the bar ( bar tender). He did not represent the company and was not helpful nor engaging at all! We had to ask for the nuts and olives which should have been served with our beverage. Mind you all the guests next to us received theirs within few minutes of sitting. Then the ordering was a bit awkward as the bar tender seemed not interested in our orders at all.. to make the matter worse when I asked for our bill he totally ignored me and the lady far behind the bar had to tell him that we wanted our bill!! This is not 5 stars service and can not even anywhere near Forbes stards!! Very disappointed!
4961,"Stopped in a one bedroom apartment room was ok and clean .You would expect stopping in a 5 star you would get complementary water but instead cost 5 euros a bottle ,hotel grounds nice and very quiet ,The hotel as a shuttle bus in to the town which is 10 minutes away .after 7 o'clock they charge for the shuttle, Drinks and food are very expensive in the hotel which is normal calling your self a 5 star hotel, The service at front desk was great but in the restaurant and bar very poor my friends were waiting to be seated which never happened as the staff member  was playing on mobile phone, which was rude and he sat down his self, Our party agreed this was not a 5 star hotel not worth the 5 star money you pay"
4962,Stayed here thanks to an airline voucher after delayed flight led to missed connection.  Hotel advertises “airport” but waited 53 minutes for a shuttle after I called and was told it had just left. I was then told that it takes awhile to get to the airport with traffic. It was 1:35AM Saturday morning. Imagine if there actually was traffic. 
4963,"I stayed here 10 years ago and was looking forward to the experience again. Man have things changed!! The website indicates that the suites are newly renovated and the images are lovely. In reality, our room was dingy, tired and needed renovating. The door to the suite oozed a weird kind of sap that looked like blood against the white paint (a religious relic perhaps?) There were non functional electric plugs and light fixtures. The white curtains had dirty fingerprints on them and were broken. The bathroom sink faucets were loosely attached to the counter as were those in the kitchenette. Additionally, I booked a king room and they only had a queen for our stay. Oh yes and when you mentioned any of these things to the front desk, they actually knew about them??  I get that when…"
4964,"We liked Sana Berlin very much and stayed there for 5 nights, we would have rated it excellent if there would not have been smoke smell constantly in our room. It is ruining really great experience if no-smoker wakes up during night or early in the morning because there is heavy smoke smell in the room. Never experienced something that before.  Room, pool, saunas all are so good to have after exhausting day trip in the city. Pool is small but enjoyed it every morning and evening. We had 1 bedroom apartment and it was well equipped. Only thing that was missing was kitchen towels, would have appreciated to have these."
4965,"The hotel is very charming and Parisian. Theme of this hotel is literature of Victor Hugo. Location is near the center, about 20 min walking distance to Montmartre, and arc de triumph, opera. It’s also walking distance to Station Gare du Nord.  Many bus and metro stations nearby, and everything is very accessible. The stay is very comfortable. Concierge staff is very friendly and attentive. Highly recommend!! "
4966,"The structure itself it's nice, room big and personnel very kind. Unfortunately all the facilities seller on Agoda are just fake. The swimming pool at the second floor has no trees, no shadow, no bar. We are talking at a 5 stars hotel!!! Spa? Not ready yet. Beach? About 1km away. We called the reception but they say ""sorry, we know"" but the French manager said the price it's already 50% compare the regular price. We left for a much better solution which cost much less. We'll never get back there"
4967,We booked the hotel over a third party booking platform as bundle with a flight very cheap and therefore didn't expect much. We were blown away when we discovered this hotel. The styling is incredible and well thought out. The breakfast room can be described as cosy but the variety of breakfast options is rather rare. Would definitely go here again!!
4968,"Great apartment, clean and tasteful. There's even a washing machine. Only small problem is lack of staff. Nice small room downstairs with breakfast fixtures, small staircase (problem for strollers). All in all a very good solution for families"
4969,"This smaller boutique type hotel is my first experience within the H10 chain, it was a great introduction and I would not hesitate to book with them again. We arrived very early so we weren't able to check in but after a long day of touring, we came back to a clean modern room with our luggage placed securely, a large inviting shower in a well appointed  bathroom, and a very comfortable bed. We had a lovely patio which overlooked Gaudi's  illuminated La Pedrera, what a sight! This alone was worth the price of the room. Location of Casa Mimosa is definitely a strong selling point, we were able to walk to La Sagrada Familia with little difficulty. There are many restaurants in the area from fine dining to lighter fare.  I do agree with a previous reviewer who pointed out that…"
4970,I have requested via email and their website for a replacement receipt 3 times since May with no response!  This is clearly not a customer oriented type of hotel.  Location and room was very nice and convenient.
4972,Visited here for a few nights at the start of our organised India tour. Hotel looks nice from the lobby but the washrooms were not as clean as they should be. WiFi is chargeable and the staff were not not helpful or friendly. Room was ancient and dirty and when I told staff about the dirty room they didn’t care or do anything about it. I ended up cleaning the room myself and the photo was taken from wii g the headboard.  Breakfast was a good selection. Hotel is certainly not 4 star it make scrape a 3 star rating.
4973,"Booked this hotel for one night after leaving Key West before our flight out of Ft Lauderdale. Reviews lead me to Eden Rock. Figured for $179/night it was going to be an ok hotel. I wasn’t expecting 5 stars at that price. I was expecting a clean, quiet hotel to lay my head before my flight home. TripAdvisor states 4.5 stars. We travel a lot and TripAdvisor has never done us wrong. I was soooo wrong. This is a 2 star hotel at best. I will start with the only positives we experienced in 24 hrs. Check in was easy and pool area and beach areas are nice.  Sand was beautiful and pools looked nice. That is it. Everything else was a bad experience.   Do not stay here. Our room was dated and dirty. Carpet in hallways and in room was covered in lint and hair. Is it that hard to vacuum?…"
4974,"Another great Ibis hotel.  Rooms are peaceful, modern, clean and a little bit arty.  Hotel has both English and German speaking staff and they were all exceptional.  Staff assisted with directions and transport booking.  Buffet breakfast was excellent and the café area turns into a self-servery after meal times.  Location is perfect, walking distance to many many things.  Check out the Turkish run restaurant across the road for massive cheap meals (directly out of hotel entrance) or turn left out of the hotel to have some Russian meals.  A taxi to Berlin HBF was around 10minutes and barely as many euros. A taxi from TXL was about 25mins and about 20 euros. You can have a lovely affordable stay here.  Thanks Ibis styles"
4975,"As others have also posted, I was a little cautious as the reviews seemed to good to be true.  The reviews are accurate and we will stay there again.  Very, very courteous staff.  It was a very nice touch to have the afternoon snacks and the room refrig restocked each night.  There is also a laundromat a little over a block away.  "
4976,"We are staying in this hotel as I write with 4 days left in our vacation.  We received this hotel as a trade from the Marriott timeshare owner program on another property we have in Boston.  I have stayed at Days Inns with nicer accommodations than this with more amenities.  Location is great as many other reviews have noted and so is the beach.  And that is it!  Staff is very nice but the locals are wonderful to everyone, so I feel bad writing a poor review.  Steve Case (AOL founder) owns about a 1/3rd of the land here in Kauai and the download speeds in the hotel make 1985 look fast by comparison.  Impossible to do anything remotely like business from room or anywhere on property WiFi.  I had to go to beach for T-mobile signal to get excellent coverage 15mb downloads, in my…"
4977,The staff were brilliant in organising the room with the rose petals and fruit I paid for but only bad point would be the quality of pillows they were abit hard and too small so bigger and softer pillows are needed but saying that I still sleep fine
4978,older hotel rebranded as Mercure  - rooms are on the small side but overall not a bad experience - small bar on the premises and the buffet breakfast is adequate if not very exciting. convenient to public transport
4979,"Fantastic location, close to everything! Nice, clean, cozy room! They also provide you with beach mat. Staff friendly and willing to give you advice. We will definitely go back and suggested it to friends that wants to travel low cost!  What I love the most? Fresh and clean bedsheets... After a long day in the sun we had a glorious night in the fresh linen. See you soon "
4980,"There is no reception, and the entrance is by a kind of lock that is difficult to operate. There is no elevator, all the rooms are upstairs, and the stairs are very narrow. The communication with the staff is by phone, and there is not always a response."
4981,"Stayed for 4 nights. Room was spotless, staff generally friendly and helpful. Well located for Franfurter Allee S and U Bahn stations, which was on a direct line from Schonefeld Airport and a few minutes from Alexanderplatz with connections to most of Berlin.  Not a great deal of nightlife, bars etc. around the hotel, but we would recommend the Italian restaurant (Il Mondo) at the end of the road.  Reasonably priced when you take into account breakfast included, and the breakfast was pretty good.  Sauna area was a nice touch, but there is a €5 charge."
4983,"A few steps from the main railway station (Berlin hbf), which has plenty of shops and eating places, or the trams, and only a 15-20 walk to the Reichstag and Brandenburg gate.   Room 422. Very nice. Two beds pushed together with separate duvets. Mini bar, coffee machine and a kettle, with an assortment of teas.  Glass doors on bathroom and toilet might be an issue for some.  Weak WiFi in the room, ok if you sit in the hotel lobby or surprisingly in the toilet in the room."
4984,"Over the past several years,  we have stayed multiple times at the Intercontinental. The initial draw, several years back, was the convenience of the location. We make an annual trip to Chicago to do our Christmas shopping. This year after checking in, it was immediately apparent that something was off. I arrived early in the day (approx 10:30) and the room wasn’t ready,  so ran to the grocery store for a few in room snacks. Once back I checked the two bags but had a small bottle of sugarless coffee creamer that I needed stored. Bell services does not have a refrigerator. I went to the Concierge desk to inquire. The woman i engaged with there has absolutely no business working in the hospitality industry, let alone concierge. She was an older woman with short light colored hair.…"
4985,"N52°30'29.0"" E13°24'19.1"" Berlin's room rates might be low compared with other European capitals, but they do not include breakfast and free Wi-Fi Internet. Breakfast in Berlin cost easily € 18 per person per night. Grimm's is an exception in Berlin's Stadtmitte including breakfast for less than € 100 a night. Grimm's was adamant not to offer any discount for early and direct booking. There is probably no margin left in low Berlin room rates. Wi-Fi costs € 2 per hour in the room and is free in the lobby. The room doesn't have a fridge or water cooker. So enjoy the flat-screen television without thee or coffee.  The Grimm's hotel was built in 2009 on the Eastern site of the former ""Mauer"". The ""Mauer"" stood in front of the hotel. Find a line of stones and a plaque in the street…"
4986,"My husband and I spent 4 nights in early September in Paris at this lovely and quaint hotel. We typically stay in Air BNB's but thought it would be worthwhile to stay in a hotel to ease navigating Paris. It turned out to be a great choice. We had a deluxe room on the 4th floor.  Though it was a bit small, the bed was extremely comfortable, the French windows opened to a nice garden area and the location in the Spanish quarter was central, but quiet. Also as an added comfort, coffee and tea were provided in the room, which I don't believe is typical in a Paris hotel. We enjoyed the proximity to the Luxembourg Gardens, many restaurants and the metro and buses.  The staff at the front desk and the restaurant went out of their way to be helpful and made getting around Paris simple. …"
4987,"Hotel is a bit far from city center, but right on the water. Location is beautiful. Rooms right on the water. Great if you enjoy going for long runs. It's also close to a number of museums. However it is also right by the train tracks and so it was quite noisy. So try to ask for a room further down from the main street.   Room is comfortable but a bit outdated. The rooms need to be refurbished. Sofas and curtains stained.   Service at the front desk was impeccable though. Everyone was extremely attentive and friendly.   House keeping was a bit inconsistent. Many times they would leave dirty coffee cups or not hang towels.   All in all it was a good but average stay."
4988,"Stayed three nights at this huge hotel. It’s location is a two minute walk from the train station, so easy to get to. Check in was easy and staff were polite. Was given a lower floor upon request as I didn’t want floor 20 ( of 37 floors). Room was small but comfortable. Walk in shower and toilet was frosted glass and both visible. A curtain can be drawn across for privacy. We jokingly called the room a caravan! Bar and restaurant very pricey so we only had a few beers. That wasn’t a problem as we were literally a stones throw from anywhere and there are lots of bars, cafes and restaurants. Generally speaking away from the hotel, food and drinks are reasonably priced which was great considering you are in a capital. Some buts regarding hotel. Not enough pillows ( asked for more,…"
4989,"We have spent 7 nights there. The first night was terrible with lots of Mosquitos, then the next morning we asked the reception if they got something. Their answer was : nothing , nothing! So we have to search the local supermarket. The bed sheets weren't changed for 7 nights even i spotted a drop of wine and one day the aged towel was a bit smelly. The breakfast was simple, canned fruits, no salad."
4990,"While the price was fair, there are reasons I wouldn't stay there again. My child found an open condom box under under the bed! Speaking of the beds, they were some of the most uncomfortable beds we've slept on.  "
4991,"I loved this hotel - friendly, welcoming and quirky. The rooms are very comfortable with nice touches; free yoga sessions, nice toiletries and an in-house tv channel that plays The Big Lebowski on loop. The team in the hotel were super friendly - professional yet friendly. I also really liked the location. Near the train station and a block away from great shops and cafes. Definitely recommend. "
4992,"Elegant little rooms, but you have everything you need inside. It's romantic as the city is. Very nice personnel, they know English so it's easy to communicate. And they help you with recommendations for restaurants. Loved it"
4993,It is a master piece of architecture! It’s not every day you can sleep in a Óscar Niemeyer building! However the service stays far away from the architecture! Indeed the service is very poor mainly in what concerns housekeeping and breakfast!
4994,"If you are after something a bit different, modern with unique design this might be for you.   It’s quite dark, all black and white, perhaps not personally my favourite decor but others will really love it.  Good location, rooms are good, staff very helpful, especially the lovely Albert.  We were really happy with breakfast.  The pool is nice for a swim.  The sitting area isn’t amazing (although the view is great) and it felt really hot up there with little shade when we first arrived.  The sun moves though and we found some shade.  So all in all a good stay."
4995,Stayed 3 nights. Two king bed room.  The room was huge but had nothing in it except for the beds and not functional fridge. No hair dryer or shampoo. The walls are so thin..you could hear every step or movevent from upstairs or sideways. 5 am they start washer and dryer.Loud noises and cleaning staff yelling in Spanish will not let you fall asleep. Not the most pleasant stay to say the least.
4996,"the service needs improvement and was a bit disappointing. The bellboy, check in guy and the cleaning lady were friendly. For the price I would have liked the offer to take my bags to the room and a check in drink. All of that could be forgiven if the staff at breakfast looked happy and they for me were a real let down. Not a good morning in any language  in sight! Overall despite a great location, beautiful rooms, I felt it was not worth the money (very expensive). For the price I expect a higher level of service and attentiveness. Therefore for night 2 I went elsewhere."
4997,"I stayed in this hotel almost 4-5 trips over the past 2-3 years. The only reason is because the hotel is booked by the company. I cannot understand why we pick this hotel. Firstly, the hotel is really old. They are currently renovating the rooms which makes it better but the other amenities are old. The service is mediocre and if you look like an Asian, you'll probably won't get any notice. The swimming pool is large but you have to walk to another building, which is weird. Imagine walking outdoors in your toilet bathrobe. Their point system sucks (nothing like Starwood or Priority Club). The only upsides I can think of is the location. You can walk a few minute to great restaurants, pubs and MRT station. Overall, I won't recommend it. There are much better hotels in Shanghai…"
4998,"I was in Chicago for work and decided to stay at the Intercontinental since my company contracts them. Worse decision. The room was tiny, super outdated, air conditioning loud and all that, but the bathroom and customer service was the worse.   The bathroom tub was so low I almost fell while taking a shower. The next day, after a long day at work and being up at 4 AM PST (jet lagged), I came to the front desk and stated what happened. They said the only thing they can do is give me a room that has both a shower and a bath, and I said I am good if it's only just a shower. They said they'll make a key for me to see the room. Right away I asked if there will be an extra charge, and they said it will be an extra $50 a night. I said that will be impossible since my company has a…"
4999,This hotel is a bit of a strange one! We went on an adults only trip & although our room which overlooked the courtyard & was quiet others in the party weren’t so lucky. Some had children from school parties running up & down the corridors quite late & my son & girlfriend could hear the bar area. The room was clean & comfortable but there are no tea/coffee facilities which would have been nice. Lovely bathroom with a hairdryer & towels. The breakfast is a buffet style & plenty to choose from unless you’re Vegan like my son & then the choice is limited but there was cereal & soya milk. The Eastside gallery is adjacent to the hotel & the train station right across the road. There is also a kitchen area which is available to use if you want to cook your own food. The staff were…
5000,"I stayed here for 6 nights. The worst hotel I have ever stayed in during a business trip. Horrible -- my key cards did not work for 5 times on 5 days; I went to the reception to tell them about the problem. First time, I was told that it was because my phone was close to the key cards so I kept them away in the next days. It kept happening and I had to keep going to the reception and the staff was very rude each time."
5001,"I wanted to stay in a pod type hotel room for a while so booked here. The staff were really friendly and everywhere was clean.  The room itself was quite small but quirky. I think it would of been a lot better if the price reflected what it is, if it had been quarter of the price it would be great. "
5002,"We had made a reservation to stay here a couple nights for an weekend event (IML). Upon arrival, we did not feel comfortable at all there & went to stay at another hotel. I am still waiting to get over 525 released back to my credit card. Apparently these scammers put a 21 day hold on your card. Then want you to play games with your bank to get it back. Based on this detail alone, we do not recommend anyone to stay there. We have had to file a complaint with BBB to get my money back (which is still in dispute). They are very stubborn to deal with."
5003,"We stayed at the Ibis Styles on the Alexanderplatz for four days. Although a bed-and-breakfast budget hotel, I would give it 5 stars every time! The bedrooms are spacious and tastefully decorated. The free breakfast is sumptious and plentiful with eggs, a wide selection of cereals, breads, cooked meats, cheeses, fresh fruit salads. The coffee is strong, delicious and plentiful. There's a wide selection of teas, hot chocolate etc. The staff are helpful and courteous. Definitely five-star quality and absolutely value for money. I would recommend  it every time."
5004,"This was at least our 5th stay in 6 years.  As ever everything was clean, staff polite and everything as should be expected.  The early riser breakfast was very welcome as we needed to catch an early flight."
5005,Resent years it been good place to stay but now it has seen it's better days. Spa and gym are ok. Room are so so after the renovation. Previously business class rooms where better. Previously 26th sky bar was good place to start the evening but now 3€ pointless fee for men to see +65 yrs to death only being there... hope the great idea brings lot of business customers there. 
5006,"Wasn't of to a good start when we were 7 minutes late ,and they charged us 25euros after hours fee,even though girl meeting us watched us walk past guest house with our cases ! there was no Zuza sign."
5007,"Patronised by western tour groups, not get caught up with the Reception staff as a large group is checking in as they will get rid of you as quick as they can to attend to the needs of the Tour Group and its Leader. Otherwise the Hotel is pretty basic and a budget place in a ""dull"" city. Not sure why people come here unless a stop over even so..... Gym is a bit useless, breakfast was adequate though."
5008,"I wasn't expecting too much from a ** establishment but Motel One belies its rating by providing a very clean, modern and friendly experience. The room was pleasant and the bathroom reasonably sized with a good shower, if obviously a little basic with no wardrobe or safe. There was some noise from trains outside my room but this didn't disturb my sleep.  Very nice bar area with friendly staff. Decent breakfast available for 9.50 euros. The location is quite good being within walking distance of the Hauptbahnhof and Bellevue metro station is a pleasant 10 minute walk away. For about £50 per night Motel One was very good value.There is another, even more convenient, branch opposite the Hauptbahnhof but this one gets booked up very quickly."
5009,"Staff were friendly and welcoming, rooms were spotless and the position was central to everything, you can walk to most attractions and the bus from the train station, bus 147, pulls up right outside the hotel. There is a nice bar and restaurant adjacent to the lobby which attracts a bit of a crowd in the afternoon. A very pleasant stay."
5010,"Guest room lack basic needs cups, hot water heater etc. Front office representatives are customer focused and helpful. Request for plates, cups for use in guest room was bluntly refused by duty manager. "
5011,The hotel is perfectly located for ITB Berlin. A nice mix of guests. Homely environment and very genuine service. Rooms are small elegant and chic with a great design touch. It feels like a house hot a hotel and fabulous to unwind at the end of a stressful day. 
5014,Everything spectacular  Reception very kind  Breakfast all the choices to prepare in the best way to visit the city all day Room a little bit tiny but the view was magic  Bathroom big and with full amenities  Only negative point the lack of refill on complimentary water in the room and the fact the sauna broke down the same day of our arrival  Position stellar close to St Lazaire metro  Anyway this is a place to return for sure Final 4.9/5
5015,"Styaed here for a long weekend - the hotel was situated just a short ride into the city so not a bad location although a bit industrial.  Hotel was clean and tidy, did not eat here so cannot comment on food, however it was generally pleasant as you would expect from this chain.  Rooms were clean, the only let down was the lack of tea and coffe making facilities.  Overall, pleasant."
5016,"The hotel is good as you would expect with a Sofitel property. Room was clean and good standard. Room service food was terrible, worst Beef burger i have ever eaten in any hotel, poor quality frozen mass produced meat patty, in a hotel of this standard i would have expected the beef patty to have been made in house from quality mince. Otherwise a good hotel in a very nice and convenient position."
5017,"Upon arriving the hotel seems nice enough, when you arrive you'll find a trendy lobby with friendly staff. Only when you arrive in your hotel room you find out quickly enough that you can pretty much hear everything that's going on in the rooms beside you. Now obviously I did not expect a fully silent hotel since it is situated downtown, but having to go to the lobby multiple times at night for my three day stay because I could enjoy the phone calls being made in the room next to me verbatim does not constitute a good stay for me. Nothing else was done than send security to the room, after which the noise started up again when they left. Upon checking out I only got an excuse that they were sorry they couldn't place me in a different room - yeah thanks after spending 100+ usd a…"
5019,Very small room for a queen bed and rollaway bed. Very poor breakfast!  No room with chairs to sit down.
5020,First room that we were in the room didn’t seem to get cold. Second room only one vent blew out air. We had a junior suite which was a pretty decent size so to only have one vent is unacceptable and hot.   The staff is very accommodating but the hotel should really look into the AC issues. A bit pricy to have to deal with this.
5021,"This is truly a beautiful boutique hotel and just what you need after a busy day sightseeing. Spotlessly clean and lovely fresh rooms which are well appointed.  Staff are amazing, so helpful and welcoming nothing was to much trouble.  I feel for the quality of the hotel it is great value and would 100% recommend for anyone travelling to Paris.  "
5022,"We (myself,my sister and a friend)  came to stay here for our last stop for us traveling round the USA , we had been traveling all day and our flight was delayed so we didn’t arrive to the hotel until 6.45/7.00. First when we landed we asked to get a taxi and the taxi driver wasn’t very keen on taking  us to the hotel saying you can just get the bus  and we refused and said we wanted a taxi. Once we got to the hotel we where greeted by a lady who was checking us in etc. She was chatting away asking how long we where in town for etc as she handed us the keys she advised us that the doors would be locked from 10pm but more than likely to be earlier. We where abit confused and asked why. To which she stated its not the safest area and not to go down any of the streets beside the…"
5023,"If that's your thing then this is your hostel..... We had a private double room, bright red walls, black tiled bathroom, mirror on the ceiling and smelt of stale smoke..... The breakfast had a lot of choice but the bread was stale, the fruit was browning, egg yolks were grey and the ""hot water"" was lukewarm and couldn't brew a tea. Staff just seemed to stand around. Has a nice rooftop terrace, great views overlooking the red roofs of Porto from the room and a great location close to Sao Bento train station and metro, short walk to Se cathedral and walk over the bridge. The communal areas looked nice but didn't seem to be used much. Maybe it was just the time of day. For the money it's good value but after staying in an amazing hostel in Lisbon for the same price we were fairly…"
5025,"This hotel was a treasure and a great find!  It was clean and comfortable, the breakfast was delightful and the staff were very helpful. It is less than a 5 minute walk to the St. Georges metro station, and about a 12 minute walk to the Pigalle metro. You can also walk from the Gare du Nord train station, which is approximately 25 minutes. I would definitely stay here again, and I would recommend it anyone!"
5026,Well that's what I thought when I read the reviews. Didn't quite turn out that way.  Let's start with the checking in - not very impressed. No smile and no help. Paid for an extra night so not to be waiting. Asked if there was a chance of getting ocean views. Was told in a very somber way - $40 extra per night yet the Family friends we travelled with had Ocean views at no additional cost. Don't really enjoy lies... Was the room clean -yes  I paid $1400 less 2 years prior for a suite with mountain and ocean views with a smile. Great location and great service.  Let's look at the location- well ur closer to the zoo - that's a bonus if ur interested in the zoo. If your not- don't stay here! This I found was also a little bit rougher part of town. Some really bad characters around…
5027,i enjoyed my stay it also close to the famous church. room is clean and maintained well. i booked for three days and I need to cancel one day and when I called them they cancelled on the phone. of course I called before the time that they mentioned 
5028,"We stay here every year during the Cannes Advertising Festival. We love it more and more each year.  Everything from the car that picks you up from the airport to Nesquick, the beautiful dog that welcomes you at the door and the amazing service us what we love about this hotel.  The staff are so helpful, the rooms were cleaned every day, the breakfast is simple and delicious, the beds are comfortable and the air con was a saviour every night.   We will be staying again next year for sure!   Thank you for another great stay :)  Paul Confrey."
5029,"My best friend and I had rooms at the Regent for our yearly get together. The hotel is very well situated, walking distance to Brandenburg gate, the Holocaust memorial and Museum Island to name a few sites. You'd easily fill a couple of days just exploring by foot. As mentioned the rooms are large and well appointed - I loved the decor, classic & stylish. Different color combinations - at least based on our two rooms. Daily free evian water was a nice touch. Turn down service and other Five star treatment was in effect. The front desk and concierge went out of their way to be helpful and had good restaurant recommendations. There are many restaurants and cafes walking distance which is where we usually ate but I wish we'd explored a little more so that might be a research tip…"
5030,"We were a party of four who spent three nights in this establishment from August 4 to the 7th.  Let me begin by saying the location is excellent.  Less than a block from Las Ramblas, close to the Metro, close to a taxi stop and close to the many outdoor cafes on Las Ramblas.  Also near Barri Gothic (old Barcelona).  The location can't be beat.  The apartment is a bit snug, like most accommodations in Europe, but it was adequate and very clean.  The apartment has a full kitchen and a small living room.  The kitchen was very nicely furnished with every appliance you would need including a small refrigerator and a dishwasher.  It even had a clothes washer.  Our apartment had two bedrooms and two baths. One had a walk-in shower, the other a bathtub type shower.  If you have…"
5031,"Came home tonight after spending 3 nights here.  Hotel has a modern feel and ideally situated near to Checkpoint Charlie and one of the remaining parts of the Berlin Wall. We booked a superior double room and it was spotless.  The very large bed was comfy and the pillows were of an excellent quality - I slept like a baby.  Our room also had a huge balcony which was about the size of our room complete with a table and 2 chairs.  Slight downside was that it overlooked the car park, but having said that, if it had been summer, I would have probably still sat out there drinking my morning coffee.  The superior rooms came with a coffee machine which was great.and extra supplies were readily available from Reception.  We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel as there was a MacDonalds next…"
5032,"You should know that although this is a beautiful hotel with a good location that: 1.  Internet is unusable 2.  If you order room service your dirty plate will sit outside your room for almost a full 24 hours. 3.  Their cordless phones have low battery charge and will cut out on your calls. 4.  Local calls are expensive, $.50 per minute. 5.  I left early as I was not able to have a reliable internet connection and still have not received my refund 10 days later. 6.  The breakfast buffet is lovely.   Americans and foreigners should note that the internet here is too slow, and the connection falls too many times, to allow them to be able to connect to Skype, FaceTime, WhatsApp and others to make calls home.  I talked to several Brazilians, who agreed that the connection was very…"
5033,"The NH Museumkwartier hotel is well located if you are visiting the rijksmuseum and Van Gogh museum, or Pijp neighborhood. The room had a nice canal view and the bed was quite comfortable.  While the decor is contemporary, it is a bit worn - the sink in our bathroom was cracked, and neither the tub nor sink stopper worked.  The rooms and lobby furnishings could use a refresh.  Still the staff were attentive and friendly and the value for the price was good.  The hotel breakfast was very good, although pricey at nearly 40 euros for two.  If we could give half stars on TripAdvisor I would rate this as a 3.5 star hotel but it is not up to the 4 stars I give other NH hotels in major cities."
5034,Excellent hotel for a longer term stay. We were looking at apartments or hotels since we were staying longer than a week. This hotel offered a two room suite with kitchen and balcony in a good location for a fair price. The room we had was spacious. The furnishings were dated but adequate. The kitchen was well stocked and made eating breakfast and snacks very convenient.
5035,"Good: Nice location, nice and modern room, good food Bad: Bad service. When we arrived, they want us deposit some money If we using service in room, I hate that because I had already paid for full! They do not have the POS machine for card payment. 1 of their staff try to open our door without our permission because she want to bring towel miss in our room, such impolite ! No welcome drink, bad staff attitude, so many Chinese in that hotel, so noisy..."
5036,"I like this hotel very much. It's modern and it is situated in a nice area, close to shops, restaurants and public transport. You don't notice the mass tourism in this hotel and the staff is friendly.  My stay this time was very pleasant. The room was nice and clean at arrival and available early. One of the reasons for me to book this hotel for this occasion was also the possibility to choose for early check-in. It costs  €30 extra, but  it could be a good solution when your flight arrives early. The check-in went smoothly. A young man, I think it was one of his first working days, was very friendly and correct.  In this hotel you will be encouraged to re-use your towels or voluntarily skip the cleaning service. In exchange for skipping the cleaning service, you'll be offered a…"
5037,"With so many wonderful hotels in the Magnificent Mile area, look elsewhere - regardless of the price. The Hampton Inn on Huron leaves much to be desired.   First, it's not the cleanest hotel in the world. It need some major cleaning and updating. The rooms are just adequate, but me thinks the maid died. Crud under the easy chair. They also need to upgrade their bed linens. After all, the main purpose of hotel room is a place to sleep. The sheets had the texture on fine sandpaper, and the bed was not the mot comfortable in world.   The WiFi is inadequate for the number of people using it, and the real bugaboo is the elevators. They are small, few, and the wait for car can be ridiculous, especially when the hotel is at capacity. With 40 floors and only three tiny elevators, it's…"
5038,"Having had a wonderful stay at the Belmond Hotel Das Cataratas in Iguassu in early Feb we decided to call into the Belmond Copacabana Palace in Rio, even though not staying there. The veranda/pool area receptionist was most welcoming and took us to a table. We waited for nearly 30 minutes to get our drink, but failed, and that was after trying to get the attention of two waiters. The place was not particularly busy either.  We finally gave up and advised the lady who showed us to the table and she was most apologetic and referred us to her manager. He too was most apologetic and asked us to stay, however, we declined saying that ""the moment had gone"". The hotel looked beautiful and no doubt this was a one off but for us it was not a good experience."
5040,"The room was good, beds with curtains. Nice location, walking distance from Las Ramblas and others atractions in Barcelona. The staff was very friendly and nice. Would defineteley stay there again and recommend the hostel to a friend"
5041,"Proximity:  The hotel was far from the airport (paid 225RMB) and is not close by any metro train.  Its in the middle of Daibishu and Town Square. which are both 15 minute walk.  There are not much shopping around. Definitely far from any tourist attraction.    The Hotel: Signage outside is not properly maintained (some of the LED are dead and letters are not evenly installed).  Staff didn't know much english and have to refer you to other people.  I was not advised that swimming pool would be under renovation for 1 month which was exactly why i chose this place over other hotels and to top it off, aircon in the entire hotel was not working.  When i asked the front desk about it they said they only turn on the aircon when outside temperature was at least 26 degrees!  I was…"
5042,"I stayed in this room for less than 5 minutes and I was appalled that housekeeping forgot to clean - see photos. The room was fifthly and not suitable for anyone who cares about cleanliness.   [ ] The room smelled like a smoking room  [ ] Bed skirt was dirty not cleaned - brown stains covering large portions of the bed skirt [ ] Multiple Stains on the carpet and sofa [ ] A/C was strapped to the window with black tape, blinds were dusty  [ ] Stains on the sofa   I immediately informed the front desk and they sent the housekeeping manager, who agreed that the room was filthy. The housekeeping manager then called the housekeeper who cleaned the room who also agreed that room was filthy. She then stated that the room was dirty because the hotel pays her low wages. At this point,…"
5043,"Great place to stay in Berlin. Excelent location, close to everything. The rooms are nice and big. You will remember those expensive carpets. This hotel also has a great value for money. Nothing to complain. Recommended."
5044,"I travel to Sao Paulo on business a fair amount and my company has us stay at the Staybridge Suites.  It has continually been less than impressive.  They have given me the wrong room keys more than once, have missed servicing my room and it just appears to be poorly run.  The location is good, and the price is better than most, so that is an attraction, but go in with low expectations."
5045,"This place is not for families. They let people smoke week around the pool completely unchecked.  The food and drinks are decent, but the prices are excessive and the condition of the amenities is poor. The cushions on the deck chairs appear to be on about their 9th year (see photo).  There are much nicer places to stay down here. "
5046,"Unfortunately, we did not find that this property was worth the cost. It does have several nice things going for it, such as the pools, the sunset view, and the close proximity to Oia, but we found it sorely lacking in many of the smaller things that make a luxury resort worth the price. Individually none of these things is a big deal, but they add up to a feeling that you are not really being welcomed. My list of some of the issues with the hotel are as follows:  No private transport from airport. For over $800 pretty night, you should not have to share a cramped van with 8 other people that will wind up and down the roads of Santorini for 90 minutes before finally dropping you off at the hotel, hot and nauseated. -We were chastised for quietly eating Pringles and cans of coke…"
5048,"Friendly, clean and comfortable - we loved our stay at Hotel Passy Eiffel! It was easy to find and all the staff were helpful and welcoming. Our room had everything we needed and was spotlessly clean. "
5050,"Very comfortable room, and large bathroom size (for Europe standards). We had a very quiet room facing the garden, and with the shades down we had absolute quiet and dark right in the middle of a busy part of town. Lauren was very helpful and accommodating during our stay. It was a heat wave in Paris but the room actually stayed cool. Close to so many metro and bus plus the Marché st honore for eating options. Loved it!"
5052,"My husband and I stayed at the hotel for two nights in mid-February as a romantic belated Vday mini-vacay away from our son and the NJ snow.  When we arrived at our room, which was in one of the older buildings, the décor in the bedroom was updated in a grey modern style but the bathroom and the entrance were not updated and had the ""Spanish Colonial"" red tile and super old and outdated tub. We bought our stay on Jetsetter at a reduced rate, so for the price we paid, it did not bother us.  However, it would be exceptionally disappointing for a normal rate.    What did bother us within an hour of being in the room is my husband stepping on a wet red stain on the carpet between the bed and the night stand.  We called for housekeeping and waited for quite some time.  As we waited,…"
5053,Never stayed in Hampton with such a poor service. Only one customer service person for Hampton and homewood suites in a hotel which is fully booked.  You wait 15 minutes - reach customer service desk . Then he listens to you and says come back in 15 minutes to resolve the issue as he has other guests to take care of.  This is the Pretty bad for Hilton brand - have stayed at another Hampton in Springfield recently - bad customer service . Time for Hilton to reconsider alliance with cheaper class hotels  Never stay again.
5055,"Just returned from a week long stay at the Villa Olympia for a friends Wedding and could not fault their service at all. Some of our group arrived late at night with young children and even though the kitchen was closed they still went out their way to make food for them. On the day of the wedding Rita organised for us all to get to our friends hotel in their minibus (at no extra charge) also one of our party needed to go to the pharmacy one day in the next town and once again Rita took us in her car for no charge. The hotel rooms are basic but very clean and are cleaned/towels changed daily. The pool area is nice and food from the bar is lovely and reasonably priced. All in all, I would definitely recommend the Villa Olympia to anyone, Rita and her staff can not do enough for…"
5057,"If you're on a budget while in Shanghai, do a bit more research because you can probably find a better hotel at the same rate as this one. The location is so so, however there is a metro station near by. The rooms are super outdated, with the lingering cigarette smoke stink all around. We changed 3 rooms until finally I said screw it and upgraded to a suite, which is way better, but obviously more expensive. The hotel did throw in free breakfast in the price of the upgrade. We bargained a bit on the price per night so it wasn't too bad of an expense."
5058,"I am currently staying in the Sheraton Grand Chicago. When I arrived at the hotel my room was not ready but the desk clerk offered apologies and an upgrade free of charge which was great. He also said there would be a $100 hold for incidentals. That was fair and great as well. The next day before leaving the hotel for dinner I checked my account and discovered that I had been charged an additional $150.74 above the previously agreed $100 hold for incidentals, I attempted to speak with the desk manager to ask what the charge was for and if there was any way to correct it. After being told several different explanations, after being told that I had a balance of $82 from internet usage and lunch (meanwhile I had already been charged $250.74 which maxed my card and left me in a…"
5059,"Perfectly adequate hotel - clean, helpful, buffet breakfast. My only problem was that when I got the taxi from the airport the road outside was closed for a car show so I had to walk the last 200 metres or so."
5060,"The Andaz is ideally situated, right in the heart of the 9 Streets; also, it is one of the most uniquely designed hotels I have ever visited. Unfortunately, the service element wasn't up to 5-star standards.   Everyone we interacted with was friendly, but there were continuous miscues during our 3-night stay. We requested our room be serviced much later in the day, and a maid walked in on me changing 10 minutes later; our amenities weren't replenished, or when they were, it was insufficient (i.e. giving us one towel).  We were staying on separate Hyatt points reservations, and I had emailed months earlier to let them know and I was assured that there would be no issues; unfortunately, it was a hassle ironing out the details each day we were there.  It is a shame, because the…"
5062,"This cosy and stylish hotel is located a few meters from Eiffel Tower and public transport. The staff is friendly and efficient. In the vicinity of the hotel, museum, restaurants and shops. Great place to stay for business and leisure. Wifi is free and available in the rooms. Continental breakfast is superb. Drinks and snacks available 24 hrs. Open space for smokers."
5063,"Room was gross, old and deteriorated. I’m all for vintage, but invest a little money. Toilet kept running, trash under bed, dust all over furniture, wallpaper peeling off walls, MOLD all over ceiling, the list goes  on. Called manager and she did not care and just said she will let housekeeping know. Sounds like these complaints are somewhat common."
5064,"This is a very good hotel, very clean, good services, breakfast delicious and tasty. Rooms are small but in Paris you need the room only for shower and sleeping. By the way, the conditions of sleeping are very well, the beds are confortable and the air condition sistem works also very well. The metro station is very close to the hotel, Bastille metro station is about eight minutes distance by walking. A supermarket Carrefour is very close to the hotel, about five minutes by walking. Ile de la Cite, the location of Cathedral Notre Dame de Paris is about 20-25 minutes by walking. So, if you need a good hotel in Paris do not hesitate, this is it."
5065,"Pros:  - A quaint and nicely preserved art decó house keeping some of the original tiled decorations. - Great location but not too central. City highlights mostly walkable. - Good breakfast, though a bit too focused on sweets.  Cons:  - Too high rate for the services we got in exchange (it was high season, 103e night) - Underwhelming room for the price, with a small bathroom.  - No lift. "
5066,The location is good. There is a metro station Just infront of the hotel. Rooms are specious and clean. They offer 2 beers and 2 bottles of Water every day. For me there are 3 things to improve. 1. Usually there is no service in the lobby. When you need something they ask you to go to the restaurant which is not in the hotels control. 2. I paid 6 euros for water to the restaurant but both me and my wife are sure that the bottle was open and filled with tab water. 3. The restaurants music was too loudg and not nice to have in the lobby.
5067,"When we first entered the hotel there was a nice friendly welcome and we were looked after nicely, as expected. The suite we were in was decorated well, although the suites were smaller than expected! Although the room wasn't that big, the walk in shower and bath were ample sized. Unfortunately, the first night we were in a suite with no windows and the air conditioning wasn't working so we struggled to sleep even though the beds were comfortable. On the second night we were moved to another suite that was above the restaurant/bar area where the music was loud until 1 am on a Tuesday night. So make sure you aren't above there if you like a quiet nights sleep. The staff were on the whole friendly but not consistently offering great service like I would expect from this kind of…"
5068,Poor location as there is very little in the way of local restaurants or bars. You'll be unlikely to want to frequent the depressing hotel bar. Terrible lack of sound insulation between rooms. Staff very pleasant. 
5069,We stay here for 4 nights  Not One time in the morning when going down to the breakfast nobody said good morning  For 4 days  Maybe is normal in lisabon  Breakfast good but normal  Every day bacon cold!!! The rooms are very nice
5070,"Four night stay for a city break at Crowne Plaza. Hotel is quite corporate with lots of business customers. This was not really a problem but simply not a place I would normally stay. Staff are very efficient, helpful and friendly. We had a superior room which was well equipped and comfortable. Breakfast was good quality with plenty of choice but VERY busy between 8 and 9 (but they do warn you about this). Hotel is quite a way from the main areas of Berlin but just get a Berlin travel card (€7 per day) and use the bus/subway/trams. Public transport is brilliant, easy to use and very frequent. The 100 bus runs every 10 mins from the Zoo (round corner from hotel) to Alexanderplatz passing most main areas."
5071,Unruly party allowed to make noise after curfew time. Notified front desk and staff member visited group and spoke to them. Unable to get to sleep with adjacent noise including fire alarm set off three evenings in a row with same group. Asked for a change in room but party should have been asked to leave after first occurrence. Should be vigilant in not accepting partygoers to a family accommodation. 
5072,"The room was not very clean as I like. Under the sheets I have found someones hair, couple of spiders and web around the bed. Also the patio was dirty and was not decorated nicely. Room service was very slow and did not restock the bath items (salt,bubble soap). They did not even leave slippers or shaving blade for us. When we booked the hotel, we were told that up on arrival we will get a discount as AAA member, but they never gave us this discount.  However, the property is beautiful. Swimming pool is great. Restaurant is good. Shuttle service is very helpful."
5073,"I stayed in this hotel for 2 nights on a recent business trip. The location is not bad - in walking distance to one of Chongqing's sub-centres with plenty of shops and some restaurants.  When I entered my room I found it to be somewhat chilly so I tried to change the air condition into heating mode, which usually works in most Chinese hotels (there are no regular heating systems in Southern China). I found that the air condition made the room even more cold, so I asked at the reception. They send a technician who told me that the air condition would need half an hour to get warm. Well, it didn't. The receptionist offered me an additional duvet, which I politely declined, as I would have much prefered a comfortable room to yet another duvet. So I ended up spending 2 uncomfortable…"
5074,"We recently spent 6 wonderful days at this small boutique hotel. When we arrived we were pleasantly surprised that we were upgraded to a larger room because it was available, without having to pay more for it. The room faced the courtyard and was quiet and lovely. The front desk staff were very helpful and pleasant and made reservations for us when we asked at local restaurants. We looked forward to the breakfast and lovely dining room area each day. The location is very close to the Marais and there are many restaurants close by. The bus station is around the corner and across the street and it is a short walk to the metro.  This small hotel is definitely a fabulous find!"
5075,"When   you arrive at the hotel, your expectations increase, it is a wow moment... But from there is down hill...  The room is simple, my rooms at mercure times Square are much better. The towels are old from an old chain. I ordered room service and the meat was way overcooked.  At the restaurant you felt depressed...  I suggest that you certainly think twice before booking a room here."
5076,"I really wanted to give this hotel 5 stars, and I believe that next time I visit I might be able to. Why? Well.. This is 1914 build palatial villa with large gardens, set in one of the most beautiful and expensive residential areas of Berlin. Recently taken over by a Berlin clothing designer, the building and design can really not be faulted at all. There was so much to look at and appreciate that I could have done with a few more days to take it all in. The building itself if the most decadent villa I have ever been in, beautiful in every way, amazing spaces and features. The design really complements the architecture and uses the space well. I particularly enjoyed the atmosphere in the bar for a late night drink and my favourite Truffle Fries. The room also had a lot to look…"
5077,"We spent 3 nights in this hotel, where we've been upgraded to the suite. At the first sight, it looked amazing, then within 3 nights, you could find out all the issues this room and this hotel had.  First of all, the room was big, very big, and could have been super nice with some minor improvements. The lighting in the room is very low, the safebox was broken, the soap pump in the shower was empty and they never filled it back (while the shampoo was), the sewer in the shower was clogged and if you spent more than 5 minutes in the shower, half of the room was flooded.  Secondly, the staff there was probably the less nice and the less professional we've had in all Vietnam. We are not the kind of complaining, but here, sorry to tell but you could really feel that the hotel is…"
5078,"Excellent location for city centre. There's parking and staff had reserved a space for us. There's a €50 deposit for the garage key. You will get this back as long as you don't lose it. It costs €15 a day to park. The Brandenburg gate, TV Tower and Riechstag are within walking distance of the hotel. There is a tram stop nearby, as is the train station. There is an underground stop right outside the hotel. Room is small but clean and there are no drinks facilities in the room. There's shower gel and hand wash in the room but take your own shampoo.  The shower is good but I would have liked a little more room to move about in it.  The hairdryer is not the most powerful but does it's job. You can get BBC World Service on the telly. There are lifts and stairs. Staff friendly. …"
5079,"The place was nice. Had a good time in the city. To check out, there was a long line, so I decided to forego the receipt. Surprise, when reviewing my credit card statement, the charge was much higher than the receipt from my online booking. I disputed it with the credit card company, to which they replied that the fees were for parking. When I pointed out that I parked at another lot, they changed their mind and decided the fees were local fees and taxes.  If you stay there, the charge to your credit card will be for much more than your online receipt."
5080,"Extremely disappointed.  First, wouldn’t allow me to check in as my wife did the reservation. We were in differemt flights and had to wait for her. Service from Front desk was abysmal.  Second, noise at 6am from repair work was unbearable. Impossible to sleep.  Third, gym is a joke. Had to spend $30 at Soulcycle instead.  Fourth. Workers across the building will see everything that happens in your room. Don’t walk naked in your room.  No coffee machine in room.  $320.  JOKE.  "
5081,Very nice. Excellent resteraunt in the garden by canal. The only thing they need is either air conditioning or at least fans in the room. Nice breakfast in the mornings. Staff very happy to speak English.
5082,"Location is good, but check-in was a nightmare.  The staff was very disorganized and it took much longer than it should have.  We booked 3 rooms on 1 reservation almost a year prior to our arrival and were told we would have rooms near to each other- we are on floors 2, 7, and 12.  Not very family friendly with young children.  Additionally, we were given a room with a sofa bed without being told at check-in and when we requested a change, were told nothing was available and the staff was dismissive to our concerns.  The rooms are very noisy as well - a lot of noise from outside as well as the halls.  The rooms were very clean, but dated.  Overall, not a place I would recommend."
5083,"It satred bad and ended worse. Altough my booking was paid by Internet tehy charged my card again. The electronic key never worked. The wake up service failed. There were no towels in the room. Altough breakfast would have been included, they charged again. The superior room should be at least 28m2 as they promote on their site, but actually is much smaller."
5084,"The apartment is modern and sparsely furnished. The railway lines are very close and constantly noisy.  The stairs up to the apartment ( we were on the first floor ) are narrow, concrete and unforgiving. I would say these are not suitable for small children or elderly visitors. The apartment has only one bathroom and a separate toilet.  We had booked and paid for a different apartment but when we arrived we were substituted with this place which was less convenient that the one we had previously chosen.  Its about 10 mins walk to central station, or a 2 min bus journey.  Its not the nicest location in Amsterdam, but there are plenty of cafes, restaurants and shop within a few minutes walk.  There were a number of other quite noisy groups staying in the same complex and the…"
5085,"The hotel is situated on the outskirts of Funchal so you will need to get taxis into town (around 8 Euro). The hotel does have a courtesy bus but every time we wanted to catch it, it was full as it called at other Pestana hotels before arriving at ours (only runs until 6pm). Rooms are well appointed and kept clean, with beach towels provided. Nice pool area overlooking the sea. Pool bar food was rubbish so avoid it, but the in-house Italian restaurant open on Tues & Sundays evenings was very good. We did not try the buffet at the hotel as we ate out most nights in town. Breakfast was very good, and plenty of choice. The most irritating issue with this hotel was the painstaking check in. They were so painfully slow. If you arrive on a bus via a package holiday and you are the…"
5086,"We've visited Berlin the very first time and this hotel's location absolutely superb! The breakfast is not for 5 stars hotel. Very pure variety of food ,not freshly cooked food available ,only fried eggs."
5087,"The hotel is made up of 2 large towers linked on the 4th floor. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. There are 3 outside pools (these were not available to us as it was early in the season) and 1 inside pool. The restaurant was buffet style, which is fine for breakfast and lunch , but for a 5 * hotel there were no table cloths for the evening meal. Which did not make the evening meal special in any way.The food was plentiful and cooked well, but it appeared that the vegetable chief never discussed the possible menu combinations with the meat and fish chiefs, resulting in strange combinations of food. It was only at the middle part of the week that wine was automatically offered when being seated,without trying to seek a waiter yourself. The Italian restaurant, which…"
5089,Staff were friendly and gives you advise about transportation and the city and so.room was clean. Only towels was old but were clean too. Breakfast was OK. But in breakfast they used to dilute the juices so they were not good.on first day the fresh bananas were old actually too  riped and almost all were black but on second day they were fresh and new. Overall the hotel was good.
5090,"Pool has been out of service sense day 2 of a 7 day stay.  We were told it will be at least 5 days until it's fixed. No hot tub. Asked if anything would be taken off our bill and got a "" are you kidding--& dirty look "". Ice machine on one floor only and should be at the city dump. Husband got white paint on him somewhere in this "" being painted"" rat trap. Noisy, No tea bags in room, No beach chairs, but still the price is low ( around 100.00 $ a day. So as always : you get what you pay for. We're not getting soaked ( PUNT INTENDED : pool out of service! ) how dry I am👅👙not needed here!"
5092,"The suite tandart we stayed was far from expected, smoke smell in, no hooks in the bathroom. Evening meal in the restoran was disappointment, no tablecloth, no glasses, no cutlery on the tables.......       "
5093,We stayed here for 3 nights recently. It’s very close to the airport (€10 taxi fare) which is convenient and about a 8 minute walk to the nearest metro station where you can get to the downtown area quite quickly.   Check in was simple and were soon in our room on the 4th floor. It was quite small and dated. The bed was comfortable. AC wasn’t brilliant but did cool the room down eventually.  Bathroom was reasonable size but dated. Shower head kept falling down so had to hold it to take a shower.  Breakfast was included in our room rate. Not sure what to say other than it was OK but nothing special.  It was my birthday whilst we were there and they left us a bottle of bubbly to celebrate - very appreciated.
5094,"I saw some pictures here and thought all room looked that great... But surprise surpise, i got a crappy old room. Eveyrthing looked and felt old. The location is awesome and i didnt have time for the pool at the top. Thenreception and coffe bar are depressing... It desperately needs an overhaul.  Bathroom sink was disgusting dirty. View is gorgeous but dirty glass screws and looks horrible. Aluminum window is peeling... And the hallway ceiling on 9th floor had an incredible hole from water leaks."
5096,"Would avoid this hotel.  The design is terrible in terms of noise.  Customer service is underwhelming and seems understaffed.  Few rooms ready at check-in and door to bathroom broken.  Next morning elevator repair people also showed at 5:30 am and were extremely loud.  Needless to say, difficult to sleep with that going on for well over 2 hours.  Management willing to offer some points but finally comped the room after further discussion."
5097,Good points: The hotel had beautiful gardens and the location was close enough to town without being too busy. It was convenient for eating and shopping. Plenty of sun loungers around the pools and reception were helpful.   Breakfast was plentiful in terms of choice and well presented.   There were renovation works at the hotel and BA only advised me of this three days before I left for my trip. I would have booked elsewhere had I known. There was a pervading smell of turpentine and glue in the hallways.   The bad: There were renovation works at the hotel and BA only advised me of this three days before I left for my trip. I would have booked elsewhere had I known. There was a pervading smell of turpentine and glue in the hallways during the day. As I had booked a land view room…
5098,There was put effort to interior. Customer service was poor. We forgot some expencive cosmetics and also medicin in our room. I contacted hotel at the same day but cosmetics and medicin weren't found. Not nice experience. Breakfast was also poor.
5099,"Overall I am happy with my stay at Hotel Lis Baixa. The building is beautifully renovated and the room I was in was great. The only thing that was missing was a small desk / seating area, as the double room had only one chair.  Hotel is located in the heart of the old city making sightseeing really easy and you will also enjoy gorgeous views from your room.  When it comes to the staff we only met one lovely girl at the reception and one in the restaurant. The rest of the staff seemed indifferent and not very much bothered about satisfying their guests.  The cleanliness is something that really needs to be improved. The room itself was clean, but the sheets had few little stains, the glasses in the room had lipstick marks on them and the toilet was only surface-clean.  Our…"
5100,It was not the first time that my wife and I suffered with the noise around the hotel .. and that last time the guests of rooms on the same floor of mine made a lot of noise in the middle of the night. Poor sleep quality.
5101,"Very trendy and modern furnishings throughout. Rooms are very spacious even at the standard level. Fantastic views from the gym over the Reichstag to give you some great visual motivation for your workouts! Staff were ok, but check in and some of the front desk agents seemed a bit robotic in their service and definitely felt that I was one of the last of many check ins of the day. WiFi was also very temperamental in the guest room during the entire 5 day stay which was frustrating. Nonetheless a great hotel! "
5102,Check-out date was wrong on arrival. My company had to resend the email to clarify it. My access card stopped working half way through the week. AC is louder than any other unit I ever used (it is disturbing even during the day). Street facing rooms are way too noisy. The walls are literally shaking when someone walks in the room above. Takes a minute or two at least to get hot water in the bath. Room services did not know when I`ll have my laundry ready. I had to phone 3 times during the day till the last person was able to tell me. The fact that you can hear everything happening the floor above including walking makes your stay extremely unpleasant (also impossible to concentrate on work). the gym is tiny (smaller than your room) considering the 4 stars rating of the hotel. In…
5104,"The building, interior design etc is very impressive. The views are great and the rooms very funky. We were very disappointed with the service however. We went for my son's birthday on the 12th February this year, we live in Shanghai so this was a splurge and a special treat for us as a family. There were some nice touches like a little cup birthday cake left out for him and the room was really very cool. When we went for a swim, however, they were testing the alarms which they had not warned us about so we had the annoying sound of constant alarms going off which didn't make the fitness suite very enjoyable for any of us. After our swim, we chose to go out for dinner as we did not find the restaurants to serve particularly family friendly meals. So we went off to an Italian…"
5105,I had requested a twin bed room for one night and we were then booked into the hotel for a further week under a separate booking that had been confirmed as a twin room prior to arrival. We were greeted at reception by the surly Valentina who was rude and not the slightest bit interested in doing anything. The manager was likewise. He advised us that just because you book a particular type of room doesn’t mean you can have that type of room. I travel all over the world and that was the first time I’ve ever been told that! Eventually we were given an upgrade and a sofa bed and bed for 3 of our 8 days. On one of the days my friend was sick and stayed in the hotel. A group of women who were clearly there partying continued to do so despite her making several calls to the front desk…
5106,"The hotel stays in a nice historical building and it is very well located. Nevertheless, maintenance os the public spaces, swimming pool and cleanliness problmes make it a not so charmfull stay. The hotel clearly need to imprive in quality of the services and maintenance of the public areas."
5107,Having previously visited at the Radisson Elizabete which is a 5 minute walk from this hotel I did not expect the experience to be so contrasting. Elizabete was a personal and excellent experience whereas Lativja felt more like an airport transit hotel.   What made me feel particularly bitter about this experience was being told by reception when we checked in that there was a €40 charge for standard room guests to access the sauna and pool.  They advised that if we upgraded to a surperior room we would have access free of charge. Nothing was mentioned about this at the time of booking. I have since complained to our online booking agency who contacted the hotel about the issue. The hotel denied to them that there is/was a fee for using the facilities and said that there was…
5108,The hotel was very easy to find and very good for the U bahn.  Location was good for the technical museum and easy to get all around Berlin from.  All the staff were friendly and helpful.  The rooms were very clean but a little small and my room was a bit cold.I had breakfast which was good with a wide range of choice.  The man running the breakfast room was helpful.  The bar was also nice and not too busy.The price was also good.I would happily stay in this hotel again.
5109,"Posted check in time is 3 PM.  However, my room was not available until 5:30 PM, preventing me from showering and changing clothes in time to attend a business meeting, resulting in a missed networking opportunity and associated financial loss.   Bathroom drain was partially clogged and there was a strong marijuana odor in room.  Front desk personnel were not accommodating or cooperative."
5110,"I stayed at the Palmer House and was woken up in the middle of the night with this bed bug on me. I called security and the bug was still there when they arrived. They treated my luggage in their bed bug station and moved me to a second rooms which had blood on the wall. They moved me to a third room. By this time I was incredibly upset because I had a job interview the next day and had no sleep. I filed a claim for reimbursement with the hotel and they denied my claim stating that I failed to prove there were bed bugs.  Keep in mind that I had a photo, their own employee saw it, and they hauled off all of my luggage and treated it.  I went through hell and wasn't even apologized to or reimbursed. I will never stay at a Hilton again."
5111,"Perfectly situated...very close to both the beach and the shopping centre. What surprised us especially about the location is that although it is in the centre of Cannes, it is very quiet.  The apartment itself: very beautiful furniture in french style. perfectly clean and and very good equipment (TV set, air condition, etc). balcony with nice view over the roofs of Cannes.  A parking card for a public parking is available on request (parking is a few minutes away, but that was no problem for us). We have been there several times since 2011 and enjoyed it everytime a lot."
5112,"The most important thing that I was satisfied with was the location. It was near all the attractions, metro station and Sao bento train station. The hotel was small and clean. Check in and checkout were fast and easy. There was not safe box in the room but they offer one in lobby for free. The view of my room was awful and the size was good enough for a person. In my room bottle of waters and tea maker were not available and the bathroom did not had a bathtub. Staff were helpful but they did not smile. I think it was best value and I recommend staying here. "
5113,"I am a regular customer and a Platinum member.  Stayed here with my wife during a city trip. Great location in the heart of Berlin, walking distance to the Reichstag and great public transport connections. Hotel as the usual standard so nothing to complain about.  Only thing I would improve is that there were no water bottles in the room (9th floor) and that there were comparatively to other hotel not enough towels in the bath room.    I would recommend this hotel."
5114,"Sink was clogged, the hand shower was broke, I could hear the neighbor opening the door as he would enter my room (and hearing him throw up afterwards), the staff was helpful but not very friendly, the shaving kit was missing in the room but was quickly delivered. Overall the hotel is ok but for the price I would expect a lot more"
5115,This was a stunningly beautiful hotel we stayed in for two nights at the end of a four city European trip.  Good sized twin room and bathroom.  Sadly during our stay it was let down by the bar staff who seemed to have a weird system of service.  It took 20 minutes to get one beer and one glass of wine despite not appearing that busy.
5116,"We too paid $600 for a night in a clean but old room.  The view is only accessed from the little balcony.  The beach in front was packed, so was the beachfront café.  I know many people like a busy vibe, but we had just come in from Kauai, which we loved.  It made for a disappointing last night of our holiday."
5117,"I stayed for one night at the Diva hotel and it was a terrible experience. A part from the location - which is great, my friend and I were poorly treated from the moment we arrived. The concierge would not give us proper instructions about parking and was upset about helping us with the bags. When we were to check in, the attendant who was doing the procedure just interrupted it three times to talk to other guests in a very disrespectful manner. After we asked for tips on where to grab a bite and they gave us the worst possible venues options. The room was really noisy - the AC sounded like an old refrigerator. Awful experience."
5118,"Hotel was impeccably clean and the staff couldn’t have been more helpful and friendly. Bar service was great with good brands always available.  The let downs were the standard of catering. While perfectly acceptable for a 3* establishment it was not 5*. The pool area whilst kept beautifully presented and clean was really cramped and I dread to think what it will be like at peak. Nonetheless, we enjoyed our relaxing break here"
5119,"Upon arrival we noticed that light bulbs were burned out in the room.  We were indulged with one bar of soap to share between the shower and the sink.  There were long black hairs on the towels hanging in the bathroom.  The lamp shade in the bedroom was literally hanging on by a thread.  There was absolutely no water pressure.  If you flushed the toilet while the shower was running, the water would redirect the water to the bath tub spigot.  The remote control for the TV in the bedroom did not work.  The resort is so outdated that they boast of having VCR's in the units, to which I realized after we rented a DVD.  The view from both windows was a worn down building with broken windows.  There was a sign in the lobby boasting of a continental breakfast.  Upon going down in the…"
5120,"No breakfast included in the rate, awful coffee A double room has only 2 towels. If you take a shower there is no spare towels to wash your hands. No minibar. Not insulated bedroom (noise and vibrations from the AC)                     "
5121,"This property is exceptional. Paul, who checked us in, was excellent, following up on our questions immediately. The manager was extremely pleasant and accommodating each time we encountered him. The building is immaculate, and it provides exceptional waterfront views of the beautiful Parisian canal. The complimentary buffet hot breakfast is superb. Paul and Pierre assisted us with our luggage upon our checking out. I recommend this property as one of the most exceptional properties I've encountered."
5122,"Checked in at 10:30 PM.  Went to bed but awoke to a warm room.  AC did not work and fan only blew warm air.  Took a long time for staff to move us to another room at 1:00AM.  Still charged FULL price for a very bad night's ""sleep"".  Management never made contact to offer apology or work on a compromise on the rate.  Stayed here a few times in the past with no problems.  I see a (negative) shift in customer service and overall hotel experience.  "
5123,"Great location (very close to 2 metro stations), friendly staff, huge room for paris (we stayed in superior room) and very nice breakfast. We also loved the Astotel service that allows one to enjoy complementary snacks and drinks throughout the hotel you stay in plus any other hotel in Paris that is part of their chain (in expensive city like Paris this is super nice addition). Would definately stay in this hotel when we go back. "
5125,"Very clean, and spacious room and bathroom.  Did not eat the breakfast there but enjoyed their lobby/bar area and had delicious apple strudel.  At the restaurant had a great burger and dessert.  Conveniently located near mass transit, restaurants and shopping.  Staff was very nice.  Would stay there again."
5126,"Really disappointed in this hotel. I was given a room next to the elevator and I could hear the elevator motors from the room. I packed up and switched to another room, but there was limited availability, so I was given an accessible room and was extremely disappointed in the room, especially after seeing the first room. And I can still hear some kind of mechanical motor sound! I really thought this hotel would be of better quality.  I guess it’s just old and dated."
5127,"this hotel is great. lovely staff with excellent service, clean hotel which is the thing I look out for the most. good for couples, blackout curtains for the huge windows. would recommend. only thing is bottom floors smell heavily like food because of the restaraunt. "
5128,"The B&B is located on a busy street and not well labeled.  The location was reasonably good for our needs.  You have to look for the street number and then you will see a very small sign on the outside.  Enter the lobby area and take the elevator up one floor where there will be another door with another small sign.  Within the B&B there are 6 rooms that share a living area and kitchen.  Some of the rooms do not have their own bathroom, but our 2 rooms did.  Right outside our door was the kitchen area and it was a little loud in the morning as they prepared the breakfast.  The breakfast had limited selections, but was good.  The room that we had was spacious with a bathroom.  The beds were comfortable and the shower pressure was good, but the water temperature setting was slightly difficult to set.  Please note that you must contact them 30 minutes before your arrival since the check-in area is not staffed and someone must meet you upon your arrival.  This was not included in our booking information when we booked on-line.…"
5129,"second stay in this hotel, the staff is professional and with a smile. the location is good with 3-4 min walking from UBAN and few minutes from city sites. we had a very nice time and the hotel was definitely part of the experience "
5130,"This hotel which in most part caters to business, has a great location right beside the main train station and a large shopping mall.  It's also very close to the river and lots of bars/restaurants.  Unfortunately they nickle and dime you which is surprising for what you pay.  The WiFi is only free for 1 hour and then they charge you.  In today's age of travel it's extremely rare that you find a hotel that doesn't offer free WiFi.  It is almost considered a mandatory and yet they charge.  I wouldn't go back for this reason alone.  This has been mentioned numerous times on the reviews in tripadvisor and the management keep repeating the same answer.  They obviously want the extra money.  Oh yeah, they also charge for coffee in the room.......  Find a better spot.  There's lots."
5131,"I'm for frequent travel due to work, with about 100 hotel nights per year. I'm a former Marriott Gold member until I stopped using Marriott brand a couple years ago. Our stay at W was from May 16-18 in room type Wonderful Exchange. Here is a detailed review: Overall - Location of hotel would be the biggest plus. Very close walking distance to the city center. We made parking reservation at P1 Central for 20EUR per night, which is a 10min walking distance. We wanted to drop-off our luggage and park the car but the bell desk staff semi-threatened us that valet parking is the only option, and we won't find anything below 55EUR which he offers, and there is high chance the car will be damaged/stolen etc. It was very uncomfortable. Room is more spacious than expected. Interior design…"
5132,"staff were unfriendly, breakfast was poor and the place was crowded, noisy and a bit dirty. I have stayed at dozens of hostels and I have no doubt in my mind this was the worst I have experienced. I feel obligated to note the location is great (a few blocks from the beach), but other hostels I've stayed in in Rio are far far superior. Do yourself a favour and avoid 'El Misti'."
5133,"We got room for almost 200 with no window, window was facing indoor parking lot, even the hotel was almost empty.  AC did not work. No refunds. Whenever we tried to talk to manager of the hotel, she was ignoring us. Letting us she is at the meeting. Multiple time of the day all week. When she met us on the hall way, she had nasty face and not willing to talk to us at all. NO REFUNDS. NO GOOD WILL TO HELPS US FOR OUR MONEY. WORST HOTEL IN MIAMI !"
5134,"I have been to The Drake many times for the afternoon tea so I had high expectations, despite some of the reviews that I had read.  When I came in from the Chicago cold at approximately 11:00pm to check in to a nice cozy room, the LAST thing I want or expect is for the temperature of my room to be 60 degrees!  That is completely unacceptable.  I expected a hotel of this caliber to have a mini bar, as well as a robe and slippers.  There were none of these things.  The next morning when I went to take a shower I found a hair in the tub.  Disgusting.  The knobs to turn on the water in the shower were so tight that I had to use a wash cloth to be able to turn the knob, and it was still extremely difficult.  I turned the handle so that the water would come out of the top for a…"
5135,"The resort and hotel itself is absolutely stunning, with the perfect location on the beach. However, there are far too many “teething” problems as the management called it with staff, food and overall service. Having lived in HCMC for a number of years, we’ve visited Phu Quoc many times, always with a fantastic experience. This time as a surprise for my parents visit and wedding Anniversary. Between receiving the wrong rooms at check in, to undercooked meat at lunch in the restaurant a la carte, extremely slow/poor food and beverage service in each restaurant, and a non existent NYE “gala”, it was the worst holiday experience we’ve encountered. The majority of staff are very friendly. However they cannot communicate with guests effectively due to language barriers. Several…"
5136,"This is a very nice hotel facility.   The rooms are spacious enough, the pool and spa are beautiful, the Erva restaurant is funky, presenting a very different atmosphere for a hotel , and the food was good.   Their breakfast service staff and buffet spread were excellent.  We stayed for 3 nights and We were very disappointed in the service.   The demeanor of the reception staff is not welcoming.  We felt we were inconveniencing or annoying them when we asked that our air con be fixed  (It never was), asked for supplies like bath mats and toiletries be replenished from the day before.  The bellmen were not particular helpful or cheerful.  The expectations for excellence do not appear to be a priority at this hotel, sorry to say.  "
5137,"Lovely, stylish hotel. 2 minute walk from Alexanderplatz centre - lots of shops etc. Train station was also within a 5 minute walk of the hotel. Room was small however the bed was extremely comfortable, mirrored walls were a nice touch. Bathroom is beautiful - very spacious shower which has a frosted glass window to the bedroom - nice touch. Our room was at the side of the hotel (4th floor up) and the tram lines were directly below however you can only hear them if the window is open, when closed it is very quiet. Room was spotless and cleaned great every day! Would 100% recommend this hotel!!"
5138,"Location: When we decided to travel to Paris again, “Hotel Magenta 38” came directly in our mind (we stayed there already in July 2017), because it’s perfectly located in the trendy district of  St. Martin (2 blocks to the romantic canal), just 5 min to the Main Station Gare de’l Est (we took the TGV this time) and just 4 min to the next Metro Station. There are many hip Cafes and Bars in St. Martin to explore!  Food: The breakfast buffet got a big variety (scrambled eggs, ham, beans, croissants, pancakes, soy milk, fresh fruit, granola, joghurt) and prepared us perfectly for the day!  Room: We had a beautiful double room with a stunning view (you can spot Sacre Cœur) from our private balcony in the 5th floor! It’s definitely worth booking a room to the street (it was quiet…"
5139,We stayed at the Aston Kaanapali Villas for 2 nights via booking.com. We stayed at the Westin Maui for 7 days after and couldn't believe what a waste of money the Aston was.  Maybe we stayed in a lousy room (basic hotel room - no kitchen) but we really didn't like the vibe at this hotel. It just seemed like a sad hotel from the 80s that has been neglected. The pool should be avoided and the beach area is just OK (south of Black  Rock the beach is much better). For $250+ a night I would've expected a tad better. I think you can use your money more wisely elsewhere.
5140,"Stayed with some business associates this week and was pleasantly surprised as I had heard indifferent reports about it. Service was good, food okay, but I did like the friendly staff. Location was pretty central if you like being in West Berlin, which many don't. All in all, It is unquestionably a place I would reccommend to my freinds."
5141,I visit south France during off season  I was lucky to  have upgraded room with sea view  with little amount of money 60 euro per night more I have amazing cake with drink as complementary from the hotel for my wedding anniversary   The breakfast was really good  I will definitely recommend and visit the hotel again 
5142,"A very nice, big room (303), free breakfast in the morning, and the locatie is perfect !  The reception was helpfull and we had always a warm welcome.  There was no noice in the room.  It is fine that there is a big terrace on the first floor."
5143,"Feels like a remodeled motel 6. Rooms not kept up - cracks in base of bathroom door, bathroom dated and worn. It doesn’t feel very clean - cracking caulking in shower, marks on walls, dirt on one pillow case, smells stuffy. Feels like a old cruise ship. Only redemption is proximity to waterfront."
5144,"Last week, we went to Berlin for a school trip (3 days). We stayed at ONE80 Hostels and to be honest, I was really surprised. The hostel was modern and big enough. Our room was clean and well organized. We had enough space to drop our luggage. The bathroom was ideal. Our toilet and shower were seperated so you had enough privacy. It was large, this gave us the opportunity to get ready together.  The breakfast was small, but delicious. High quality for a hostel.   During our stay we went to the bar in the evening. It was very cosy, perfect to have a drink. There was a large selection of alcohol, but even non-alcoholic drinks, everyone was pleased.  I slept in a room of 6 and we all got a key. Normally you only get 1 or 2. This gave us the possibility to do what you want. A key…"
5145,"really nice location,in the middle of rambla. very charming balcony view on a little street in barrio gotico. apartament was not very spacious but clean and nicely furnitured. i recomend this place.very nice staff."
5146,There was no housekeeping. I called housekeeping 3 times and spoke to The concierge.  Only at 6:30 pm did someone come with a stack of towels.  He said he would be back with more. Then was crazy with dozens and dozens of packets of sugar and I would estimate 8 coffee and 6 waters.  I guess to try to make up for no service.  Very strange and not relaxing at all 
5147,"Mostly I loved the hotel. The staff are excellent and accommodating, and the hotel is so pretty. I loved the neighborhood--very quiet--though it might feel not in the center of activity for people looking for that.  My gripes might seem minor, but I'm mentioning them anyway because they detracted from the overall experience. The biggest area for improvement is the bathroom. The shower is really small and poorly designed. It has a nice rainfall shower head but because of the size of the shower, you can't escape the water either when you turn it on, or when say, you want to lather or soap up. It has a handheld, but when you switch from that to the overhead, the water comes pouring out cold for a moment.  Again, not a deal breaker but for such a nice hotel, you'd hope someone would…"
5148,"This b&b came up in a Kayak search under hotels. I selected a room at a great price. When I paid and got the confirmation email, the room description said parking. They actually sold me a parking spot; again I was in the booking a room section of Kayak. I emailed this man, and got a sarcastic, egotistical response that I obviously booked a Eric Ocasio's response was sarcastic and egotistical, he did not apologize or anything. Bottom line, don't do business with a rude inn keeper.. I've gotten better attitudes in NY! Thankfully I was in a no penalty cancellation timeframe. Just be careful, and do business with someone hospitable. Bad reflection of Chicago, and bad reflection of b&b's."
5149,"A lovely, cosy hotel, nice decor, great location, lovely breakfast in atmospheric room, exceptional value. Friendly staff, short walk from the Metro, handy supermarket, easy walk from the Gare du Nord"
5150,"Amsterdam was our second destination of the Euro trip and our agent recommended a few hotels among which we chose Mercure as it is a well-known hotel chain. Below are the details of some important aspects of the property:  1. Property and Location: The property is located around 3 minutes’ walk from the Sloterdijk Station so in terms of location, it was just great. Go to the station, purchase your ticket for Amsterdam central for Euro 3.3 one way per person or Euro 6 for a return ticket. It takes exactly 6 minutes from Sloterdijk to central station. You can also catch a train directly to / from Schiphol Airport which will cost you around Euro 5.  So you are away from the hustle and bustle of the city and just few minutes away from all the action. You will find a few eating…"
5151,"The location of this hotel was perfect for my holiday in Barcelona.  Located near all all the high end retail shops like, Gucci, Hermes... as well as walking distance to great restaurants and great sight seeing.   The hotel has doorman and large lobby the Front Desk staff are very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.  My check in was easy and we were shown to our room.  The room is adequate.  Actually quite large for a European boutique hotel room.  We did upgrade from a standard room.   The bathroom is a good size with hair dryer and flat iron,  plenty of paper products and shampoo, conditioner and soap.  The sleeping area is cramped and there is very little closet space which is located on the far wall of the room -  there is a loft with sofa, coffee maker, mini fridge,…"
5152,"The hotel is far from being clean (though it is Accor group): from the toilets to the breakfast tables full of stains at 7AM in the morning.  Besides, I had the surprise discovering a 'jade market' on the breakfast floor!!! All bedrooms doors were wide open, with people going in and out, smoking and wandering in the corridors at 7AM.  The service is pretty bad also: asking for a Coke was kind of a challenge, I asked for a shower when arriving in the morning however no bedroom was available (fully understandable because I arrived before check-out time). The problem is that the clerk re-directed me to some disgusting & stinky washroom.  I asked for the breakfast afterwards, the clerk told me that there was no breakfast. After getting angry, he told me that (of course) there was…"
5153,"This is the third time I have stayed at a Leonardo Hotel - two in Berlin in Wilmersdorf and one in Heidelberg. The hotel in Wilmersdorf is very good. Staff is professional, there is a concierge who is helpful and polite. The rooms are clean and spacious enough. Perhaps the only thing missing is that there is no refrigerator in the room.  The location is outstanding. A very short walk to U2 and U7. Also is you look at a good map Bus 109 from Tegel stops near enough to the hotel. Local restaurants across the street are outstanding. The prices are reasonable. If you want a great shwarma there is a plaae just around the corner. For an authentic German experience have lunch in the deli across the street. There is a range of fresh salads, meats, fish and stews. I had two dinners with…"
5154,"Great location, and quality.  Too bad that there is major construction noise going on all day.  I am surprised that they didn't offer something to us as compensation when we checked in.  So far our experience has been disappointing."
5156,"I’ve never received a room upgrade for the year that I’ve been a Gold member. The room had a reused welcome pamphlet on the bed that had scribbling on it, the glass to the bedroom had a hand print that was not cleaned prior to arrival, the desk chair was broken, and breakfast was mediocre."
5157,"I've stayed and lived in many hotels in the last years, but this is definitely the most welcoming and charming one! Rooms (I've seen) are small, but you immediately feel at home due to cozy design and fancy details. Super charming staff, friendly bouncer with eccentric style on Saturday evenings. I'll be definitely back very soon!"
5158,"Tried to change reservation date due to illness.  Hotel expressed that I enjoyed deep discounts through a third party reserved (I paid full price through my credit card company, not 50% through Priceline) and that my third party was the one unwilling to change.  The credit card company was perfectly cooperative! I reached supervisor Angel at the hotel who said if my card company wanted to call back she would change the date.  30 minutes later, Angel says to my card rep she was willing to change the date but not waive the penalty.  During my conversation with Angel she never once mentioned a penalty.  The penalty was proposed at over $150 which would make my already pricy reservation of $350 for one night become $500.  I have not enjoyed a discount.  I will not enjoy a stay.  I…"
5159,"I used my Marriott Rewards points to book two rooms at this hotel, which was a pain in the butt, to begin with. I requested an early check-in, a higher floor, late check-out, and rooms were supposed to be the same. I got one room as early check-in which is not a big deal but the rooms were not the same, I think one was smaller. Their excuse, they are the same type - BS. The smaller room was also on a lower floor. For the late check-out is just an hour extension and the latest they go is 4 PM but charge you a half a day. Did I mention that I have the Marriott Rewards which technically should give me some leverage. Then we go to the Hotel itself, room service comes in a bag, the elevators are a disaster, you press a button and in some elevators, they do not light up. At one point…"
5160,"4 of us stayed in one of the 2nd floor apartments.  The apartment is modern, well furnished and close to amenities.  However, it did not function as a satisfactory self catering apartment.  As soon as more than one electric appliance was used (for instance, the kettle switched on whilst the kitchen light was on!) the fuse box switch would trip!  We were not overloading the system and it did not seem as though one particular electrical appliance was faulty.  We came to the conclusion that there must be a problem with the electrics system so we attempted to contact the manager.  And thats the problem with these appartments..there is never anyone on site and no details of how to contact the management on the notice board.  We tried ringing the buzzer on the main door to the…"
5161,"I recently used all of my Marriott points to stay at this hotel for a special occasion.  It was my first stay at a Sheraton and I was disappointed because my stays at Marriotts in Europe were all nicer than this hotel.  The room itself was clean and comfortable.  However, my room looked into another building, despite my request for a sunset view.  The staff at the front desk was very helpful (especially Daniel and Anna) but they were understaffed and too busy to give specialized concierge assistance.  As a Marriott rewards member, I was not made to feel specially welcomed at this hotel.  Also, the location of the hotel made it difficult to really enjoy the city at night.  The hotel is not centrally located and after walking the city all day, it was too far to venture back for…"
5162,"Desk clerk extorted an extra $30 from us for 'extra car parking' when we stayed here during the PG&E region-wide power outage in the Bay Area.  Only 2 of our family of 4 stayed overnight at this hotel.  But on the second day, since there was no power and no hot water at our home across the bridge, two other family members drove over to the hotel for a shower and lunch.  When we returned from lunch, our room key didn't work.  We went to the front desk, and the young lady clerk said we must pay $30 dollars for our extra car parking and extra person using the room.  By the way, we reserved the room to have 2 queen beds given that as many as 4 people may need to stay during the outage.  We did not even have the extra car parked in the hotel lot when we all went out to lunch.  We explained our predicament, but the lady clerk was unapologetic and completely unsympathetic and would not issue a working room key unless we paid.  So we forked over the $30 under duress, but once the fires and power outage is over, we will certainly report this establishment to the authorities for gouging customers after a State wide emergency had been declared yesterday.  I believe this must be illegal, not mention immoral.  Unbelievable that people do this to other people in a time of area wide crisis and hardship.…"
5163,"Horrible! I would give zero stars if I could. I took my niece and nephew there on for high tea. The tea strainers at the table were used with tiny bits of leaves in them and the dishes had crumbs on it. The tea pot the waitress brought out had food stuck to the side. When she brought out our tower, some sandwiches were missing and she said - oh I need to grab you another one of this and that. Our tea service was late in the day, and I’m pretty sure they just took leftover sandwiches and desserts from other guests’ towers to make ours because the finger sandwiches were stale. We were in a hurry, so didn’t bother asking for the manager to complain about everything. After we left, my nephew asked in the car how far we were from where we were going. I asked him if he was feeling…"
5164,"As a regular visitor to the hotel for 5 years I’m saddened to see it’s fall from grace.   Room service is to the point you must request it each day.   Lobby breakfast is simply confused. English is poor, staff are tripping over themselves and the hotel is in desperate need of some TLC  The two stars were simply for location "
5165,"A friendly hotel located in the city centre, close to the luxury shops, behind the Croisette and its prestigious hotels, everything is within walking distance, I loved the wine of the owners' family served in this hotel so much, that I visited their estate near Saint Tropez, the boss' brother agreed to send me wine to Australia and now when I open a bottle at home I think of the hotel in Provence, congratulations"
5166,"Disclaimer - we stayed here using points and Im pretty sure they gave us the crappiest room they had, which was on the first floor. The floors on the first floor echos in the morning when people are checking out, so around 5-6am in the morning you hear other guests rolling their suitcase out and it echos into your room. The walls are VERY thin. The bathroom is big, but they built unnecessary walls that makes it small. Additionally, the first room we had, the shower door opened into the shower, so when you're trying to get out of the shower, you literally have to scoot out sideways. We ended up moving rooms, and that shower door opened outward... inconsistent.  So on to the main point that infuriates me - the AC. This hotel caps their AC at 22, or 23 degrees Celsius. That's about…"
5168,"Do not expect too much unless you have booked an executive room..., Standard of the rooms is more of a 2* than 4* hotel. Very dated, not so clean and the smell was rather weird. For the prices they charge (paid €300 for 3 nights)you can definitely find something with higher standards. If you’re travelling by car be prepared to pay 11€ extra for their onsite very empty parking. I’m emphasising on “very empty” as I believe this should be free for hotel guests. Get ready to activate your room key every time you leave the room as it simply gets deactivated.   On the plus side, very comfortable beds and amazing breakfast with variety of different breads, fruits, juices, croissants and fresh coffee.   Location is good with short walk to metro station.   In overall nothing special,…"
5169,"Ok, so the room is fine but I would not recommend ordering room service.  I waited almost an hour for my food, after calling basically on opening time. When my meal finally arrived, it was cold.  So I had the pleasure of calling the room service people again (which I might add they took forever to answer the damn phone). They came back to my room and asked me whether I wanted it to be remade. No I called you to confirm that my dinner was cold and that's all.  Yes I want a hot meal! I can confirm my meal is now hot"
5170,Nice hotel located at Kastanienallee in Mitte. Room was good size and very clean. No airco and busy street so noisy if you sleep with open window. There's a minibar available and drinks are not expensive. 
5172,"We spent four nights at the Sofitel and were very impressed with the quality of the hotel and the service of all of the staff.. the hotel has a very good gym if you are looking for a way to burn off the calories. My only criticism would be that for a hotel of this calibre, they should offer high quality wifi as part of the package, not on payment of an additional fee."
5173,"I booked this hotel on the recommendation of a colleague and it was the best decision I made about my trip to Paris. The hotel is small, clean, quiet, affordable and near everything you'd want to see. The staff is very helpful and Therese, the owner, knows every bus route in Paris. If you can't walk to a place, she'll tell you what bus to take and where. Breakfast was delicious. One thing: if you need hair conditioning, hair cap or anything other than a small soap and a small bottle of shampoo, bring your own. "
5174,"My husband and I stayed here, and we couldn’t have been happier with the outstanding service, location, and grotto pool that was private! All you had to do was request an hour, and you had the entire pool to yourself, for FREE! This was such a treat after a long day of walking. What other hotel can offer you a heated private pool?  The breakfast was wonderful, and the staff was nothing short of 5 star. If you are looking for a boutique hotel that offers high end service, this is your spot! We will be back! ❤️"
5175,"Where to begin? My husband and I were SO excited to stay here as we had heard nothing by dreamy recommendations of this place. We booked our long Memorial Day Weekend here months ahead of time. We checked in at about 4pm on Friday and when we asked if we could have a room with a view we were told it was a busy weekend and unfortunately nothing with a view was available. Ok we thought, well... probably the room will still be really nice so, no big deal.   We get to the room and we are literally on top of the parking lot in one direction and the public courtyard / restroom in the other direction. NOISE from both sides. Can't even open the curtains and have any natural light enter the room without seeing / being seen by the valet all day long. Not exactly the serene getaway we had…"
5176,"Stayed here for 4 nights as a base to see Barcelona. Good, clean hotel. Quite modern. Adequate breakfast. All staff that we spoke to very helpful although the WiFi wasn’t working on 7th floor, reception said they would look into but it wasn’t working throughout our stay. 5 minute walk to metro stop Llacuna (metro system here is awesome and easy to use), 10 minute walk to the beach, 15 minutes to the marina. Local area is traditional and nice, restaurants are a short walk away however we went into Barcelona most nights! Other reviews do mention the cemetery next door but we didn’t find it an issue, we actually had a walk through and it’s very pretty. There is nowhere local to exchange money so bare this in mind. Would stay here again :) would benefit from a pool but there a other…"
5177,Our first time at this hotel no tea/coffee facilities in the room also asked for a sea view but our balcony faced another building so extremely difficult to see the sea.  When asked at reception we were told that tea/coffee facilities in the room were only for prestige guests so felt penalised for being first time guests.  We've been to Madeira quite a few times staying in different hotels and always felt welcome and looked after.  Disappointed.  The location is excellent.  Just next to the fort and old town.  We chose this because of the location being on the flat as my husband isn't too good on his feet.  
5178,"Perfect location in the 15th arr with everything you need close by, including 2 stations that can get you all of Paris. Rooms were lovely and clean. Service was fantastic- staff were super helpful. Can leave luggage if you have a late flight."
5179,"Amazing hotel! Staff go above and beyond, emailing before arrival to see if you need any special requirements eg travel adaptors etc. Also such a good location and close to trains/metro that can take you direct to centre of Paris or Disney. Would 100% recommend!!"
5180,"I recently stayed 6 nights for christmas 2015. The hotel is a huge deception (as most of the hotels in RIO). The rooms are small, facilities are ageing. the hotel is simply not at the level of international standars it is not good value for money"
5181,"Where to start? Perhaps by the fact that my ID was stolen in my room by the cleaning lady. If this wasn’t enough I think that the overall management and guest relation is way below SLH standards. Nobody really cared when I complained about it until pretty much when I left the country. Then the GM took over the situation and handled it pretty well. But still..the harm was done! Staff is overall pretty incompetent. Any request took ages. A good example of that is on our first night in Riga. The hotel had chosen one of the nicest restaurant in town. They organised transportation for us too but when we got to the restaurant, it was closed. Riga is by no mean a big town and a hotel of this standard should know about restaurant opening hours (and anyway double check!)   The hotel is…"
5183,"The only positive I can think of for this hotel is that it's in a beautiful city. It ends there. Out of desperation and budget did I stay here while in town for business, if you can afford a few more dollars I would try somewhere else. This hotel is one of the worst places I have ever stayed in...from the dark, dingy halls, the wi-fi is nonexistent, even the Starbucks located in the hotel is not worth the trip. If you are reading this don't say you weren't WARNED!"
5184,"This is a fairly modern, but sterile hotel, no coziness at all.  It was clean.  There seem to be a lot of groups staying here.  The workout room was so-so, heaviest weight about 30 lbs (14kg), herd to do much with that, had a couple of machines and treadmill.  The restaurant is a large, large, sterile conference room, not very nice, the breakfast was ok for being included, wouldn’t have paid for it, there is a nice cafe next door.  So if u like a clean, but extremely boring hotel, this works.  If you want charm, this isn’t it.  Note, it is a good 1 mile+ to center of town.  It is a 20 min walk.  Gets old if u stay a few days.  However!  Great running trails, go to the TOP of the park, cross the street to the next park and pick up the running trail across university etc. I ran about 3 miles on it and turned around.... seem to continue .…"
5185,"Stayed for 4 nights at this apartment and it is perfect for any couple wanting a short visit in Barcelona. Rooms were comfortable, clean and well equipped, Metro 2 mins away, Bus 3 mins away, Train station 5 mins away and plenty of food options. Although the street is busy and lively, you don't here much at night and the beds were very comfortable. Satellite TV didn't function at all otherwise would be 5 stars."
5186,We had a junior suite facing the street - clean and well presented but incredibly noisy during the week with heavy construction happening across the road from 8.00am to 7.00pm. When we asked to be moved to the back of the hotel we were told there were no junior suites on that side.  You should also note that the hotel is quite a walk from the old town. The staff are friendly and generally helpful but I feel it's better suited to business travellers.  The breakfast buffet is excellent.
5187,"There was vomit and/or blood clearly visible and splattered next to the toilet in our room.  When I called the front desk, the only offer was to send someone to clean it up.  No offer to change our room because they were full.  Makes me question what else is missed during cleaning....severely disturbing at a place like this.  Likely will NOT be returning....."
5188,I was shocked at how unaccommodating and unfriendly the staff at the front desk and restaurants are. I had to call 3x to get my room cleaned and it was still not done. Never coming back to this property !  Overpriced and somewhat outdated given the price. 
5189,"The hotel's claims and the reviews of others led me to expect a very high-quality experience, but it was simply very average and probably not a good value for this price. I'm relieved this trip wasn't for a honeymoon or other especially meaningful event. Rating is only a 3 instead of a 2 because of how the hotel responded to my problems and the really nice view.  First room was a standard room (which I booked) and had very loud noise from the heavily-used road right outside the door. For a 5-star luxury hotel on an island, this is unacceptable for any room. Also, the wifi in this room did not work at all. Zero. I could connect, but nothing at all would load.  After letting the front desk know my frustrations, they offered to upgrade to a superior room further from the road on…"
5190,"This hotel has a definite 19th Century style with prints of old masters on the walls, solid wooden furniture and a four poster bed. Our room was on the corner with an outlook over the street. We arrived at the nearby Berlin Nordbahnhof train station and it was a short walk from the station to the hotel. The room has a high ceiling and feels spacious and airy. Breakfast is served in the downstairs Neumond café, which is not part of the hotel but is linked by a staircase from the first floor of the hotel. This is a hotel of character and a fun place to stay."
5191,"Yes, the only good thing about this hotel is that its situated opposite the infamous Copacabana beach, so you have a view of the beach from the window.  Yes, room has a clean bed and bathroom.  But thats about it  The problems :-  1. Internet is super slow. So in case you want to watch you tube, instagram stories etc, its impossible.  2. There is just too much noise. If you are an allergic to noise, this hotel is not for you. There is too much noise both from the road ( I was on the 10th floor) and from the alleyway adjoining rooms via other guests as rooms are in very close proximity.  3. No complimentary water bottles provided in the room despite the room costing almost 175 usd/night  4. The AC works on a fixed temperature, which is extremely cold. So if you want to bring it…"
5193,Our third visit and this hotel still ticks all the boxes. Spotless rooms and common areas. A nice little bar to relax in post tourist activities. Multiple Metro and bus connections within an easy walk. Lecole Militaire and Champ du Mars are a close walk. Amazing staff as well. Will definitely return.
5194,"Beautiful architect, good experience of cable car and cool weather.  Very potential to make this hotel better by improving associates’ altitude, smiling, Food is just average and below, you have no choice to eat here."
5195,"I've been three times in Brasil in 4 months, and I wanted to try this hotel on the Barra beach. The structure itself is new and well designed, but it's mainly the form. The substance in hotels is made by the rooms, and the service you get while you are there. The rooms (in terms of size, furniture, view) are more or less the same level I had in other hotels in Rio, nothing especially either good or bad to say about it (some unpleasant night noise from the frigo bar). Breakfast buffet was reach but not carefully looked after, so every morning something was finished and not replaced (fruit or pan de queso or coffee).  So was the service, generally speaking: I had to ask twice to get a laundry bag, and again twice to have my clean laundry back. But major point is the daily…"
5196,"I wish I could give 0 stars. Probably the worst place I've stayed in the US, in terms of cleanliness. I went to sleep in a white t-shirt, and the next morning while I am brushing my teeth, I see a large bed bug crawling on my chest. Thankfully, we were able to get another hotel (I was traveling for work), but now several days later I am covered in red welts. Not to mention I had to put all of my clothes in the dryer immediately after I got home, and days after washing them I am living in constant paranoia that there is a bug infestation in my apartment.  To top it off, the woman at the front desk NEVER apologized once. When we went to speak with her she was very confrontational, because Expedia had called and mistakenly told her we already checked out (we were in the process of…"
5197,"Absolutely the WORST hotel experience of my 30+ years of travel. I booked two rooms in January for an April trip. Upon arrival we were told one room was ready, one was not. They lied. There was no room. And we didn't find this out until we inquired an hour later. I had all the documentation, including my credit card statement and the hotel's confirmation email. The woman at the desk was the rudest I have ever met. No sense of customer service at all. No manager was on duty (late afternoon) and it took over an hour to get a front desk manager in on the conversation. The hotel did not have the second room available. I tried to resolve this situation with every scenario possible at the front desk, since the woman clearly was incapable of saying anything other than ""we do not have a…"
5199,"Based on the high amount of positive reviews, we were excited to stay at this hotel. However, besides the really attentive staff, our expectations were not met. The room that we were initially assigned had a tremendous smell of moisture / aircon, so we were moved to another room, which however had the same problem, though not that bad. the rooms themselves are relatively old and in bad shape, which is also reflected in the detail cleanliness, e. g. in the shower drain / corners. Worst point about the room is the music system which can not be turned off (frontdesk sent an engineer, but no fix) and leaves a constant humming noise throughout the night. Aircon is noisy. The rooms are not well isolated and you will be able to hear the neighbors / floor talk. Worse again was the…"
5201,We like to move around when we go on holiday so tend to book half our stay in a good hotel in one place and then end our trip in a posh hotel someplace else... this was the good hotel option and you know what is was good.... perfectly comfortable and helpful staff.... breakfast was average but fine. If you looking for good value and don't want 5 star it is not a bad choice
5202,"You stay here because of the BEST location right in the center of Berlins gay area. Small hotel, with friend staff and comfy rooms/beds. Breakfast buffet and rooms was a bit smaller than I expected. Didnt hear any street noice, had a great Night sleep."
5203,This place I over priced and smelly! My friends and I stayed here! It was horrible! The room was dirty and smelled old. The air didn’t work! Our door broke the second night there. We wasted four hours waiting for people to come fix! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!
5204,"we literally didn't have enough room for our suitcases. not to mention the bathroom is encased in glass and open on top so you better be comfortable with each other. otherwise clean rooms and good service, good location"
5206,"After reading all the wonderful reviews about this hotel I was really excited, but after getting there, I must say, I don't get it.  The island is gorgeous and this hotel could be magnificent, but it needs some creature comforts to take it to the next level.  1) Bed Linens - The ones on the bed were very low thread count and were very itchy. 2) Pillows - Very Cheap Polyester with no support at all. 3) Bed - Very thin mattress, not much support. 4) Windows - Staff kept opening the windows every day when they cleaned (and left them open) and let in a multitude of mosquitoes and other insects. 5) Climate Control - Only worked when you had your key in the slot at the door which meant that you usually returned to a hot, bug infested room. 6) Location - While beautiful, not near the…"
5207,For the money that my wife and I spent for two nights we expected more. The pictures make it look it look better than it really is. The room was so small that you could hardly walk around the bed to get to the bathroom. The breakfast was horrendous and you can get better continental breakfast at a cheaper hotel. I would not recommend this place to anyone. The only plus about this place is the short distance to Wrigley. We'll Uber from a better hotel next time.
5209,"This hotel has a few great aspects. It's quiet, even though it's located near a busy street in a busy part of town. Whoever designed the renovations really paid attention to detail. It's walking distance to metro, as well as several tourist sites like the cathedral. Breakfast in hotel is expensive and time consuming (and formal) , but there are a dozen places within 5 minute walk which charge 1/3 of the hotel breakfast price. There's no fitness center in the hotel, but I used the free vouchers to get to an excellent health club, which is about 5 minutes away. I even took a yoga class there in Spanish. Beds are comfortable and rooms are good sized for Europe. My only complaint is around the front desk staff. They weren't knowledgeable about where to go to catch trains, and gave…"
5210,"I travel a lot for business and pleasure.   Some hotels are grande and others not so.  Rarely do you find a hotel that you are reluctant to leave for the day and excited to get back to.  I could write many, many great thing about the Sir Savigny Hotel in Berlin but I honestly believe that will ruin your surprise.  Do yourself a favour and stay here on your visit to Berlin  And if you are like me, it will be very easy just to not go outside the hotel at all.   Enjoy"
5211,"We enjoyed our stay in Porto and  we  really liked the location and ambiance of the hotel. The fittings are very nice and the blending of original stone materials along with rusted steel  look to stairs  was well done. The rooms were ok as, mentioned in other reviews, the front rooms had a bit of  street noise and were a little compact for what was purported to be superior rooms.   A couple of hints, parking to unload at the hotel was extremely challenging when arriving by personal car as we did. We had difficulty in finding a spot, and ended up parking on the median, others we were travelling with parked in the bus stop, others on the sidewalk. As we observed over the next two days, everyone seems to park everywhere, signs don't  mean anything while you are unlading. The…"
5212,"Rooms are big, but they are cold. If you have noisy next door guest, you will hear it for sure. Remember to take ear plugs with you. Location is quite convenient, close to pearl market. Price level is reasonable, but I would not stay if I had to pay."
5213,"A bright and airy hotel located off the main road by a courtyard.Plenty of small cafe's and restaurants in surrounding district. Quiet, comfortable and clean rooms and pleasant public areas. Staff friendly and efficient,"
5214,"I was excited to book a weekend in Chicago with my husband. When we arrived, the first room we were assigned had long, black hair all over the bathroom sink, floor, and shower. It was evident that the bathroom had not been sanitized or clean. As someone with a background in hospitality, I understand these things happen. We went back downstairs and asked if we could change rooms. We went to our second room only to find that it was located in the elevator lobby (literally) and was a handicapped room with the cabinets thrown open and the furniture beginning to brake. We went down a THIRD time. We spoke with a different guest agent each time, and the third agent was absolutely horrible. She was rude and aggressive without listening to our concerns. We were finally reassigned to a third room, which was the worst of all in terms of cleanliness. The floors had not been vacuumed and had food and crumbs everywhere. The sheets had rips and tears in them and should have been retired a long time ago. The worst part is how deceiving online photos are. The furniture is broken and aged. The photos are not accurate representations. At this point, my husband and I had wasted an hour and a half of our one-night getaway in line and speaking with the front desk. We dumped our stuff in the filthy room, arrived back after midnight, woke up as early as possible and checked out. This was a HORRIBLE experience, a WASTE of time, and I will never return to this hotel.    Keep in mind, a friendly guest agent, sending a housekeeper back to our original room, and maybe a free breakfast would have been enough to remedy the situation THE FIRST TIME. The problem was on top of poor cleaning, they had poor customer service, and were even worse at deescalating the situation. By the third time, I was ready to walk out.…"
5215,"We come to Paris at least 4x a year to see family and friends. And we've decided this will be the place we'll stay. This hotel was lovely. Our room was bigger than we'd imagine it would be, really comfy bed and linens, the shower was great,  amenities were aplenty. The spa was really nice and we made use. The staff were very polite. Our only issue is that the night porter took a while to answer the front door when it was late but he did humbly apologise. I can't wait to come back."
5216,"If you want to book a neat, beautiful and lovely hotel, Bagues would be one of your best choices in Barcelona. it is located in downtown with a good access to shopping area, Mediterranean sea and metro network. Rooms with La Rambla street view are better but if you want to have more silent room, ask for rooms with church view. The staff are very nice and friendly."
5217,"Worst customer service I have ever experienced. As a family of 4 (2 kids) We had been traveling all day and just wanted to get a good nights sleep, so headed to our room (506) at 8pm to find the Air Con did not work, we called front desk to inform them. Told someone will be up, but after an hour we had to call again, they eventually sent up a young guy that knew nothing about air con, he messed around with the settings but not being able to solve the issue,  then said he needed to go downstairs to get something and will be back. 30 minutes passed and no sign of him, I went down to front desk to be told that the guy claimed he had fixed it, which contradicted what he had told us about returning. I asked to be moved room, but instead front desk decided to send up the security…"
5218,"There were some things that were 5 star and some things that were 1 star, so in the middle at 5 star.  I stayed for 7 nights and I am very warm-blooded and I like to sleep in a cold room. The rooms of this hotel are built inside an historic building, so they don't have windows to the outside of the building to open to get fresh air. As a matter of fact, you can't open any windows. So, they have air-conditioning. Unfortunately, the air system only goes to 20 C (68 F). It allows you to turn it down to 18 C (64 F), but the system goes off when it gets to 20 C. I complained numerous times and they were unable to fix it.   I slept terribly and engineering could not address my issue.  I think 20C / 68F is probably good for most.  I will note they don't have a gym/fitness center but…"
5220,"Helpful staff, more than ample breakfast to take care of my (Keto) diet.   Beds were comfortable and the rooms quiet.   I tried two different rooms as I was sharing the first night then moved... both were good. "
5221,"I did not intent to stay here, but stopping by train on my way to visit friends, I gave it a try and asked for a walk-in rate! Room was simple but clean and had all I needed. Very affordable it was tempting so I did stay for a night and it was really good and easy to sleep and have breakfast. Breakfast was okay and nice serviced by some Ladies who really care about the guests. The area is okay not in the center but close to very thing by bus and train right in front of the Hotel. Definitely a good choice to stay."
5222,The rooms are tiny and the bathrooms are old and outdated.  They have the old tiny toilets that you can hardly sit on.  There is no sink space for your toiletries.  The closet had no hangers and the coffee dispensers were missing the coffee.  The first room we received was on the sixth floor overlooking the rusted fire escape with a view of the air conditioning in the background.  You had to look through the peeling wooden window to see it.  The TV was having computer problems and breaking up.  The elevators were made for three people only and were slow and outdated.  The only nice thing about the hotel was the rooftop bar which was closed the entire time we were there.  It was supposed to be the highlight of the trip and they failed to mention it was under repair.  The hall…
5224,Had a great stay at the Hyperion. Good location and good connection to both the airport and city centre. Great room and slept very well. We found the breakfast too expensive but there are plenty of good cafés in the neighbourhood.
5226," We stayed for 11 nigjts. The hotel is at the top of a steep hill .it is a very clean and comfortable hotel . The rooms were spacious, kept very clean but sea facing rooms had very small balcony's .The food quality was very good but repetitive and I found it bland and  lacking in flavour.  The  hotel staff were welcoming and friendly but the Tui sensimar reps especially Micael were excellent, they tried hard with all activities offered and were very inclusive. The downside was the size of the pool area which was very cramped with too many veds around it.I felt a bit like a sardine squashed! You are unable to move your bed to follow the sun. The noise from the building works behind was terrible, the pile driving into the rock was constant from 10-6pm .This part is now stopped! We…"
5227,Been here since Thursday.  Was actually quite happy with the hotel until I arrived back from a wedding and was locked out of my room.  Came down to front desk and they claimed there was no card on my file. Concerning because I did give my card at check-in (they wouldn't have checked my in otherwise).  They played it off as if it was my fault.    Wouldn't recommend this hotel.  Stay anywhere else if you care about your card security and decent customer service.
5228,"Hotel Curious was a very unique experience in Barcelona -- just off Las Ramblas tucked away on a tiny street.  The hotel staff was very attentive and responsive and the breakfast offerings were good fuel to get your day started.  Our room was tiny -- two steps to the bathroom and the other person had to climb over you to get out of the bed as it was tucked against the wall with very limited space to walk around it.  The view was of a wall across the alley though there was a balcony affording fresh air which we appreciated.  We loved the fact it was walking distance to public transportation and centrally located in the city.  The price was reasonable, the rooms were very clean and I would stay there again! "
5229,"Enjoy the hotel for the location and reputation. Unfortunately, repair was being done when I am trying to sleep from jet lag.  Horrible situation.  Checked out earlier and had to change all plans.  No more Sofitel"
5231,"It was a fine hostel but we did not understand the hype. We booked after reading a lot of good reviews, especially about the nice staff. After our stay we can definitely tell you it’s not worth the expense. It’s a bit pricy for being a simple hostel. Around 53 reais per night. No breakfast, no towels. Since we booked through a different site than the other people in our dorm we did not get breakfast included. This is just a silly rule, we all payed the same amount but the guys who booked through booking.com (instead of Hostelworld) got to eat. To me that’s just silly. But they told us nothing could be done.  Other inconvenience: you can’t use the kitchen until 11 am. So you have to count in the extra expense for buying breakfast at a restaurant or the hostel. The rooms are small…"
5232,"The experience of arriving by boat through the Mekong delta area jungle was certainly unique. The staff was friendly and nice. Pickup/dropoff was easy and helpful.  That said, I have a lot of issues with this place.  I chose this partly based on the location shown on booking.com to be close to the floating markets . The problem is, the location they show on the booking.com site is not actually the location of the villa, but of the pickup point where they pick you up in a very rickety boat with no life jackets (see attached photo for difference in location). We are all strong swimmers but I can't help but wonder what would happen if one was not. You're then transported 30 minutes away by boat (30 minutes farther from the floating markets) to the Villa where you're effectively a captive audience. You can't go anywhere else to eat and you can't take any tours other than the ones they provide. Both the food and the tours were overpriced for what they were. We paid $8 per person for a dinner that was basically fried chicken legs, some spring rolls and green beans. By Vietnamese standards that's a huge rip-off as we ate multi course meals in some rather nice restaurants all over Vietnam for much less. Similarly with the tours. Other reviewers have mentioned the ""free bikes"" but there are no maps or any way to figure out how to get around on your own so we opted for the bike tour. At $15 a person that's basically paying the tour guide the equivalent of several days' salary ($60) in Vietnam for taking us around on the free bikes for 3 hours. Similarly with the $25 floating market tour - in Saigon we took $25 a head motorcycle food tours (with 4 drivers) that included food at 5 restaurants/stands. This was a ride in a rickety boat where we had to pay for fruit/coffee etc. and it seemed like the staff were getting fruit kickbacks from the vendors. Overall, our assessment was that this is a ""homestay"" without soul - the owner apparently lives in Paris and it's clear that it's a profit maximizing business rather than a real homestay. We enjoyed the Delta region but would not return here.…"
5233,"This is the worst hotel I have ever been in. Stained sheets, floors and counters, stained carpets, smeared, dirty walls, broken outlets, bugs, the list goes on. Do not be fooled by the newly refurbished lobby, 1 step onto a floor and you will understand the extent of the problem. "
5234,"We are a group of 10 people stayed in the hotel May 30 - June 03. The rooms are very large,nice and well maintained. I had booked my room for 3 adults and confirmed the Executive Suite with 1 king bed & 2 single bed. When we arrive at 1:00 AM to found that the excutive suite with 1 king bed and 2 sofas with blankets & pillows ( not sofa bed or pull  out couch or rollaway beds). I went back to the front desk and was told that they considered the sofas as a bed and they did not have any other rooms open so 2 of us had to slept on the small uncomfortable sofas.  1 of our friend went to visit another friend for 1 hour and returned to her room to found that her I Phone and Canon Camera was missing. She reported to the front desk and was told that they did not see any thing on the…"
5235,They stole my Apple Watch!  I stayed here for one night because my fiance was taking his exam near by. We saw the review of the hotel so we were already worried but we thought its only one day so no big deal. When I checked out at 12 pm and I had several hours to kill till he got finished with his exam. So I decided to allow the front desk to hold my items. I had them hold it from 12 - 4pm so about 4 hrs.  As I had them hold my luggage I thought since I am traveling alone to the mall I would put all my belongings in my luggage. There was a lady that took my luggage in and when I picked it up it was a male who brought it out to me. To be honest it doesn't mean it was one of them because the bags sat in their back room for 4 hrs. Plus there are other people that go in there and…
5237,"I’ve been to a couple of Hilton hotel in different cities and I like them all, but this one is disappointing.  Non-smoking room is filled with heavy smell of smoke.  Hygiene problem of its resto is unbearable.  My experience is the waitress simply replace the table mat without cleaning the table, with all the sauces/food debris underneath the new mat still... "
5238,"Enjoyed the location but was surprised to see an additional $112 added to my four-night stay for a Guest Amenity Fee for ""amenities"" that I never used. Booked through Hyatt, there is no mention of the fee while booking (I prepaid in May) or in email confirmation. Seems sketchy to add after the fact."
5239,"We stayed at this Grand Mercure hotel at Copacabana beach with the expectation of receiving hotel rooms and services similar to the other Grand Mercure hotels globally. The rooms were small and poorly finished. The standard room comprised a very small space and poorly appointed bathroom that lacked the most basic of amenities. The table in the room, while present, was scratched and looked like a carpenters work bench in a poor managed workshop.   There is a very small swimming pool on the Terrace level, more like a dipping pond that can comfortably accommodate not more than 4 persons at one time, but only for wading and definitely not for swimming. The deck alongside the pool is more like a short strip allowing for few chairs. The service for a few drinks and starters took way…"
5240,"Stayed at this hotel for Xmas markets, was ideally located as markets were 15-30 min walk away. Rooms basic but lived up to expectations, slightly odd lay out, doors everywhere and twin beds were a bit uncomfortable bit as I said was what we expected so no complaints. Staff were helpful and polite, taxi ordering is done at the press of a button with the taxi turning up within 3 minutes even at 5am. Would recommend this hotel as an affordable base for anyone exploring Alexanderplatz and the Xmas markets."
5241,"We like a variety of holiday experiences. In recent years we have enjoyed all-inclusive stays with Barcelo and HD Hotels in the Canaries, which have been perfect for a young family. The Vila Gale has great facilities, a good location and a much higher price tag than it's Spanish rivals, so should have been able to deliver a package to match, but was severely let down by lack-lustre staff and abysmal entertainment for adults and kids alike.  The Good  The hotel is stylish in every respect, from the rooms, to reception, dining and bar areas. Our top floor room in the central block provided a nice sea view. The pool is attractive, an excellent size and depth for growing kids and adults to share harmoniously. Importantly, there is no overcrowding and never a problem getting sunbeds…"
5245,"Billed as an apartment hotel, I was somewhat hesitant upon arrival.  However, from the moment I arrived until the moment I departed, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.  The reception was small but welcoming, the rooms (studio in set-up with a small kitchen area etc.) were very comfortable and well appointed.  The adjoining bar had a very friendly feel and the breakfast buffet was extremely well laid-out and plentiful.  best of all, the room rate was only 79 Euros for a pay-in-advance booking.  Without doubt, I will be back."
5246,"Stayed only one night on Nov 15. 1st Hotel on a 6 day tour, room was on the 7th floor, good size room, bed is comfortable but there is no adjustment on the room temperature, there's a dial but you can turn it all the way up or down, nothing happen, gets very warm in the middle of the night"
5247,"Plenty of room for our family (four person), friendly staff, nice rooms and good kitchen. Subwaystation and food market nearby. On the minus side, there was not proper air condition. Thanks! We recommend this apartment."
5248,"I arrived late one evening for a short business trip. I had no problem in finding somewhere to eat close by even at 11.00 p.m. on a Sunday. The room was very comfortable with a great view over the street. The breakfast buffet was adequate but not very exciting and in rather a dingy room. Though the address of the hotel is Oranienburgerstrasse, it is nearer to Oranienburgertor U-bahn station than to Oranienburgerstrasse S-bahn station. The location is excellent, with the Reichstag, Brandenburgertor, etc. within easy walking distance. The cost of the room was very reasonable for the location.  PLUS POINTS: Location, price, room MINUS POINTS: Breakfast. So more plus than minus. I'd stay here again if visiting somewhere in the city centre."
5249,I would rate this a 0 stars but I don't know how to. This hotel has ruined my stay here at San Francisco. I have never heard of a hotel with no air conditioner. I'm sitting here it's 3am and I can't sleep I'm suppose To drive 7 hours back to my house on zero sleep instead of this being a nice weekend with my family it's the worst I've ever had I will never stay in any best western 
5250,"I was in San Francisco for a conference and I checked in to this hotel on November 30th and checked out on December 2nd.  I checked in using my personal credit card to guarantee the room at which point they authorized $989.92 for my two night stay (nightly rate of $269).  Fine.  When I checked out, I used my company card to pay the total bill of $626.46.    I travel quite a bit and am familiar with the need to authorize a card and was expecting the 'hold' on my personal card to drop off within a week or so.  It is now December 14th and after calling and leaving 3 messages with no response, they are still holding the $989.92.    I would appreciate if someone from the hotel would return my call and let me know when this hold will be released."
5251,"The actual stay and hotel was alright. Pretty standard room with standard service. However, upon checkout they tacked on another $50+ as a ""city charge"" to my prepaid booking through TripAdvisor. I explained that when I booked, it very explicitly said that was my final price and there would be no more fees. I even showed a manager the screenshot and got nowhere. I would've been fine paying the fee if it was mentioned during booking, but I'm not a fan of bait and switches or hidden fees."
5252,"We had booked a short break in Berlin, it was a cheap offer so we didn't expect much. On arrival at 23:00 the staff were helpful and courteous. The hotel looked clean and tidy. We went to our room on floor 6, take care the signage is a bit misleading. The room was clean, tidy, compact and served our needs. Breakfast was included in the price, the dining room was lovely, bright and well staffed. The buffet was kept stocked with tasty breakfast items and the staff busied themselves about tending to the guests needs. The hotel is just a 10 minute walk from the nearest station which is well served by S & U bahn trains. You are just 10 -15 minutes from the city centre by u bahn. We thoroughly enjoyed this hotel and would recommend to anyone wishing to visit Berlin."
5254,We stayed here over a busy period. Here’s my main points   Good bits  1) amazing front desk staff. Great concierge who hooked us up with a wonderful city guide (see my review on Mbrandsford Rio for more details)  2) lovely breakfast and beautiful breakfast room with great service.  Coffee plentiful and attentive staff ensure you need nothing at all  3) location. Slightly less dangerous than the rest of Rio  4) bathrooms are well designed  5) great view from the pool and from the sea facing rooms   Bad bits  1) food in the lobby and pool area hit and miss at best. Takes ages. Not reliable.  2) rooms. Small. Noisy. Dark - badly lit. Dated. Philip Stark 1990’s - quite old hat now.  The lower floor rooms are extremely loud.  3) foyer gets a bit chaotic with partygoers especially at…
5255,"Stay December 13-18  I had to a total of 5+ rooms as every room was filthy and disgusting (see photos) Room 1 - feces smeared on shower curtain and old washcloth left on shower rod. Drain didn't work and tub filled with water up to my ankles making for a slippery dangerous tub. Room 2 - ""sticky ball"" toy with hair left next to bed and hair on bathroom counter Room 3 - was not asked if I needed two beds and they tried giving me a room with 1 bed   Room 4 - another dirty shower curtain and was promised a corner room and it wasn't a corner room  Room 5 - was a very cold room as heat couldn't keep up with the amount of windows, overlooking construction.  The room also didn't have a working tub as the drain didn't work and filled with water up to ankles again - causing a slippery…"
5256,"Summary  1. We group of 10 corporate travellers. My room 334 during stay (just to let u know it is not fake or payed review) 2. Bad Hospitality during stay. 3.

5257,"Great smaller boutique hotel, excellent location, staff most warm and welcoming eager and enthusiastic to assist. Rooms very comfortable, nicely equipped, tastefully furnished. All round great place to stay and rest. Hotel less than five minutes walk (with case) to Luxembourg station (RER Line B to / from CDG and Orly airports), five minutes in opposite direction is nearest Metro station (Cluny la Sorbonne). Less than ten minutes easy stroll will see you on the doorstep of a whole plethora of restaurants, bars to breakfast, coffee, wine and dine or just have a glass of wine and people watch; catering for every taste (my Lady vegetarian - not a problem).'Almost perfect hotel' if you want to be staying in the lap of luxury - this hotel is not for you; however, if you want to stay…"
5258,"My wife, daughter and I stayed at this hotel for 7 nights.  We expected a small room by Paris standards and therefore we were not surprised with a triple room that was the size of a North American bedroom (10' X 13').  All aspects of our stay at this hotel exceeded our expectations.  The room had a good WIFI reception, the AC worked well, the TV worked great and the location was near 2 large grocery stores, a few smaller food stores and 3 bakeries.   On Fridays there is an open market to purchase vegetables, fruit and small gift items.  In terms of location to the Paris downtown, you are only approx. 6 subway stations or 20 minutes.  In terms of safety, this is a quiet area and I never felt unsafe and the streetscape is quite pleasant.  A key factor in this location is the hotel…"
5259,"Our room was very clean and pleasant, comfy bed and excellent city view. The location is good- right next to Rosenthaler metro station. The stuff wasn't very nice and kind, and the elevator was broken for two days so it was not much fun taking the stairs to the 6th floor. "
5260,Just back from Berlin having spent 5 nights at this cracking and slightly funky hotel. Both myself and my wife loved this place. We stayed in room 506 - a suite with a free standing bathtub in the bedroom.  Bed was really comfy. Room was large and tastefully decorated. Toiletries were wonderful. Walk in shower. Can't fault anything. Staff friendly and accommodating.Hotel located in city's west end in district of Charlottenburg - lovely restaurants and shops nearby. The local S Bahn station ( Savignyplaz) is a two minute walk away providing great links to all the sights in the city - although not a direct link to Schoenefeld airport. If we visit Berlin again would definitely stay here again. I would highly recommend Sir Savigny! 
5261,"Where do I start? The beds were tiny, the walls are paper thin, they never told me that the showers were at the complete other end of the hallway, along with the bathroom. This place was a complete nightmare. Avoid this at all costs"
5262,"We made a reservation 6 months in advanced, we want to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. We pay more than 500 dollars for the best room and the best view, but instead for the same price they give us that room called junior suite in the corner with windows from ceiling to floor, but they give us the lowest room of the hotel. Our view was walls and nothing else. We talk to the receptionist and she wasn't friendly at all. Then we speak with the manager and she couldn't do anything about. We ended in a simple room that it is not in the corner. Some view but not a great one. They have in their web site that junior rooms for the same price even the lowest floors with no views, just walls blocking the city and bay views. We were so disappointed that we didn't enjoy our stay. Be…"
5263,"This hotel is composed of 2-3 buildings joined together. My self and few colleagues checked in. They got sea facing rooms, which were not bad at all. I got a room in Building B. This room was not facing sea and the quality of the room was worse then Motel 6. Sub standard room with torn chair and looked that the room was just put together by using cheap and shoddy material. Do not be fooled by attractive rates, unless you get a sea facing room, other wise you will end up in the awful Building B and suffer. Location is big plus just cross the road and you are on the Copacabana Beach. Very so so and crowded breakfast room."
5264,"I made reservations for a Friday/Saturday night stay on the web site.  Had an Ocean Front King room confirmed.  Upon arrival was told I'd been assigned the ""family suite"" room, instead.  I asked if it was ""ocean front"" and was told, ""Oh, it has a living room, a bath...and the ocean view will be from the bedroom.""  This room is located on the 3rd floor, but overseeing the roof of a house and the ocean view blocked by the Hotel's sun deck.  It was ""old and tired""...the heater didn't work until my wife lit the pilot light.  There was no balcony on which we love to sit and read...and it was generally a disappointment.  So...if you book a room, be prepared for their reassignment.  We won't return."
5266,"It cost 60 euros and around 30 mins to get from the airport to hotel. Staff were friendly, rooms were very spacious, we stayed on the ground floor. Hotel has a gym, breakfast was mediocre.  Location is really good, exit the hotel...turn left 10 minute walk and your on the marina, there's also a stop there for the hop on/hop off tour bus. Lots of gyros/kebab places around to eat, we opted for paella at the marina which was to die for.  Rooms were clean, we were greeted with a glass of sparkling wine which was a nice touch. Evening time we came back the hotel at 4am in the morning after a night out...everything starts late there, and there was a dedicated member of staff of night shift which helped."
5268,"We have used the Crown Promenade on numerous occasions with difficulty in obtaining acknowledgement responses regarding our Corporate Company Credit Card Authority Letter. On three separate bookings over the previous year, on check-in, our travellers have been denied the authority to utilise the original Corporate Credit Card form which is issued on company letterhead. After many telephone calls, eventually the authority has been accepted."
5269,"Stayed this hotel twice.  In July 2019 and this week (Sep 2019).  I would give it 3.5 star on my first trip but 2 star on my recent business trips.  The facilities are old but I could still tolerate it but it deteriorated so much this time it that it is bothering me: 1. Room towels are not clean. I discover by accident on my first night and upon closer subsequent inspection, I discover the towels are indeed not properly cleaned before placed into guest room. Happens every night. 2. Napkins in Blooms (breakfast cafe) are also dirty when I decided to inspect them. It seems being cycled without being clean if it is slightly used.  Are the staffs taking short cuts to hygiene? 3. Reservations team intentionally charge my stay and meals at my home country currency on credit card…"
5270,"We stayed overnight because we were going to a baby shower the next day.  We thought this was going to be a lot better than it was.  It looks ok from the outside, but when  you get to the room it's nothing special.  The bed was not comfortable and there was a lot of noise coming in from the halls and outside.  Children in the halls talking loud and also playing in the pool and screaming until10 that night.  Of course we weren't far from the pool, but it would have been nice if they got out earlier.  It wasn't real inexpensive either.  You are definitely not going to have a fun couples night there because you feel like everyone is in your room with you...  When we were waiting to get a receipt in the morning the girl at the desk ignored us and then helped someone who just walked…"
5271,The hotel is situated a bit outside Funchal takes approximately 20 mins by bus. The hotel is clean and staff helpful and friendly. WE had a superior room which was large with a balcony . The balcony was not very private as the dividing wall only went half way down in addition the higher rooms were looking down on you. It had a kitchenette facility which was equipped for 3 people. There was only 3 of everything plates knifes etc.WE only used the fridge and a microwave appeared on the second week of our holiday.   The hotel is situated on a cliff edge and swimming pools and sunbathing areas are situated at different levels. During the day the bar was situated at the top of several flights of stairs . There were no real other facilities for drinks snacks etc. THis was very poor.…
5273,"The woman on the front desk was helpful and friendly, the room was clean and comfortable (no smoker smell that often pervades hotel rooms) and the hotel was quiet so it was possible to get a decent night's sleep.     "
5274,"Very nice small hotel , very good location near to metro statuon; nice rooms , nice staff; reasonable price range ; breakfast are good ; i think it is good place to stay if you need to stay in centre of the city"
5275,"When I got to the room (707) windows and ceiling were vibrating!!! Seemed like there was a constant train passing by the room. I called the reception to ask for another room and they said they were fully booked. When i asked the reason for the vibration the reception said they didn""t know but When i probed if anybody had complained before they said that ""half of people complain about the vibrating windows but other half doesn't"". As it was impossible for a human being to sleep in that room i went to the front desk to inform i was leaving the hotel they told me that they would still charge the room as this was hotel policy.  Worst experience i had in a hotel by far. "
5276,"This was the third Motel One I stayed in Berlin and I already knew what to expect. The hotel seems brand new and is nicely decorated. The room, though small, was just perfect for a 3-night stay. It was super clean and quiet. Despite being next to the railway trucks, I could not hear anything. This is thanks to the two double-glazed windows the rooms have. As already mentioned, the rooms are carefully decorated and and leave you a pleasant feeling. The only thing that could have been better, I would have loved some more toiletries and maybe a mini-bar in the room. The hotel is very well situated, just a couple of minute away from the railway station and the main shopping street. Last but not least, the hotel stuff is very helpful and kind, and above all very professional. The stuff at the reception left me a very good impression when I reported a problem with the air-conditioning in my room, and they immediately offered me a solution. I would definitely recommend for a great value-for-money in Berlin.…"
5277,"First of all, the staff at the Wittmore was the friendliest ever. All of them are supernice and helpful. Great job from all of you!  The hotel has a courtyard with a small restaurant and bar.   On the rooftop there are sunbeds and a small pool (not for swimming). Breakfast is preferrably taken here. Maybe lunch as well.  So why only rated a four? The light! Difficult to see where to put the key when entering the room. Difficult to pack your bag unless you put it on the bef. Finally, the bathroom need more light - difgicult to make a proper make-up."
5278,"We were in the hotel for one night for a wedding. Check in was quick and easy. I booked a executive suite. My sister booked an executive room. What’s the difference you ask, money and a wood floor. Not what I expected. The bathrooms are old and need to be remodeled. When we went to check out at 2:30, the manager of the front desk area, tall thin man and no personality said the computer noted a 2 pm check out. We were told we had a 3 pm. We gave him the name of the person who told us we could check out at 3 pm. With a smirk on his face, he sarcastically said no problem. We stood in line for 15 minutes to check out. Only one person at the front desk with a trainee. There were only 2 people in front of me. Poor service though the young lady was very nice. It was not her fault that…"
5279,THe accommodation was excellent. Location was good and the breakfast selection was great. Easy access to tapas bar and the ramblas promenade. The amenities are adequate and the staff was very helpful too
5280,"I would definitely say that this hotel is not worthy of 4 stars, although there are some good points there are also many things that need to be improved.  Firstly I found the food to be extremely repetitive  with not much variety, usually only 1 or 2 meat dishes, lunches were also very similar to dinners. The all inclusive drinks were okay, however were all pre mixed with not much alcohol in. The worst part was probably the entertainment, with the live music being very dull. If you have children I would definitely not recommend this hotel as the food is not very child friendly and neither is the entertainment. The entertainment also finished very early, meaning that there was nothing to do for the rest of the night.   However, good points were that the staff were all lovely and…"
5281,"The hotel is disgusting. Yes, it has a good location, but if your looking for cleanness and good customer service, dont let the front lobby fool you, the rooms are tiny but they will give you a bigger room if you pay more of course! the smell in the room is disgusting not to mention the pillows smelling like sweat, you hear absolutely EVERYTHING; construction, cars honking, people from the room next door talking and lastly, the advertise having a fitness facility but its not even in the hotel, its 3 blocks away.   Since we booked the hotel for 3 nights, we did stay one night but tried changing hotel for our other 2 nights for better rest, well with their TERRIBLE customer service they charged us the 3 nights and even gave us an attitude!! This ruined our stay in San Francisco…"
5283,"not much to say about this place.  It's got a decent bus shuttle service, rooms are simple and clean but there is little in terms of pampering e.g. the complimentary bathroom supplies are so small they may as well be none existent.  Internet is acceptable and there is a good range of TV channels available for free.  I got a very good rate and would say I got value for money.  Although when I inquired about late checkout I was quoted 30 euros for 4 hours!! I only paid 44 for the night!  If you want to spend time around the main areas of Amsterdam choose something central, if you need somewhere for a night before/between flights then this is a good low cost option."
5284,"If you like reliving your college dorm days, then this place is for you! The rooms are small and the furniture is straight out of a college dorm. The breakfast buffet is $30!! The quality of the food is crap. If you want to walk anywhere, forget it. This place sits on the top of Nob Hill, not suitable for people who aren't in shape. "
5285,"Stayed here overnight when travelling between San Francisco and Las Vegas.  There was lots of parking and the town itself was nice.  The room was big, clean and comfortable but it was VERY dark.... everything was brown.... dark dark brown.   Breakfast options weren’t great so just had toast and orange juice.   It was fine but thought it would have been better for the price. I’d stay somewhere else if I was back again. "
5286,"Amazing location, close to Notre-Dame and Pantheon, with a lot of great restaurants and bar in walking distance. Great room (superior double), roomier than most Paris hotel. Very clean and great service. Will be back. "
5287,"Rooms were very dated, aircon didn't work properly and fan screached.  They were very clean though! Made a complaint as we were all-inclusive and managed to get downgraded to B&B with a refund. I would not recommend this hotel as a 4 star property - closer to a 2 star! Location was fine but a lot of the rooms have no view whatsoever!"
5288,Stayed at this hotel for 3 days in October 2019. The staff is friendly and the rooms are nicely decorated. Only negative is the very smelly hallway on floor 3 (smell extended into our room). We checked other floors in the hotel and some of them also smelled. The staff mentioned that this was due to the low river levels (?) and that it would go away. Unfortunately the smell did not go away and it was a big damper on the otherwise nice experience at this hotel.
5289,"It's a great hotel, very modern, very clean, comfy beds, very quiet, great buffet breakfast, but...**the pool is only open from 9-5pm**!!! This is why I took one star off.  This hotel is in a new business district, so I imagine many people using the hotel on will be on business trips and they'll be working between 9 & 5pm (like I was).  I wanted to either go swimming before work or to relax after, but it would be the same if I was there on leisure: I might be out visiting during the day, but I would want to chill in the pool in the evening or early morning.  I've complained to the front desk staff about this, but they could not do anything (understable).  I would still recommend this hotel, but just beware of these pool opening hours. I had picked this hotel because of the…"
5290,"I never saw an hotel showing such a gap between its category and the professionalism of its staff. My friend and I arrived early in the morning. No room was already available, which can be naturally understood given the early hour. The staff politely invented us to take a seat in the lobby. As no information was given to us concerning the availability of the room, we though it could be soon. One hour after, nobody had come to give us further details. Coffees and croissants were offered to us. More than two hours after, we still have no information. The night reception team was replaced by a new one, made of younger employees. They passed a lot of time to talk to each other, to laugh and even to hug each other. Seeing them was a kind of surrealistic show. Taking care of clients…"
5291,"Well the title of my review says it alll...but I'll expound.  First of all, I consider myself a pretty level headed person but when I feel I've been cheated or my wife has been mistreated...I have no tolerance for that....thus why I'm posting this review.  Below is a response that I sent to the 4S Hotel Manager.  His initial email seemed like a boiler plate, ""we're sorry you had an unfortunate experience, but if you want to drop another couple grand at our hotel we'll upgrade you next time.""   It unnerved me and also, I haven't received a response to my reply.  Here's my email and review that pretty well sums up our experience:  My wife and I love the 4S Resorts & Hotels.  We had a wonderful stay 2 of the 3 nights at your hotel.    However, our final night was a literal…"
5292,terrible.  do not stay here.  it is under construction and no one warned us of this ahead of time.  the place is an absolute disaster.  its dirty.  they made no amends for us to put up with this.  I wouldn't stay here if you paid me
5293,"Just back from a long weekend stay at Hotel Max which was the perfect anitidote to post Brexit stress. The hotel is clean, modern and welcoming. The staff are friendly and efficient. Hotel Max is situated in a very nice area - connections to the sites are made easy by the proximity to the Line 4 Metro (no changes needed from Gare du Nord) and the 38 bus. We hopped on and off the later and discovered some very nice places. There are some lovely bakeries and bistros within a few moments of the hotel. Very highly recommended - we hope to return soon."
5295,"This hotel is located in Greektown. It is a multistory slab, The rooms are small. The entire hotel is tired and desperately needs an update. Everything about this place needs updating; the carpets, the technology in the rooms, the staff training, the appointments in the rooms. I get the sense that whoever owns this place is cheap and would rather deal with periodic complaints than make the obvious improvements.   The location is great. The hotel is not."
5296,"You waste your time advertising the rooftop bar but me and my companion arrived at 9:30 p.m. and weren't allow upstairs.  We were told only the hotel guest need to be accommodated first and just maybe by 11:30 p.m. we would get in.  Before all of that we needed to check if 11:30 p.m. was still OK  to line up next to the hotel, then pay a cover fee.  We drove from Elgin and just were so bummed out to get rejected or get a maybe? So, don't come to the WIT expecting to get in cause it's just a maybe.  I would look elsewhere.  Wouldn't even want to know what the service would be inside.  UGH!! annoyed!"
5298,"Don’t book a room here and expect that room to actually be reserved for you. Seriously, avoid this place. We booked well in advance, and when we arrived (before check-in time), we were told that the room wasn’t ready and to come back at noon. Not a problem; we expected that. When we returned again, they said the room should be ready by 3. We said we had plans and couldn’t return until that night, but we left our bags and they knew we were returning (and we had a reservation). We got back to the hotel close to 10pm, and there was no room available for us. They sent us to a hotel in the middle of nowhere instead. We had planned on having a late dinner at a restaurant close to the Crowne Plaza after checking in, which we couldn’t do because the hotel they sent us to wasn’t anywhere…"
5300,"I stayed for 1 night in December, and  to start with a positive, the hotel is in a great location, located only a 2 minute walk from the free passenger ferry terminal, which goes into the centre of Amsterdam.  First impressions were good, although the hotel is small, it offers everything you need for a short stay.  Check in was a slow and painful process. With only one person at reception, it was a long wait in the queue, not what I wanted after a long day.  I had already waited 10 minutes for someone to raise the car park barrier, so I was frustrated at this point.  My room was on the 5th floor, and had a view across the river. The rooms are very small, but adequate.  However, the lighting in the room is poor, even with all lights on it was a strain on my eyes to see my laptop…"
5301,"Reception staff good, caring and welcoming. Room without charm, but big and comfortable with quite a nice view. Hotel itself is charmless and if you come for business it will suit you, but for leisure there are way better options. Swimming pool is quite depressing, nobody there. Staff let us set up our stuff without reacting, I had to go and ask for towels. and for a drink. Food is OK but not outstanding. Buffet breakfast has a lot of variety, but dishes are quite tasteless."
5302,We went to Roc fleuri for 3 nights and stayed in their seperate room adjacent to the main building . Our lady host and her husband Max were very friendly .  The room was very quiet and spacious and the breakfast excellent / fresh ! Highly recommended ! 
5303,"Horrible Experience.  The rooms were very cold. Bathroom was tiny. In addition, the front desk seemed like it was a chore when I asked them where certain places were and overall I felt miserable. I will never go there again."
5304,"This hotel is a nice medium sized hotel.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.  Most of the rooms overlook the wharf which is great.  Rooms are small but standard for European sizes.  I did not eat at the restaurant so can't comment on the food.  My biggest complaint with this hotel is the location and difficulty getting to it.  When you get Amsterdam Central Station you have to take a ferry across the harbour to get to the hotel.  Ferries generally run every 30 mins and it's free.  The ferry terminal is just outside of Amsterdam Central which is easy to get to.  The hotel is right next to the ferry drop off. The problem is if you want to just go for a walk in Amsterdam Central you need to wait for a ferry, take a 10 min ride and to the same to get back to the hotel.  I like…"
5305,"Great staff, very nice room, we got upgrade because the kitchen didnt work. Unfortunately no vegan hot food x breakfast - and a wide range of nonvegan food for others guests anyway teh second day we got tofu and vegan cheese. We could not try restaurant - no vegan options."
5306,"I have started going on trips in Europe since 2008.Cosmo hotel ,and I say it with certainty was the best hotel in all aspects that I have ever been. The rooms are not only very modern and elegant decorated but also they are very functional in all aspects. Also the hotel is very clean. Its stuff was very helpful and kind and they all had a very good mood . Its very importand to talk to people with good energy ! Also I was very happy that our rooms were ready for an early check-in because we arrived in the morning with the aeroplane and we had the chance to settle up and start our tour in the city more organized . The hotels place is also very very good. Its next to the metro-station and also very central and near to many of the city sightseens and restaurants."
5307,We stayed in one of the rooms that had amazing views of Eiffel Tower. The room was clean and as it was advertised online. The view is amazing especially in the evening where you can see the Eiffel Tower illuminated right from your bed. Will stay here again! 
5308,"This hotel was quietly tucked away, five minutes from the metro and just three stops from the Gare du Nord.  Bedrooms were well appointed and made good use of the space available.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  No reason not to return."
5309,"Having recently stayed at this 4 star hotel I found the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and tidy although a bit on the gloomy side as the windows did not permit much light in and the room lighting was - shall we say - subdued. The bar and reception areas were nice too although much of it was geared to football fans; 3 televisions apparently permanently set to sports channels. If you don' t like football, you're stuck with it.  So far, so good. That is until you get into the breakfast room. Well actually there are two but they don't like you to use the nicer one so you are then ushered into the crowded scruffy one. Most of the chairs are well past their best and several have disgusting, suspicious stains on the seats. Other chairs have padded arms…"
5310,"Brilliant suites perfect location well appointed and helpful staff. Would recommend for long weekends, couples or families, and ideal if on business. Clean, bright, quiet and comfortable. Staff attentive and polite."
5311,Hotel clean room spacious. Bathrooms need upgraded. Staff friendly and breakfast adequate. Bar closes to early. Short staffed. Jacuzzi pool good pool good more sunbeds required. Air con in room excellent. Central location to access bars and restaurants.
5312,The loocation was great - walking distance to Zoo station with several U and S bahn trains. Bus stops also right out front. Good shopping along the main street also. There is also a great salad/sandwich place directly opposite called Dean & David. Otherwise at night it's very quiet.
5313,Loved the location! Staff were friendly but the rooms are awfully small. I understand that most hotel rooms in Europe are small compared to the USA but this was beyond ridiculous! Hubby and I could barely move in there once we added our luggage! Glad we only stayed for 1 night! My brother and his wife opted for a bigger room and theirs was no better! Rooms are good for solo travelers!
5314,Only 5 minutes walking from the station. Supermarket is just around the corner. You can walk to Checkpoint Charlie and other major tourist destinations. Room is squeaky clean! Ms. Cortese who helped us with the check-in gave us the room with the best city view! She is also very courteous and smiling all the time. Thank you very much for the lovely stay :-)
5316,"We were dealt with at the front desk by friendly and helpful staff. Rooms were spotless, we had 1 issue with a room and it was sorted instantly. Bar and coffee shop downstairs were great too. Well worth the visit"
5317,This hotel was located in the middle of where everything happened. It was close to some lovely restaurants and you never had to walk far to feel part of the city vibe. The staff at this hotel were friendly and always willing to assist. The breakfast in the morning is on the 7th floor with a beautiful view but breakfast it self was nothing special. The room was an average size and clean. We booked a taxi to the airport and the hotel told us it will be 15 euro well it ended up being 30 euro because it was early in the morning. So make sure you get to confirm the price before taking the taxi as the hotel doesn't have their own shuttle service.
5318,This hotel his ideally located for business trips and vacation too. Close to the metro and easy to get taxi service. It is very quiet for such a central location too. The rooms are excellent and the Mathurin Suite has an pleasant large terrace and is fairly priced. Highly recommended for business is or pleasure 
5319,"This is a great location for sight seeing. The majority of sights are within easy walking distance such as Reichstag, Brandenburg gate, check point charlie and the Holocaust memorial. Being on Friedrichstrasse also made it close to the train station, bars, cafes and restaurants. The hotel room was clean and well laid out. The beds were very comfortable and the pillows were of a high quality. The shower was also very good, with great water pressure. room was cleaned and beds were made daily. My only gripe was that there was no coffee or tea making facilities, I really like a cup of coffee when I wake up and although this forced me out of the room I would have happily had a coffee whilst getting ready. Overall a very nice, welcoming hotel."
5321,"This hotel is in an excellent location, and is clean and well maintained with helpful, friendly staff. There are some interesting 70s throwbacks - for example being given a dressing down for forgetting to leave the key at reception when popping out for a cigarette was, erm, interesting."
5322,"Very nice hotel, good breakfast, you should also try the restaurant Quadriga, centrallay located - beautiful lights in the evening, romantic, good rooms & very good service - a number one hotel in Berlin!"
5324,"Liar, liar - right from the start.  My husband & I were attending a family reunion in Berkeley & decided we'd like to stay over at an affordable victorian in the City rather than drive the 90 minutes back to our home in Santa Rosa.  We booked three weeks in advance through a reputable online service, & received reservation confirmation via email from the booking service AND from the hotel directly.  When we got to the hotel to check in, Raj told us that he didn't seem to have our reservation.  We told him that actually, just that morning before we left home, we received an email from the hotel confirming our reservation.  He scrolled through a few more screens & asked us to step aside wait while he ""looked into it.""  He came back & told us quite apologetically that, ""The online…"
5325,"Check in was easy and the staff is friendly. Room size is ok, though ambient is on the darker side. It's strange to see hand wash basin in the same room as the beds. Room is clean and well keep. Good breakfast choices. Hotel is just right at the corner of Casa Battlo, and very near to metro station. Abundant of shops nearby for shopping."
5326,"For the same price, you can get better offers. The room was pretty noisy due to ""the loop"" being very close and windows giving no isolation. We did not have one towel per person in the room when we arrived, and after our first night, the used towels were removed, but not replaced by new ones... Great surprise when you go out from the shower the following day! Breakfast is better than what I have seen in some hotels, but is only acceptable, not great. Last but not least, there a kitchen in the room... but you can't use it because the ""burners"" from the stove have been removed, and the dishwasher is out of order!!! This stay was clearly not worth the price we paid for it!"
5327,We weren’t guests of the Zoo hotel but we stopped for a drink. Very nice lobby and bar . The huge fire place and the huge door compose  an avant-garde decoration.Relaxing music. Service was ok. Drinks and atmosphere very good. Check: 6 vodka and 1 glass of wine 90€.
5328,"Perhaps the use of the word ""suites"" in the hotel name gives an false expectation of luxury, which this hotel did not really meet.  The room was large and the bed / bathroom could be closed off using movable room dividers but apart from that it was nothing really special.  The staff were a positive - being friendly and helpful and the location is conveniently close to an S Bahn station and it is in walking distance of Checkpoint Charlie and Potsdamm.  My stay was probably ruined by the large school groups who were also staying there - they were noisy, badly behaved and tied up the lifts most of the time.   The WiFi service in the room was patchy at best but worked well in the bar.  Didn't help that my phone kept jumping to global data roaming.   While the room was large the…"
5329,"For me the two outstanding things about this hotel are the excellent staff for whom nothing was too much trouble and the perfect central location. I very much like contemporary design and boutique style hotels (thus my booking) however this hotel has some flaws.  Our first floor room had blackout curtains but no net curtain or blind and for any privacy from the street we had to close the curtains and use artificial light. This is very annoying during daylight hours. The contemporary bathroom was very good and interesting but the useless dim lighting was quite hopeless for putting contacts in or cosmetics on etc. The very sparse furnishing, poor lighting and grey walls made our room feel more cave like than chic. Our room was really more “design statement” than a pleasure to stay…"
5330,"We stayed at this hotel for two nights, and our stay was fine. Rooms are clean (very tight, though), and the hotel is located close to the center, 300m from subway station and KaDeWe shopping mall. Staff was nice and helpful. One minus - we have ordered room with single bed, but received 2 single beds in our room. Breakfest is pretty expensive - 20EUR per person. The have parking lot for hotel guests, also for 20EUR per night.   In summary - hotel is fine, I can reccomend to stay there."
5331,"It's clean, the room at rooftop is very nice, and the cost is a plus. You can go everywhere without trouble, as the hostel is close to the metro stations of Belleville and Couronnes. There's plenty of places to eat nearby, from tunisian to chinese restaurants, and every tuesday there's a open market at Bellevile boulevard. I'll be looking for this place whenever i'm back to Paris. And the view from the rooftop is amazing, you can see almost everything in Paris."
5332,"This was my first trip abroad with my boyfriend and one we will never forget. We are both 23 and were looking for somewhere clean, friendly and good value to stay and that is exactly what we got.  The reception staff were extremely welcoming and helpful, showing us how to get to places on the metro, where to eat and drink and kindly holding our bags on our last day as we had a later flight. The rooms were so clean, the bathroom new and the room air conditioned, which were all great to come back to after busy days of adventuring around Paris. The bedrooms are quite small, but enough room for the two of us to put our luggage out and get ready every morning and evening without getting in each others way. I did not find this a problem at all. We got very good sleep, only slight…"
5333,"Just back from a week at this hotel and we were very impressed.  The hotel is very close the Metro and we liked the area. There are several places to eat, pharmacy and shops nearby as well as a market round the corner. The room is small but very clean and nicely decorated, we had a triple room as my husband and I were travelling with our 3 year old daughter. The room was cleaned daily.  We were on the 5th floor and had a small balcony which my daughter loved although the weather was not great. We found the beds comfortable, room had a safe, TV , small fridge and hairdryer. We didn't try the breakfast as we were up and out early visiting Disneyland etc.  Unfortunately due to bad weather in the UK our flight was cancelled, the staff were lovely and tried to help us out as much as…"
5334,"Was a good location as there is a nearby Metro Stop or you could easily walk to the city center.  Breakfast was great ! Nice selection of breads, cold cuts, cheeses and scrambled eggs.  Thermostat was hard to figure out - several days it got pretty warm and I couldn’t seem to switch the a/c on - seemed like heat was the only option.  Windows opened which was fine.  If I had one wish for this hotel it’s that they had a mini-fridge in the room! ! There is a nice little market up the road and it would have been great to stock a fridge up with drinks to keep cold. They do have an ice machine in the lobby - I couldn’t find any ice buckets though (I probably should have asked).  I was able to redeem IHG points at this location "
5336,"Great location, 5 min walk from the Bund, newly renovated. Sounds great, but there is a lot to improve! Rooms are spacious enough, comfortable beds.  Breakfast OK. Chinese staff is friendly BUT their English is very poor, and they are not trained in HORECA at all. Some speak no English and do not understand what to do. The rooms are clean, but nobody ever cleaned the windows. Wat a dirty view! As for facilities - the A/C was not working, it was very hot at night. I needed to open the windows with polluted air and noise coming into the room. The manager said that it was due to the season and that they will switch on A/C when the summer season starts. This is not really true, in other better hotels in Shanghai the A/C is working all year round with both cooling or warming…"
5337,"The main issue was that promised facilities were not available and this had knock-ons to the rest of our requirements. This was very disappointing. The rest was your typical 'business' hotel.  Rooms were clean, and on the small end of average size. Bar area was way too small for hotel of it's (due to lack of availability of other areas - but clearly this is bad management to close down to similar function areas at the same time)"
5338,"Ideal for what we were after, fairly central and 10/15 minutes walk to a big square with lots of places to eat etc. 10 minutes taxi to the Brandenburg Gate.   24 hour bar and friendly staff on bar and reception always happy to help and enjoying our attempts at German.   The room itself was functional, great shower, basically what you needed to rest your head and recover from a hangover. Really good value for money compared to what you'd get for the same money at home. "
5339,"I go to south beach every year and this hotel by far is THE WORST. All the hassles I went through just for one night -  - They forget to put toiletries in the room, found out right after I checked in and took them over an hour to provide it. -Toilet paper holder is broken and nobody came to fix after multiple calls. -The shower is slippery and I fell and hurt my back. Nobody came to clean it up or fix it. Spoke to the manager and he said they are aware of it. Then why are you not fixing it and renting those rooms out whereas you know it’s hazardous. -Everytime we went down, there’s nobody at the front desk or concierge after 7/8 pm and NO SECURITY!   NEVER going back!"
5340,"It’s our first time on Kauai and the location is great. The hotel is nice, but customer service is not up to Marriott standards. We are here to celebrate my birthday and when we were checking in, the receptionist kindly offered to send us a bottle of champagne on this occasion. Well, my birthday has passed and champagne still hasn’t arrived. Quite disappointed by this level of attention. Also my husband ordered flowers to be delivered on my birthday 3 days in advance. They called him on the day and said that they don’t have the flowers he requested and they can deliver tomorrow which is the day after my birthday. Also extremely disappointing. The next thing, we called reception to help us book tickets to see the luau show that day because online reservations were unavailable. It…"
5341,The hotel is ok but it's so dismal.  Everywhere is black  The public areas the conference rooms are bedrooms. The breakfast room thankfully is not.  Rooms a decent size.  Lack of power outlets  Breakfast adequate. Staff pleasant. Reasonable place 
5342,"I had stayed around the corner in Copacabana for a few nights at the Rio Copacabana hotel, then booked to stay in Ipanema. I wish I had of stayed in the first hotel as they were the same price yet the first was a lot nicer...   Ipanema Inn is very basic, similar to Travelodge but more worn down. The rooms and bathroom are smaller - it's the location which you pay for. The breakfast was quite nice, however the hotel doesn't offer any additional facilities.  The staff insisted I pay a cash staff tip of 10% as I was checking out, I had already been tipping the staff for good service, as I wasn't aware of this charge as its not advertised anywhere. The man on reception said its optional but insisted I should pay it and seemed demanding, I refused as I'd only been there for one night…"
5343,"This hotel was fine for a short break, but lacked any extra facilities.  We did not receive the twin room we booked, so a little bit inconvenient, but not too much as it was a short stay so didn't spend too much time in the hotel.  The rooms were comfortable, slept quite well.  Would recommend for a short stay, not enough facilities for longer stay."
5344,Booked this hotel after reading some of the positive reviews here on Trip advisor. Checked in for a 6 night stay and was dissatisfied with our room from the moment we checked in. It was small and dark with stains on the light colored carpeting. the view was of a train depot . Our booking stated we would have city views. Not the case. We tried to speak with the front desk but they wanted to charge us a large fee to change rooms. So we had to deal with the room we were given. Our booking included breakfast and it was certainly not up to standards with breakfast being served at room temperatures with a minimal variety. Omelet station was slow and undercooked. We ate there only twice. The front doors of the hotel were used as a smoking area and was constantly impeded by smoking…
5345,"This is a beautiful hotel.  Beautiful rooms.  Wonderful staff. The elevators are a disaster which cause you a 15-30 min delay each time you come or go.  Paying 500 plus for a room and incurring a delay of 25 mins to get down to the lobby makes this place one you can't stay at.  The staff could not have been nicer, almost trained on the elevator issue.  But as a person on the move, nothing is more frustrating that waiting for an elevator for it to be full, or not arriving for 25 mins.  Total insanity you might be ok on the weekdays but weekend traffic was terrible.  Do not stay. So many good options in Chicago without this extremely frustrating attribute.  "
5346,"The hotel is good but the facilities are a bit old fashioned, a renovation is necessary in my point of view. The room was clean, there is a mini fridge with beverages and a coffee maker in the room. The breakfast was ok, many choices. They charged me for an extra breakfast which was included in my rate but I got in contact after and they did the reimbursement.  The location is good, it is in the middle of the way between the airport and downtown. To downtown it is about 45 minutes walking just to have an idea. There is a metro station very close (campo pequeno). Also, a supermarket about three block away (pingo doce). I just stayed two nights but everything was ok."
5347,"If you do not want to stay in the middle of the city, this place is perfect for you. Its a bit in a quite neighborhood, far from the usual sense of city's crowd. The hotel is OK for one day and if you want to stay close to the airport. However, I was expecting more cleanliness and better services related to its' price. I stayed here for 2 nights, my room was not cleaned, there was no shower gel/shampoo in the toilet and I had to call their services to get some of those. the same thing happened in the following day too - I had to call the room services to get shampoo and shower gel. I also noticed the similar lack of cleanliness in the restaurant, tables were not cleaned, used dishes were not removed and people were waiting to get the tables to be cleaned, as it happened to me…"
5348,"This hotel whilst looking good from the outside needs to seriously consider what it is offering the guests. Whilst being not far from Shanghai it is far from international in its outlook.  The rooms ( I changed once) smelled somewhat damp. The selection of English cable channels is extremely limited. Beds firm. Strange round table and not a desk in the room.  Apart from reception staff English is extremely limited to the point of being non existent.  Breakfast selection was once again limited and is obviously catering to Chinese guests.  This hotel feels like it is in the middle of nowhere, so you are limited to what is on offer at the hotel.  I wouldn't recommend this hotel for international guests. It doesn't cater for them and as such is way over priced for what you receive."
5351,My admin booked the room based on pictures on the hotel website.  The room I stayed in was stuck in 1970s and the carpet stains definitely only added to the outdated ambiance.  The hotel has seen better days.
5352,Great stay - very comfortable and very quiet despite being on a lively street. Metro close by and plenty of good places to go out. Breakfast was really good too - less industrial than in most hotels in this price range. Staff were very friendly too.
5353,"If you don't drink coffee in the mornings (or any other time), you may be perfectly happy at this hotel.  The rooms are a good size, there's good work space, mattresses are ok, etc. BUT...  This is the only hotel I can remember staying in recently (including other Joie de Vivre hotels) that doesn't have coffee or tea making facilities in the room.  When I checked in, I was told that complimentary coffee was available in the lobby from (if I remember correctly) 4 am until 11.  That means that if you want coffee in the morning, you need to get up, get dressed and go to the lobby to get it.  If you don't want to do that (or want coffee at any other time) your only option appears to be to pay them $28 (before tax) for a 20 oz. coffee from room service.  Let me say that one more time…"
5354,"Staff were fantastic, everything else was poor. Room was poorly serviced with the bed made by someone who is unfamiliar with how a bed looks. Used plates and cups only washed if left in sink but this was not requested i don't think. Bath had mould on the grout, a dirty disgusting vent above it and a shower that was unreliable. My husband burned his hand whilst showering. There was a light hanging out of the socket in the bathroom too. Carpet in hallways were ripped and worn. We stayed on level 7 which felt like it was the cleaners level. Attached café was substandard. Had pancakes which cost say $13 but there was nothing with them but some questionably fresh strawberries. Would not stay here again and think it poor quality for a 4 star hotel."
5355,"My last time here was Feb 2009 and it was such a good experience and that's why I chose this hotel again this time. Everything has changed. Rooms r so old and outdated. Nothing works starting from TV in the room to the desktop PC's and printers in the business centre. I tried to use the business centre last night to print few papers and after wasting 20 minutes and $20 i wasn't able to print any paper and again I have to speak the the concierge to refund my $20, I was like ""what about my 20 minutes??!!"". Nobu restaurant which used to be a hot spot also moved out. The minute you walk in here you feel that this hotel has no management and is totally controlled by the low position workers. I didnt feel welcomed at all. And the funny thing is that i just asked room service to bring…"
5357,"Lovely room, although not as clean as expected cooker /dishes needed a proper clean.. Bedding and toilet area very clean. T. V a bit poor not many  channels in English n no netflix.not soundproof could hear next door. Overall yeah it was nice but not worth the price still a 20min walk into town and nothing exceptional. "
5358,"Clean and tidy rooms, quiet surroundings and peaceful hotel. Tasty brekfast and good coffee. You can find restaurants nerby, pubs and tube to get to city centre, very convenient! I would recommend it to everyone for a business stays"
5359,"Great fun, actively encourage you to enjoy the bar and go on organized trips with the other residents.  Beyond helpful staff.   Highly recommended.    Very near to the subway and easy access to the city center.   "
5360,"This apartment is suitable for small family or group of friends. location is just 5 mins to Barcelona Sants train station and Metro. Thanks to Laura, the friendly apartment staff who waited for us  and explained the detail during check-in and out. She also patiently answer to our question. Advise for those who wants to catch the early train to airport. please check the timing 1 day before to avoid waiting 1 hr for the next train."
5361,"These apartments are located in a beautiful building and the apartments themselves were very lovely.  The apartment that we stayed in (""Mon plaisir""/ Luxury duplex apartment) was very spacious, nicely decorated and clean. Everything was very convenient inside the apartment.  The location is very nice as well- it was on a nice street with beautiful churches and it was very quiet and safe at night. It's a very short stroll to 'La Croisette' and not too far away from the other attractions.  We would definitely recommend this accommodation and will definitely come back!  Thank you!! "
5362,"Stayed in the room on the 6th floor overlooking Grolmanstrasse. Temperature inside a bit too high, AC adjustment didn't help. Not an issue though, as it is fairly quiet even with windows open. Bathroom could have been bigger, but still not a major downside. WiFi signal a bit too weak in the room, much better in the lobby and sitting area downstairs.  Unbeatable location within short walk to Savignyplatz full of places to dine in or for a drink. Conveniently located in terms of public transport, as tram and metro stations are really close. Plenty of shopping opportunities nearby, including big organic grocery and fashion stores on Kudamm.  Nice comfortable lobby. Lively Van Gogh bar next door. Indoor car parking right at the hotel, reasonably priced. Overall very nice NH chain…"
5363,"Firstly this hotel goes by various names (why? Who knows): Hotel Max, Hotel Floris (not the same as the one that is centrally located) and Hotel Iris. You have to check in at a separate building to the one you actually stay at, it's nearby (they send you instructions closer to the date of your booking) We were very lucky bc we got a ground floor room, so no luggage lugging up or down the stairs (other than the few steps up into the building itself) The room was better than I expected for this budget price. It was VERY small though - lots of bumping into things while we sorted our luggage - we took out the essential we needed, re-packed and closed the luggage and stored them in the cupboard so we could navigate around the room.  Interesting bathroom - it was one single room,…"
5366,"- stayed as a tourist for 4 nights. - selected the hotel based on reviews and a good deal with accor. - found it to be good value for money and met our needs.  Room: clean, small but well appointed and very comfortable. Minimal road noise and Some noise from other guests and mainly cleaner. You get the one soap suits all needs from a communal dispenser and a bath mat but no hand towel.    Staff: most of the staff were very friendly and welcoming. One was a bit surly.  All spoke good English. They stored our luggage for us after check out.   Rest of hotel: has a bar area, a breakfast area and a car park. We didn't use the later two.  It is clean and well presented and a pleasant space to be in. Appears to have access for disabled /wheelchairs.   Location: this was the major perk…"
5367,"Just back from 3 nights at the Meininger West. It is a cross between a low cost hotel and a hostel. Pleasant, helpful staff. 2 lifts for the hotel. Breakfast is continental, no cooked food except hard boiled eggs. You clear your plates etc to a kitchen area. Plenty of seating but it gets busy after 9am. Can get toasties throughout the day and a selection of sandwiches at the bar. Also a couple of vending machines. There’s a kitchen area with hobs and microwave if you want to cook your own food. Saucepans etc too. Lots of what seemed to be school trips and stag and hen parties, can be a bit noisy late at night but not for long. Need your swipe room card to get into the hotel after 11pm. Rooms basic with small beds, 3 in a twin room and double room. Always hot water in very good…"
5368,"Very inflexible hotel- would not adjust our reservation at all once it was booked. Because of that, I would recommend a recognizable hotel chain instead. We never were able to have our room cleaned during the stay which was another let down. They did have 24 hour coffee and tea which was nice but that was sadly the best part of the hotel. "
5369,"the hotel is nice and very , good space the restaurent is good and the staff very friendly , pleasant spaces to spend time with amusements with games and music , outdoor space with terrace , all very nice "
5370,"Location is very good and everywhere is reachable from a walkable distance metro station 'Place d'italie'  Staff is very kind and helpful  Rooms are small but that's Paris standard, apart from that they are modern and well kept.  Cleanliness: rooms and the overall hotel are always kept very clean.  Breakfast: had a wide variety of pastries, boiled eggs, fresh baguettes, slice toast bread, juice, hot beverages machine, juice and water, milk, cereals, yoghurts.... overall it was very good.  Overall the hotel is very good value for money!  Also, I would like to thank Valeska the receptionist for her kind and helpful approach especially on the last day!"
5371,"We arrived at the hotel in our car and were told that overnight parking was $17. Twice. Very clearly. $17. The amount was not posted anywhere at the valet station. The stay at the hotel was pretty average. Then we receive an email with our final bill. The parking charge was $72. The hotel refused to honor the $17 quote, or even make any attempt to resolve the issue. Will not stay again."
5372,"I booked executive room in the new Shangri-La building next to the old one, but the decor in the room looked very very old. They’ve used some cheap wood materials and it looked so bad( see picture).   City views was good but go for Ritz if you can spend £50 more.   At £200 per night it’s natural to think you would get a great shower( most hotels anywhere in the world would offer rain shower for this price). But the shower at Shangri-La, 33rd floor was so disappointing it barely wet you. We thought the shower is broken so we called an engineer. The engineer confirmed this is normal water pressure that we would get and we were surprised.   Seriously you will get a better shower from a bed and and breakfast.   Next time in Shanghai we will never stay here. "
5374,"not scenic man-made beach in bay with no waves, shared with busy anti-relaxing Disney hotel.  Four Seasons took over this Marriott property and you can tell.  Fitness Center and spa are plopped in not ideal places rather than thoughtfully and scenically designed.  Rooms are ok.  Disney Aulani resort towers are way too close and kill vibe.  Ocean view rooms look out onto ocean and some sort of industrial (sewage?) plant.  There’s no evening Hawaiian entertainment, like a Hawaiian dancer or Hawaiian band, and resort feels characterless.  There’s a huge canoe plopped in the entrance that blocks passage through the rotunda and is bad fung schwei.  3 on site restaurants are pretty good but not much else food wise off campus.  Four Seasons Hualalai especially and then Maui (if you…"
5375,"Probably one of the nicest lobbies in San Francisco, the let down is the actual rooms and the hallways which have a ""best western"" feel to it. I was actually disappointed by this and the fact that they had a facility fee which was a charge for random items that I would consider included in the price to begin with, such as ""coffee in the lobby if you so choose to have some""  "
5376,"I stayed here for (4) nights over the July 4th holiday, it is a very nice hotel in a great location.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Great views from the rooftop terrace.  The room was clean, cozy and comfortable.  The bathroom vanity might be considered a bit small for some people but I managed.  I walked to all the major tourist sites from here (the furthest was probably Park Guell which was about an hour walk, 40 minute to Sagrada Familia, 30 minutes to Casa Mila and Casa Batllo)."
5377,"Charming hotel, with all the necessities. Relaxed environment with very helpful and friendly staff. Close to the heart of Cannes and an array of restaurants.  Clean, tidy rooms and wonderful pool. Loved it. "
5378,I love this hotel location. It is stone throw away from the subway. The free flow coffee and tea is what i really appreciate during my stay. Room is well maintained. Bed are comfortable and clean. There are many stores around the hotel.
5379,"My mom and I went to Chicago this past weekend to celebrate her 70th birthday. I picked this hotel mainly based on the Hilton reputation and the fact that this location was very central to everything we’d want to do while we were there. The stay was great until the last day when I woke up with bites on my arm. I had bed bugs when I lived in New York many years ago and so I was definitely worried about what they might be, but I decided not to think about it and go about our day. However, while lying in bed on the last evening, I FOUND A BED BUG IN MY BED. I repeat, I FOUND A BED BUG IN MY BED. My mom and I immediately trapped it in a glass and called the front desk. Stephanie came up with a maintenance man, who each took one look at the bug and Stephanie immediately said, “We are…"
5380,"This is surely not 5* it has most certainly seen better days. In need of some serious tender care, rooms are inconsistent in sizes. Breakfast is certainly nothing to shout about restaurant feels like a cafeteria and staff sometimes a little grumpy. Reception staff are polite and friendly which is one saving grace...."
5381,"This is a very traditional old-style hotel with what appeared to be a high number of staff per guest. It’s located in the quiet, embassy district about a 25 minute walk into the centre of Lisbon. As I say, it’s quite old fashioned and my guess is that it appeals more to the older set, particularly Americans. It’s 5 star and, in my view, quite expensive for what is generally quite a cheap country. Personally, if I come back to Lisbon, I would be inclined to stay more centrally in a more modern, boutique-style hotel which would probably be cheaper."
5382,"We stayed here for two nights. The room and everything were very clean. But I felt like the hotel only cares about money. When we wanted to check in early the staff suggested to pay more to get a more expensive room. And yesterday they gave us the letter which says if we want the late check out we have to pay more. And before we come here I saw many people said their mini bar was free so I emailed if we also can get a free mini bar, they said no but instead they will give us a discount coupon for the massage. I said we don't need that because I am pregnant I would rather have the free mini bar. And they never answered and surely we didn't get free mini bar service. I travel a lot but have never seen a hotel cares about money this much. Even though they do they try not to show…"
5383,"The only criticism of the hotel  for a Thomson hotel was that it needed updating in the rooms, as it is stated as a 4star hotel in this day and age we were expecting tea and coffee facilities in the room or even on arrival, also expected water in the room for free. apart from the above the staff were very accomdating they couldn't do enough for you, and very friendly, and couldnt fault the food. nic and gary"
5384,"We stayed here for a weekend and it was really nice. Location of the hotel is great, not far from the center but in  a quiet neighbourhood with birds singing. Views from our room to the river were great. Room is quite big, with sofa and armchair. working desk. Breakfast is good, lots of things to eat - eggs, bacon, sasusages, sweets, dofferent sorts of cheese and ham, fruits, orange juice, etc. In the lobby there is also coffee machine, milk, home made lemonade which you can have anytime during the day. There is also a free map of Berlin. The hotel seems worn out - doors, shower, carpets.  The main thing I did not like is the lack of normal 4-star hotel shampoo, bath gel, etc. There is only all-in-one in the shower and near the sink (which was hard to squeeze), maybe it is ok…"
5385,When we got there our room wasn't ready had to wait 3 hours then please take note you can't do two weeks all inclusive here same food every night for 14 days isn't good and the restrant that u can go in once is the same has the food you get every day then we went to check out and they said we had to pay for the water we had they are always trying to make you pay for extras this is the worst all inclusive I have every been in and its not a four star I would say 2 star please don't waste your money try somewhere different the manageress is so rude if she smiled it would be to hard for her the only plus is that the manager he was lovely look some were else to spend your hard worked money else were !!
5386,Rooms tired. Long way out of centre. Poor concierge in general. Taxi tried ripping us off even after discussion with hotel staff. Bar attached to hotel wasn't open consistent times. Other staff were helpful and friendly
5387,"The room looked ok but the entire hotel reeked of mold and mildew. When asked about the smell workers pretended not to smell it but yet they came to the room with to deodorizer which only helped for 5 minutes. The hallway where the carpet is reeked the worse. Then they offer free drinks at happy hour which the choices are very limited and I don't mean the alcohol. I ordered vodka and orange juice,  simple right? Noooooooo was told that even though it advertised juice with drinks that don't serve juice. I'm over the experience of staying here and it has ruined my vacation. Has to violating some sort of health code with that strong moldy and mildew smell."
5388,Good bedroom - bathroom with heated floor and walk-in shower.  Attentive waiting staff in the restaurant. They actually smile. The breakfast bar is one of the best I know. Eggs cooked to order.  One hint: rent a bicycle to see Berlin. Faster and more pleasant than walking.
5389,"Common spaces are fantastic here.  However it is a party hostel, lots of young people going out.  So it is loud.  ThE beds are very uncomfortable and being on the upper bunk is like being in an earthquake whenever you roll over.  Great location, but wouldn't stay there again."
5390,"Hello,  I called to receive quotes and the agent was very rude.  Refused to answer my questions kept telling me to look online and i said i wanted him to help since online it advice to contact property.  Our family was going to book three rooms for new years.  Please advice the young man not to be disrespectful and rude to potential guest.  I will never stay at your hotel. Good luck with that agent named Wendell...    I will be writing additional comments online.  Have a wonderful evening."
5391,We booked a room here for a family wedding.  We were quoted a rate and overcharged. We tried to remedy the situation with Kim at front desk.   No help.  Pure rudeness. Than tried with Gladys Hernandez and her  customer service was equally as bad.  DO NOT STAY HERE!    Rooms are hideous.  We stayed on 23rd floor and couldn’t flush toilet and shower trickled.   The food is hideous.  Parking 50$ a day.  Way better Choices.    
5392,Excellent service without being 'too much'. Nice decor and facilities. Very relaxed in a luxury way. I can highly recommend this hotel - especially for a romantic get-away... Only minus is that as non-smoker I don't like being in a smokers bar.
5393,"Poor Housekeeping Practices. In spite of having Privacy Please card at the door, housekeeping entered the room. Felt invaded. Very disappointed as the hotel staff did not address my concerns.  Good location though."
5394,"On arrival there was no welcome and that little talk that makes a difference: was the trip good? Are you passing through or visiting Lisbon? Etc. I no longer speak of the failure to not be treated by my surname, as it is used in a 5 star Hotel. The young man who answered me asked me the reservation number and almost simultaneously the name. I gave my name. Concentrating on the computer, he did not even look at me. I told him the name again, but he did not answer, and he gave no sign of hearing me, I told him the name again. I asked him if I was wrong or he had asked me my name. He looked at me with a heavy look and told me that it was no longer necessary. Accustomed to traveling, I have found, with very few exceptions, a very similar pattern of behavior, which is to comply…"
5395,A beautiful hotel with wonderful gardens and pool. Accommodations are clean and comfortable. Unfortunately the service leaves much to be desired. The wait staff in the Garden area and the Bar/Dining area are some of the worse we have ever encountered. We were not alone with this feeling having been part of a large tour group. This was not due to lack of staff because there was adequate servers available. House keeping was great for the most part. Each day we received fewer replacement towels. Last night there had to call and request face towels and hand towels. Said no problem they would bring them up. Received the hand towels only. Not many good dining choices within walking distance. For a luxury hotel they should do better.
5396,"We booked this hotel after reading reviews online. Well, absolutely NOT as expected. 1. We received towels that were obviously dirty. No apology when we asked for fresh ones. 2. Hotel policy is to not change the sheets until you checkout. So if you stay for 10 days, same sheets. There is no discounted rates for clean sheets, it's the same. 3. At least one elevator was always down during our 5 day stay. So, if you up on the 25th floor, you either waited a 1/2 hr plus for the elevator and then crammed in like sardines, or did the stairs. We did have a good staff member allow us to use the staff service elevator, but again, had to wait. 4. Room was very dusty and certainly NOT clean. 5. The room air conditioner sounded like a big rig truck everything it came on. 6. Must say, the…"
5397,"Moved here from another Catalonia hotel, impressed with all the staff we came in contact with.  Room and roof top pool facilities fantastic.  Breakfast was expensive but plenty of options locally, try the Opera house across the road."
5398,"Visiting Chicago for a wedding,wanted a place convenient and stress free. It was close to the wedding, but not stress free. Website advertised VALET parking - no valet parking. Rooms were nice, but unable to regulate heat, staff unfriendly, not a hotel I would EVER visit again. When I talked to the manager her comments were..oh well we just changed a lot of items and unfortunately didn't update the website. sorry but thats life...how unfortunate..a good location, but lack of service, lack of caring, and lack of making things right...whatever happened to HOLIDAY INN..back to the MARRIOTT from now on"
5399,"I was here for a business trip. The location is perfect and the hotelstaff if very helpfull and friendly. I had problems sleeping due the softness fo the pillows. The staff brought me a other pillow so I would sleep perfect for my last night. The breakfats is extremly big, there is something for everyone. "
5400,"Summary:  I’ve been staying at Marriott properties and other hotels for over 30 years and I’ve seen some tasty things, but the lack of housekeeping standards at the W Hotel Chicago was the grossest experience I've had. On top of that, the lack luster management response was disappointing.   Detail: I’ll start off by taking some responsibility. I was in a hurry, traveling on business when I booked the hotel. I didn’t take the time I normally do to look at reviews. If I did, I would have discovered Marriott’s own website only gives it a 3.4 out 5. And only 57% people on say they recommend staying at the property. Trip Advisor has it rated as #140 out of 205 hotels. If I had done my homework, these would have been red flags to tell me to go elsewhere!  My arrival started on a…"
5401,"The hotel is in a great location near the shopping street and a major train station . Subway was right in front. Rooms are large and ultra modern. Bed was very comfortable and could lead you to oversleep. Didn’t have a chance to try their restaurants, but ordered several dishes from room service which surprisingly tasted good. On the other hand, service could improve a little bit. Having stayed at a few Waldorf Astoria properties, I felt that the level of service of professionalism from the staff here isn’t quite there yet. Overall, it was a great stay and I would return. "
5402,"My friend and I got a great deal for this hotel via secret escapes and I cannot fault any part of it. It’s a very small boutique hotel and every member of staff was friendly and helpful. It was stylish, very clean, and the breakfast was delicious. Honestly the best scrambled eggs I think I’ve ever had - I need to know the secret!!   Thank you for a wonderful stay and I’d definitely stay here again and recommend to others. "
5403,"The check in process was a joke.  I received an email that we could check in early at 9:00 am.  We arrived at 11:00 and our room wasn’t ready until after 4:00 pm.  Despite being asked for additional items when I made the reservation, I did not receive a room close to our friends, no mini fridge and no early check in.  "
5404,"No beddings after check in. Just bare mattress. Had an hour after check in before the next meeting. Hope to take a shower cause just got off from a long haul flight. Realized no amenities. Asked for it. Delivered after 45 min. Gave up the shower idea and headed to the meeting in a mess. Requested late check out till 2pm (as titanium member) when check in. Chatted via app later to request to extend to 4pm due to meeting schedule change. Was told even 2pm is not possible due to high demand. Need to get out by 12pm. Valid reason but why said nothing when check in? And then comes the amazing part: Back in the room late at night after meeting, realized there’s a loud noise that sounds like heavy machine running and lasts ~20 seconds every 15-20 minutes. Called service desk twice, was…"
5408,Very nice staff( shout out to Edris and Brighta).Quad room was nice( 4 sisters/first time in Paris)and clean. Location couldn’t be better.Walking distance to the Eiffel Tower and other tourist spots easily accessible by bus or metro(train).Highly recommenced as we will surely stay here again next time we visit Paris.
5410,"This hotel is in the Poblenou neighborhood of Barcelona.  I chose this location for the proximity to the road network heading towards my work location.  The Poblenou area has a lot of great restaurants and the beach is an easy walk from the hotel.  The hotel tailors to business and hosted several events during the week.  I had access to the Level which included a lounge with appetizers and drinks in the evening as well as concierge service.  Breakfast was good and the views excellent from the 24th floor.  The rooms did not include irons but could be requested.  I parked on site and the front desk validated parking each day for a discount.  Overall, the service was excellent and the rooms were always clean.  I would stay here again."
5411,"Firstly location is really great, at the starting point of Rambla and very close to Passaig De Gracia metro station. The  rooms are clean, housekeeping service is very good. At the reception, Yuanna and Abdullah are great, just like a friend"
5412,"No ac, so room was hot.  Worst noticed in morning if day 1 my room was the floors emergency exit.  Yellow button let any one in world in my room.  Staff claimed no other room.  Checked out early  Wall warps in front of toilet so must sit at a diagnose.  I checkout early and switches hotels  For 450 a night truly awful.  Stayed st nicer motel 6.   "
5413,Stayed here for three nights on business hotel main tower needs to be renovated    Was more of a Chinese hotel then Western Hotel chain    Breakfast was very good food left a lot to be desired that with dinner   Went to get change at the front desk several nights in a row and was met with little bit of a half and rolling of the eyes  I meant look elsewhere the next time I come to Shanghai
5414,Toilet running all night but thanks to the ear plugs it kept it quite. No soap on the first night. Lack of storage space for the BVD's. Complimentry water and coffee. Parking was very limited but the valet service was great.
5415,"Great concept hotel, excellent location on the river bank, close to the wall, very good breakfast, cool DJ's, helpful receptionists at the desk with lots of good will and a smile, very pleasant and inviting atmosphere. "
5416,"Very friendly and helpful staff.  The decor of the room appealed as did the large bed, coffee machine, balcony and TV.  The air conditioning was also very good.  The room was clean and the bathroom had everything you'd need.  We were upgraded on arrival to an executive room which was a lovely and unexpected surprise.  We found the position of the hotel ideal to wander out and explore Paris.  Checkout was midday and there are pleasant and comfy seating areas positioned around the reception/bar. For me and my wife, the hotel and its ambience was perfect."
5417,"Its a good hotel to stay in. Quiet and decently big rooms to make your stay comfortable. If your stay comes included with breakfast then the spread is good and the coffee just amazing. Staff at reception and restaurant and pleasant and helpful. The only reason I scored less was because of rhe housekeeping. The few days that we have been here, we noticed that the housekeeping was loud. Usually, they arrive in Team of two, one Lady staff and the other a Man. The first day, the guy yelled at the lady in front of us and dint keep it down despite the guest being around. The next day, they were so loud that we realised they were coming even before they entered the room. The room is opened immediately after the first knock. This means the guest would not even have the time to respond,…"
5418,"When arriving at the hotel, they had the wrong reservation dates.  So, the reservation agent had to create two new reservations.  On the second day, we had to get new keys.  When we got back to the room, the keys didn't work.  So, we went back downstairs.  Got new keys.  Then, went back up to the room, the keys didn't work.  By the third try, the hotel agent had to go back with us to the room and get the keys to work.  The agent was extremely sweet and said that a nice discount would be applied to our room for the hassle.  No discount was ever applied.  Matter of fact, I was told that no notes on this incident were even in the computer.  One week after checking out of our room, we found out that the hotel charged us for an additional night.  So, now we had to spend more time contacting the hotel to get.a credit.  At one point, the manager came on the line, and his response to all of this, ""I'm sorry, I can't hear you right now.  Hello, hello.""  If the line truly was bad, wouldn't a manager call you back?  Nothing.  I never write a review on a hotel, but I didn't want anybody to have a similar experience.…"
5419,"I am currently winding down a month of business travel to many different cities - urban and rural - and so I have stayed in my fair share of hotels lately. I don't write reviews often, but felt compelled to because this hotel is definitely the absolute worst one I have stayed in. To start, there is no parking (which, to be fair, I knew in advance) and it is a nightmare trying to find a spot, especially if you're lugging a suitcase with you. The room is just bizarre; what looks cute online does not look so cute in person. The beds are tiny and the mattresses are ridiculously loud and groan with the slightest movement. I was just getting ready for bed at midnight (had an important meeting at 8am the next morning) when my ""neighbors"" arrived...I thought I was imagining things when…"
5420,This Hotel is everything everyone has said of it. The service and assistance given by the staff was fantastic. They were so incredibly helpful and did so because they enjoyed providing the service.   My room was comfortable and quiet and the air con helped!! 👍  The open bar from 6-9 every evening is a unique and welcoming concept. Chance to talk to other guests or read a paper over a quiet drink.   I cannot speak highly enough of this place. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and will return if I have the opportunity.   Thank-you. 
5421,"Stay with caution! Overall, the front staff was nice and friendly. Checkin was quick and easy. Unfortunately, that's the only good thing I can say about my experience there.   My family (of 6) drove 6 hours to Rosemount for a concert. We arrived early and checked in. The front ladies were great and very friendly. After checking in, we decided to head to Chinatown and grab a late lunch before settling into our hotel room. THANKFULLY, we did! Within 45 mins of getting into our room, we noticed a small, brown oval shaped insect on the white sheets. When I took a closer look, I noticed it was a bed bug (which I'm very familiar with from my research in undergrad). Of course, it only took a few seconds to confirm this via our friend the ""Internet.""   As soon as we saw the bed bug, my…"
5422,"Rooms were terrible, it looked like a time warped holiday inn from the 90s. Bathroom was gross with ripped shower curtain, and black mold everywhere.  There is nothing about this hotel that qualifies it as a supposed 4 star hotel. Be aware when booking and only compare it to the older 3 star or 2 star hotels. The photos are deceiving to make it look like a much nicer hotel than it really is.  Had to switch rooms the first night due to a broken safe, ripped shower curtain and blood like stains on the carpet. Outside of the pretty lobby the hotel is extremely beat up.  Location is central and staff were nice. Giving review 2 stars as that is what this hotel is."
5423,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. The location is great (Born / Gothic area). The concierge is wonderful and helped me make dinner reservations and museum reservations. The breakfast exceeded expectations and the dining room staff are friendly and helpful. The room was spotless and beautifully designed. I ordered room service one night and was very happy. One of the best features the hotel offers each guest is a Handy phone, a phone I could use around the city for calls, GPS and internet, free of charge. Excellent feature!!"
5424,"This Hotel could be very good if it were run properly . Restaurant is a shambles they place bread cutting board in front of the worst toaster ive ever experienced in my travels it takes 15 mins to just about turn the bread a light tan whilst your waiting people are cutting bread pushing and shoving past you this was our second stay here we  pointed out this problem some 6 months ago but no improvement so they dont take notice of the questionnaire your asked to fill in about the hotel , room service just about passes its a shame it could be a great place fantastic location"
5425,Nice hotel to stay in Paris. Rooms are small but nice. Good gym downstairs and simple but good breakfast. Service is excellent and reception super helpful. Would definitely come back! Thanks Eden Hotel! 
5426,"We spent there 4 nights. Lovely, clean, small hotel, very friendly staff, good located. Unfortunaltely our room was very very small, for those price we expected something bigger. Breakfast was ok, but we would welcome some vegetable.  Our room was situated opposite the lounge area (breakfast) so from 7 in the morning we could not sleep because throught the door was everything very noisy, voices of people, voices from cleaning mashine."
5427,"We had great time. Very good location, minutes from public transportation. room was very clean and tidy with all the required accessories. Staff was nice and helpful. Lots of dining options in the area. "
5428,"I chose this hotel only because I traveled by train from the Oriente station in Lisbon, and it is close to the airport. The price was also reasonable. I had no other reason. Its a good place if you do the things I described before. It is not close to the city or any interesting activities. And it is really a 3 star hotel."
5429,"We loved our stay at the Boutet hotel in the beautiful and quiet Bastille neighborhood.  The location was wonderful, with the metro stop at the end of the street, and many cafes and restaurants to choose from. The staff was especially friendly and helpful, and the hotel was exceptionally clean and nicely decorated. We would certainly stay here again and have already recommended this hotel to others."
5430,"I have nothing bad to say about the hotel. Hands down one of the best in the area, so is the hotel staff. Breakfasts tho... is whole another thing! Buffet style (pastry, cheese) ONLY! Everything else is a’la card. Portions are small. I ordered egg wihites and sirloin... Boy do I wish I took a picture... 🤦‍♂️  It was literally 1!!! Egg white , AGAIN 1!!! and a piece of sirloin that’s as big as half of chihuahua’s turd 💩. I don’t know 🤷🏼‍♂️ what happened to their breakfast but all it did to me is upset my stomach to the point where I went to a supermarket and bought my own food. Oh, btw I am 152lbs soaking wet (about 60kg) At first I thought it was a hiccup... Nope, same thing every damn day! 😑 Mind it costs €22 per day.  One ☝🏼 more thing to finish up my rant... Do yourself…"
5431,"Arrived early at 11:00, however room was available.  Check-in was easy.  Good room.  Nice location, across the street from S-bahn.  Easy waking distance to Postdamer Platz.  Hearty breakfast with good selection."
5432,"I stayed for 1 week. Location is perfect, just 2 mins close to a metro station. Everything was very clean. Breakfast was perfect and service very good. You can walk to the most important stores (Lafayette, Printemps) and also to Place de la Concorde. "
5433,A truly superb venue for a function. Food was absolutely spot on and the service levels were brilliant. The view from the top across Paris is stunning. Great welcome from reception through to cloakroom 
5434,"This hotel is only good if you must stay here, is well located from Faria Lima business centers and corporate offices. Stayed here as it was booked by my company. Rooms are small and furniture is old, looks tired and dirty. Amenities are terrible, soap and shampoo are like caustic soda, so bring yours! Room service is deficient. Staff do not speak english or spanish, so be patient and practice your mimic moves. Food is terrible, if you can go outside do not hesitate. is Very expensive food, poor quality and terrible taste. If you happen to order an omelet be prepared to pay a very expensive one. Very expensive hotel with terrible service, would not stay here if I had to pay for it."
5435,"I don't really have anything positive to say about this hotel.  Even before we arrived the email communication from the staff was poor.  The room was dirty, the staff were not friendly....It was disappointing.  The only redeeming quality is that they allowed us to keep the room until 18:00 complimentary, but I think this was only because we had clearly had such a miserable time there for the past four days that they dared not say no! The location is good, the beach is a short walk away, however if I went back to Rio I would stay somewhere else."
5438,"This hotel had excellent customer service from concierge to housekeeping.  Newer property two blocks from iconic Gaudi building, major shopping and a metro station.  My only issue was that the configuration is a little too hip for its own good...and not family friendly: 1) room lights have four settings that cannot be adjusted - ""night setting""  illuminates two reading lights that can be turned off, but also illuminates two flood lights over the foot of the bed. 2) ""family room"" door configuration is very difficult in that  you open a room door that puts you in a small foyer with two more room doors -  all doors are very heavy fire doors that children cannot open or stub their toes horribly trying. 3) Bathrooms have heavy obscured doors while one of the showers and the bath tub…"
5439,"We stayed at this hotel in the last week of March 2017.  The hotel is located in a quiet neighborhood of Berlin, on less than a 10-minute walk to Charlottenburg Castle. There are bus stops in front of the hotel: one in the direction of the city center while the other will take you within 10 minutes to the airport. The metro station is on a 5-minute walk from the hotel.   There are many very affordable restaurants, stores, bakeries, pubs, supermarkets, hairdressers, salons (etcetera) close to the hotel as well. The staff is polite and helpful and speak beside German also very good English. Information in the hotel (manuals, signs) is displayed in German, English and Dutch. There is an information corner in the lobby where you can grab a coffee or tea or use the internet terminal…"
5440,"While this Marriott proclaims it is a nonsmoking facility and will charge a guest a cleaning fee if they do smoke, what they do NOT do is eject that guest once the infraction occurs. That = even more smoking by the guest.  I have been awake since 2:30 a.m. this morning due to the pervasive stench of cigarette smoking from a nearby room.  Worst stay ever! 3 nights of this crap and an alternative hotel is not an option for me. Very, very disappointed in Marriott and will choose more wisely the next time around."
5441,"We regularly stay in Holiday Inn as it's our preferred choice but this one was such a let down. The room was really tired and dated, it was more 80's cheap motel than 2018 city stay. Around the pool there are plenty of tiles missing so dangerous for younger children. This hotel was not worth the money at all, it is in a great location but a poor state. If I visit SF again I would stay somewhere else and get better value for money and not feel like we have been ripped off. It's a shame because the staff were friendly"
5442,I am staying at Eros Nehru place for the 2nd time. This stay has been well below par. The room itself is not very clean (carpets are stained and seem old). The nightmare was in the bathroom. The lever to activate the hand shower simply comes off!! Its like a pin kept there for no reason!! The exhaust doesnt work either. Disappointed with the same. For a 5 star this is speaks very low of how well they care for customers. Alas i forgot to take pictures of the same. 
5443,"A good hotel in the heart of high end shopping, check in was smooth and staff delightful. Bedroom was comfortable however a little annoying not to have a separate shower, as usual not enough in the way of shower gel etc. The hotel must think only one person is staying in the room! Hotels should take account that many couples shower evening & morning and one shower gel is not enough We ate in the bar that evening which was good with a good selection, service was excellent. Breakfast was very good however very very busy which probably you can’t do much about, not much space to move around in the restaurant due to it being full. Would certainly use this hotel again if in the area."
5444,"We stayed for 6 days this july - me, my wife and two sons - and it was a very pleasant time. The hotel is confortable, convenient (near a big square, nice and cam neighborhoo, restaurants and commerce, two or more metro lines, etc). The rooms are clean and non-smoking and ofers a complete breakfast too. I recommend!"
5445,"This hotel is was beautiful and cozy in a great location not too far from Moulon Rouge, but what I really loved about this hotel was the staff. I do not remember the gentlemans name at the front desk, but he made our stay here memorable. Would absolutely come back to this hotel for another visit!"
5446,"Unacceptable! They are liars and lazy   The welcome and treatment given to guests by the reception of this hotel is deplorable! The staff lies to you and makes no effort to respond to your requests.  The worst example of their pitiful bad faith: - we had booked many rooms for a stay of more than a week  - despite the quality and pitiful placement of the rooms allocated to us, we accept these rooms - we only ask to change one of these rooms and specify that we agree to pay a supplement - they answer us that everything is complete - we show them a suite available in their hotel on a renowned booking site  - they tell us that this is a mistake and that everything is truly complete - we announce to them that we will have to make people leave the hotel for whom we were asking for a…"
5448,"Kids were partying and vomiting in the halls, uncomfortable and worn out beds, poor internet service, rundown rooms. Elevators took at least ten minutes. The hotel seems to cater to the young partiers."
5450,"Stayed here for a family event.  Location is great - across from park and farmers market. Paid a fortune for a ‘one bedroom’ which was two claustrophobic (small and low ceilings) triangular rooms.  Poor lighting, lousy a/c worn carpets, non soundproofed windows. It’s an old building so wait for elevators is terrible and stairs smell.  Gym was laughable - tiny, dark and dirty.  Cld have stayed downtown at a nice hotel for less.  I was asked how was my stay at checkout and gave this feedback. Got an indifferent shrug.  But at least it was expensive. "
5451,"Me and my friend went to this place last week end. The position was good but there was a smell of pee in the hall, the breakfast was poor and we were at the 5 floor and the elevator was out of service. The best part is that we pay a lot for three nights. We won't come back."
5452,"Our stay in this beautiful city was made even better by having a great hotel to go back to each evening. Fantastic friendly staff, who were so helpful. Room was clean and tidy. Could have done with a door on the bathroom but facilities were faultless. Would definitely stay here again."
5453,"Was so looking forward to staying at the L Hotel, booked on the strength of such glowing TripAdvisor reviews and wanting to avoid corporate chains. Arrived excited after a long international flight, and waited patiently while the couple ahead were checked in. Felt things start to wrong when they walked out glumly dragging their luggage. Sure enough, the young guy at reception handed us a Post-It note with an address scribbled on it, said there's no room here for you, go to this hotel about 20 blocks away, get the shuttle bus opposite. I wanted to cry. Exhausted, confused in a strange city and given no explanation. No manager was available. Unbelievably the guy had no idea why we were being moved, ""What, you started your shift and was told people were being relocated but didn't…"
5454,"Great place to stay while in Amsterdam, good location for getting around. Lots of good restaurants around. The attractions are not that far to walk to or you can take the tram. You just have to watch out for the bicycles they are everywhere."
5455,"We stay at the Stanford court , but we like to go to diferentes places...so we decide to go and have a drink thinking that because is the Fairmont the service would be great......guess what.....after 20 min. been seated we make a decision of leave the place and complaint about the service. The answer....are you a guest at the hotel????. Really???"
5456,"Hotel was very close to the city attractions. Hotel room was great, pool and spa were also great. We had a burnt out light-bulb and after contacting the front desk, a repair man came quickly to replace the light. Overall experience was great and I would go back again."
5457,"I am a Marriott Titanium Elite for life.  I send over 600 nights.  By far this is the worst hotel I ever stay.  The staff don’t care, or actually don’t know what customer service mean.  At the check in I asked if the room was feather free, as I have asthma, they told me yes it was.  Big surprise the room was not feather free. The following day I asked again to make sure the room need to be father free, and the agent told me well, is not in your profile.  Which was not the case as is on my profile, and I asked the agent during my check in and he confirm was feather free.  The hotel have issues with cleaning, the room suppose to be clean every day, my son left some cookies in the floor, and during our 4 day stay, never was clean it.  The ac filters And vents are very dirty.  I…"
5458,"Very near the castle and they have a bus service to the airport.  You get what you pay for. Newly renovated rooms, breakfast and nice staff. It is located next to a Vietnamese restaurant and a grocery.  Will definitely go here again!"
5459,"We booked a room via Hotwire where you can choose the number of adults but not the number of beds and don't know until booking what hotel you are going to get. We needed two beds, so at check-in we asked for that. We were told we could have a room with one queen bed or there was a surcharge of $20 per night for a room with two beds. With minor grumbling we paid the extra charge (one queen bed being out of question for us) and had a decent stay. Back home, we checked the hotel web site and found to our surprise that the price difference between the two room types is only $10/night.  Pulling money out of a customer's pocket by doubling the price differential and making use of the fact that the customer has limited choice at check-in time is very dishonest. I can accept a slightly…"
5460,"I organized a nice celebration for my wedding anniversary and I was quite disappointed with the lack of special attention from the reception and concierge staff. I carefully pre-booked by room requesting a special view and all I have got was the parking lot view, although I had organized a nice small event specially for my wedding anniversary no one knew about it at check-in and no nice/ romantic welcome was expecting for us in our room. At the end the experience wasn’t complete and special as we expected. The food & drink team was amazing helping me put the celebration together, but we never got a nice welcome in our room like we are used to receive in hotels at this ‘category’ and clearly they don’t value little details. Plus, all my guests received considerable upgrades for…"
5462,"Check-in was fast, friendly and efficient.  Had a room on the 7th floor.  Some Non-smoking rooms had the doors open and guests wee smoking in the the rooms - horrendous smell hit you as you got out of the lift.  Tried to use welcome drink vouchers at 23:00 but was told the bar was closed.  Tried to change towels with Jack on reception but he laughed and said that this could not be done until 08:00 when housekeepers were working.  WiFi was quick.  Chose to eat breakfast elsewhere as It catered mainly to Chinese taste."
5463,"DO NOT STAY HERE! This hotel is horrible. We arrived at 11:30 am and were told we couldn't check in until 4:00. I wasn't happy about this at all but we made do, walked around outside, went to eat, etc. We came back at 4:00 and the guy behind the desk, Chester, tells me in a very casual way ""Sorry your room won't be ready until 5:00"". So I flipped out on him and the manager comes out. She takes one look at the list of rooms and says ""Well why didn't you just put them in another room?"" and we get checked in to different room (which he could've done at like 1:00 pm I'm sure, the place was not busy). Every staff member behind the desk was lazy, sloppy and had NO CLUE what was going on.  The room was DIRTY, the pull out queen-sized sofa was unbearable. As others have said, it hurt…"
5464,"You got what typu can expect for 3 star standard. Clean,  quiet, typical, German breakfast. Nothing to complain but also nothing special. Convinient location, large, free parking. Nice, friedly service."
5465,"Amazing view from the rooms and great location but subpar service and dated rooms. In general, we enjoyed our stay being able to walk to most destinations. First we got a room that smelled of smoke but quickly got changed to a different floor. After that, we had no problems until we accidentally broke a glass in the room and the hotel wanted to charge us 75 RMB (11 USD) at check out to replace it, which we quickly denied to pay. The front desk staff started a street-market-like discussion offering a better price. We stood our ground, got our credit card deposit cancelled and walked out. A very disappointing ending to our stay. I might have understood (but not agreed with) a RMB 15 replacement charge, but this was just bad service and trying to make a buck out of everything."
5466,"We picked this hotel mainly due to it location. Situated on the corner of the harbour (step outside and you are within touching distance of all the Yachts). It’s a 2minute walk to Promenade de la Croisette and a 7-8 minute walk to the train station.   The hotel entrance sits on the road around the harbour leading to “PdlC” which in the evenings is home to a regular street market and a few restaurants so there’s always a good vibe but not too loud or rowdy like the main square/PdlC.   The private beach is across the road and again due to location you have unobstructed views of the sea/coastline etc unlike staying on the opposite side of the harbour.   The staff were awesome, always pleasant and nothing was too much of an ask.   Breakfast is great, lots of fresh healthy options as…"
5467,"My wife and I were booked into this hotel by our travel agent. The name of the hotel  given to us was the City Hotel Berlin Mite on arrive we found that the name had changed to the Wyndham Gardens hotel a little off putting but no major problem.  The hotel was really excellent. The staff could not have been more helpful  and nothing was too much trouble. We stayed in room 210 which was a very good room but it had sloping eves at my wife's side of bed and being disabled she found the access difficult, having said that I am sure if I had asked they would have changed my room. The other thing that would have made the room perfect for us would have been a bath as this would have helped my wife's condition after a long days walk.  The area of the hotel had mainly Turkish kebab shops…"
5468,"I love this place , In center of Paris next to restaurants , shops and fine rooms staffs excellent any problems solved  .If you wish a rest , seat ins along and have a break with  free drink , coffee , snack areal hight 3 star hotel . A lot of small restaurants in small street next .Really recommend this Hotel"
5469,"The room was very stuffy. We woke up coughing every morning.  It is an old hotel so I’m not sure if it was musty, but we both were very congested and uncomfortable.  The thermostat was set as low as it would go - 65 - and it was still warm in the room.   We stayed in 1222 and about 11:30PM each night we would start hearing loud music from a bar that would last until about 3:30AM. On the 3rd night we had had enough and called the front desk asking for ear plugs and the manager got on the phone and sarcastically told us to call security or the police of the music was too loud.   And I would also mention that if you want to check in before 4PM, plan on paying $30 for early check in.   We travel a lot and room is ready we have never been charged extra to check in early.  The woman…"
5470,"We stayed here as a couple over a weekend in Rio. A well located hotel and staff are helpful, although the hotel and rooms are run down and tired with several issues - our room had a damp smell and the aircon was so ancient that you couldn't adjust the temperature. Walls were paper thin and we had to put up with listening to the tv playing constantly in the room next door which was as loud as if we were playing it ourselves! Overall a disappointing stay and I would not recommend this hotel until it has had a much needed refurb."
5471,"Here's my experience.​​  I was supposed to stay at the Torel 1884, a sister hotel, but was moved there.  Welcome: OK, nothing special to say. the guy was polite but that's all.   Room: the one I had (31) was roomy and clean but the designer of the room apparently seemed to think that its design was more important than its practicality.  Situation: too far from the center. 10-min walk at least of anything.  Bathroom/toilets: very noisy and annoying sliding glass doors. Shower controls impractical. Sink cabinet too small.  Bed: confortable, but two mattresses with a big gap between, not appropriate for a couple.  Breakfast: so-so, not to the level of a 5-star. The view outside (few tables) is nice, though.  I accidentally broke a ill-designed table in their room. Actually just a…"
5473,"We stayed in this hotel for 2 nights at the beginning of September. The location is not central however, it is a very nice residential area, with several bakeries, couple of restaurants offering international cuisine. The best part however was our spacious room. The interior design of the hotel reflects the aesthetics of 90s, a litte outdated but ok. There is tram top right in front of the hotel so you can be at Alexanderplats in 10 minutes. I would stay here again!"
5474,"Easy walk from Gare de l'Est, studio room was very clean, modern and comfortable (with a/c!), kitchenette (although no dishes, just a few glasses), storage, quiet and secure, nice bathroom.  No lift.  Receptionist was attentive to our requests.  Restaurant was also very good, with reasonable prices."
5475,"The hotel is pleasant and the staff helpful. The apartments are well equipped for self catering. The two ring burner was broken on our arrival but we were supplied with a kettle as soon as I reported the fault. It was a hotel wide problem which was resolved in a day or two. There was table linen, cork screw, a selection of pans and utensils for those who like to cook and eat in the apartment. The pool area was clean and well tended, there was never a problem getting a lounger.   The beach was just a stones throw from the hotel. It is a beautiful clean beach too. My only problem was, the distance to a shop, bar or restaurant. Petty, perhaps. For me with slight walking difficulties it meant a taxi ride both ways. A total of 10 euro added to a shopping bill. There were a few older…"
5476,"We Have family living in Chicago and have visited over 10 hotels in downtown.  This was by far the worst.  Have stayed in 4 and 5 star hotels for $250. The city was very booked so we got screwed $300 plus dollars for the worst corner room in the place which I might add was booked on trip advisor.  Saw other rooms and this was the smallest and smelled like smoke even though it was non smoking.  The room was clean.  Extremely noisy on the street.  They claim to have good sleep amenities in their brochure.  They include lumpy pillows, average bed and ear plugs to drown out the noise.  The front desk is totally worthless.  Not courteous, texting and when we asked for a concierge for dinner, they didn't know what that was. Fitness center was okay but very dirty.  The diner and bar…"
5477,"I stayed at the hotel for 7 days in March, 2019. They took away the hand towers and don't offer clean new ones. They also take away the pajamas and never replace them. At the check out, they sneak in a charge of R$9.00 for a chocolate that I didn't consume. Please avoid this hotel. Also, AC barely works."
5478,"We stayed in a one bedroom apartment for 3 nights. Good location but the rooms were very worn, website pictures are misleading. Rooms were not serviced during our 3 day stay - you need to take out your own garbage, etc. "
5480,"I stayed here a month ago, after reading MANY fantastic reviews. People seemed very happy and in awe of the place, so I thought "" this is definitely worth booking ! ""   When I arrived, I was very impressed with the service. Top drawer. The young girl was very friendly, spoke fantastic English and showed me everything I needed to know.  The location again - superb. 2 minutes jog to the nearest underground, food places near by etc. Very happy.  The room - superb. FANTASTIC double bed, very well presented, very clean and tidy.  The bathroom again - shared but no issue. Very clean, tidy. There was two fantastic shower rooms.  They had two laptops you could use at your leisure on a lovely sofa, free of charge. Another good perk.  Breakfast - Again, top marks. Lovely breakfast, all I…"
5481,"My room key kept getting demagnetize for three days and when I asked the front desk for help, she told me very rudely that it was not her problem, that I would have to come down to the front desk every time this happen, that it was my fault for putting my card near my credit cards or cell phone.  Apparently, she doesn't know that is a myth and that it was her problem.  Also, the night before my departure I kept getting a group of people knocking on my door and trying to enter my room, I felt not safe.  The breakfast is good and the distance to everything is perfect.  Room could be much cleaner."
5482,"Bad experience, room, bathroom laid out poorly Analog TV etc.  Cork board walls , housekeeping didn't restock room food or beverages .........Not Good@!  No restaurant open Sunday on arrival and very limited food choices."
5483,"Rooms ambience is not so good, somehow attracts negativity Amenities should be present before check in Mosquitoes repellent and pest control required Improve food variety and taste at buffet breakfast "
5484,Nice modern hotel with friendly staff and great rooms.  Nice privacy policy so you are not unduly disturbed.  Sweeties were a nice touch. Excellently placed for visiting so many places and literally 2 streets away from the rail station. Will definately be staying there next time we visit.
5486,"I stayed here for one night, and loved everything about it. The owners are so friendly and welcoming, and very helpful. There is a lot of information in the room if you don't know the area.  They have free parking at the B&B, and it is very easy to get a bus into the centre of Cannes for €1.50.  It is only a 5 minute walk to the golden beaches, so everything is very accessible.  The rooms are very comfortable, with ceiling fan, large wardrobe, Apple TV etc. There is also access to a shared living and kitchen area. The bathroom is also shared.  The breakfast is amazing! Everything you can imagine, homemade breads, croissant, sweet treats, fruit, yogurt, cereals etc.   Fabulous choice to stay and great value for money.  Would definitely return. "
5488,"The hotel had an interesting look but it didn't feel warm.  The rooms were ok but mirrors were in unexpected places and no outlets in the bathroom.  The restaurant experience was not good for us neither at dinner nor breakfast.  I felt we were treated ok at the reception desk but there was a cold business like feel.  Though in Lisbon, some staff didn't speak Portuguese nor Spanish. "
5489,"Hotel Récamier and staff were the ideal selection for our romantic weekend. The location is perfect for shopping, dinners, exploring... looking forward to returning as soon as possible. Highly recommended!"
5490,The Westin Gran Berlin is a fantastic Marriott property.  It is located in a nice neighborhood.  The service at the hotel is great and the suites are fantastic.  They also have great room service offered 24 hrs/day.
5491,If you’re looking for a place to sleep this hotel does the job. The rooms are quiet small but the beds are comfy. The location of the hotel itself is great nice quiet neighborhood close to the main attractions/walking or riding distance. The breakfast is mediocre compared to other Leonardo hotels in Europe so if you want a decent feed I recommend going out to get breakfast it will probably cost the same as the hotel buffet but you will get better food. The bathroom layout is completely wrong the way the shower is designed makes water go everywhere and the floor gets so slippery so be careful. They could probably do with getting the shower glass fixed rather than it being a door and better drainage.   Otherwise the stay was enjoyable. Comfortable & quiet but definitely well over…
5492,"And with a reasonable investment I turn this hotel into one of the best in the world! The reason why I love this hotel is its location and a building which is structurally sound with large rooms and perfect terraces that offer a perfect view over the Ocean. Positive is also that the hotel is very clean and that the rooms are taken care of each day. BUT there is enormous room for improvement! The pricing policy is absurd, the Wi-Fi is unworkable, the people at the reception are friendly but incompetent, the bathrooms need to be modernised, the whole staff in the kitchen should be replaced. The food served is just an insult to one's taste-buds and the bar is not worth a second visit! With a different management and some structural changes (such as an elevator that goes down all…"
5493,"This hotel is very nice. It is very well placed because from the hotel you can have access to metro, bus and other means of transport easier. The hotel is clean, although rooms are quite small but the have all the accomodities of a 4 stars hotel.. this is a place to ve when you have business in paris."
5494,"The hotel itself is in a good location, however very dated and with exceptionally slow lifts (only 1 lift servicing 10/11th floor).   Upon checking in my card was charged an additional 160$ which we were not made aware of. The receptionist merely asked for the card we had already paid with which we assumed was for security confirmation. Once we saw the charge later that day we questioned it and were told it’s a refundable security deposit which would be refunded as soon as we checked out.   It has now been 11days since we checked out and left San Francisco and yet the money has not been refunded. I have contacted member services who had no answer to this- and I am still waiting for a resolution and my money back.   This is not acceptable !! Had we been told this amount would be…"
5495,I visited Berlin last week for a conference at the Bristol Hotel in central Berlin. For me the location was very good within walking distance from metro station and close to some of the main shopping areas.  Staff was friendly and spoke fluent English. The room was good in size and had the amenities I would expect and it was all clean and well maintained. Internet connect was a bit on the slower side by today's standards.  The breakfast was very nice with a good assortment and was nicely prepared in an inviting setting.
5496,"The Ritz Carlton in Berlin lives up to the quality of the brand! The rooms are gorgeous, spacious and well fitted. The breakfast was lacking custom made omelettes, pancakes etc. There was not a plate of fruit in my room. So still a few things missing but in all it was a fabulous experience. "
5497,"I stayed at the hostel for one night and it cost about 40€.   The atmosphere in the room was a little uncomfortable. I've never known a hostel to have queen beds in the rooms, but lo and behold a naked sleeping couple upon arrival. The queen bed atmosphere had people paired off, so it didn't have the typical hostel spirit of getting to know fellow travelers.   The location was great, just a 5 minute walk from Centraal Station. Breakfast was good and checking in/out went very smoothly."
5498,The Location was beautiful pool was ok although they ran out of ice at the bar and staff member made no effort to refill. Breakfast was very basic.  Our room was very small and had a strong damp smell. The exit light in the room was on all day and night making difficult to sleep. Cleaners did a great job each day. We had high expectations with this facility considering it was one of the most expensive we had stayed in on our trip. Would not recommend.
5500,"Nice stay at Mark apart hotel. the  room was big, cleanless, good location with plenty of shops and restaurants , metro is around 5 minutes walk from the hotel. The hood is quiet and safe. I recommend this hotel  "
5501,"So me and my wife booked this hotel at late notice for an unexpected trip to Barcelona, the pictures looked good and it was very reasonable.  Upon arrival we came into reception & were offered drinks of our choice and then swiftly given our room key cards. We got to the rooms and again surprised at the size, we bought pictures made the rooms look quite small, they aren’t at all. You don’t have a separate bathroom but the way it’s designed it feels like you have. Beds were huge and very comfortable, Small wardrobe with hangers. The rooftop pool was small but nice if you can get a bed, the pool is shallow so nice to sit in if it is busy. The hotel runs free cocktail or wine tasting in the evening, we did the cocktail one and it was good fun.  Only couple of negatives stopping us…"
5502,"A very average 3 star hotel 4 miles from the centre of Funchal. We sopped on the eighth floor or minus 8 as the hotel is built in to a cliff, with reception being at the top. Ten floors in all, and down to the swimming pool. Not an ideal place if you aren't energetic. No lift from hotel to the pool. After a few steps, a very steep incline around 200 metres long. The bedroom needed refurbishment. Coffee facilities; pay for a kettle and supply your own coffee, tea, sugar and milk. No fridge, pay for one to be supplied. No air con, not even fitted, so I don't know what happens when it gets really hot. As normal, some staff nice, some hard work. Restauraunt needs refurb, food average, and got boring a few days in. NEW YEARS EVE - the hotel excelled themselves; lovely meal with…"
5503,"Stayed here for 5 nights, great location as opposite a beautiful beech. 20 min walk to the marina, 30 mins to centre of town. Very outdated apartment.. No kettle, takes an hour to boil water on hob!!! Beds not the most comfortable. If your looking for cheap holiday... Ideal. Reception staff not that friendly"
5504,"Booked this as there was a conference in Chicago and nothing else was available. Paid over $200/night and really not worth it. The hotel is in a URGENT need of renovation. Its old and dated. Really will not be back. There is a restaurant linked to the lobby, not the best food but the lady there (Barbara) is really nice so she makes it worthwile."
5505,"Booked 4 weeks in advance to get 2 rooms next to each other for 3 adults & toddler. Upon booking was told would not be an issue. On arrival were told not possible and given rooms on the 7 & 3 floors which was not convienent for our needs.  The portacot for the toddler had a hole that the child could put her head through and possibly choke. When we asked for another one were simply told it was not possible.  The rooms were mediocre, TVs had poor reception, only 1 bathrob in each room & no slippers.   Bathrooms were pretty outdated looking more like something from the 80's.  The one thing I guess it had going for it was the continental breakfast but be weary because the foods were not labelled correctly.  We will not be returning as at 1200RMB a night per room we expected what we…"
5506,"Carefully check your laundry invoices because you easily can be overcharged. You should not  expect to receive any special recognition when you stay for more than 9 nights. I stayed there for 9 and even though I woud not expect to receive any special treatment, a kind word of recognition would have been appreciated."
5507,"It's nearly 2 AM as I write this review.  I get woken up to this intense buzzing noise coming from the bathroom.  I call down to the front desk to see if I can get someone to come look at the issue.  The noise is loud, loud enough to wake me, and it seems as though it's getting louder, certainly loud enough to wake others on the floor.  An engineer comes up, and evidently the toilet needs some part replaced.  The hotel is fully booked, so no other room is available for me to switch to, so I sit, in the middle of the night and wait...    This kind of thing happens, I realize that, no big deal.  I stay in hotels almost 100 nights a year, you're going to get some bad luck occasionally.  The hotel staff displayed almost a complete lack of interest, or concern. ZERO apology for the…"
5508,Very helpfull desk. Spaceous and clean rooms.  Coffee and tea facilities in the room Parkingfacilities directly next to the hotel.  Metro station 5 minute walk and busstation 2 minute walk.  All in all great hotel in a great city. 
5509,"This is one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. The only redeeming quality is the location. After only one night in the hotel, I decided there was absolutely no way I could stay there. This cost me two nights that were already paid for but it was well worth the money to get out of this dump!  The towels were filthy and rough, I didn't even feel comfortable using them. The hallways are run down and there are basically no outlets in the room. The stairways are disgusting as well and the hotel is listed among the most haunted in America. The service was horrible as well. Whoever owns this establishment has zero pride in their business."
5510,"Clean, friendly and great location for a weekend break. Transport links were good with bus, tube and taxi's all within a few hundred meters. Also very close to some of the Tourist Attractions. Rooms were functional and clean with very comfortable beds. Staff were pleasant and helpful."
5511,"Really elegant hotel in a quiet area of Mitte - 15 minute walk to Alexanderplatz train station, 10 minutes to museum island, roughly 20/25 minutes to Checkpoint Charlie and Potsdamer Platz. Clean and Spacious rooms, huge shower and even a small kitchen facility with a fridge and this was a standard double room. Friendly staff and a great downstairs bar that did amazing cocktails. Would highly recommend. "
5512,"This hotel was amazing! My husband and I originally booked this based on price but upon arrival realized the absolute true value in what we got for our money! The staff here were beyond helpful and courteous. Thomas, front desk, was always willing to offer advice on where to go, french pronunciations :), and anything additional that we might ask. The rooms were cute, well taken care of, super clean and offered air conditioning! Hotel location was perfect and once we figured out where it was realized it was in the heart of the district and so easy to navigate to the rest of the city.  We also signed up for the breakfast in the mornings and there was American style coffee which I desperately needed. The breakfast offerings were wonderful and provided us a great start to our days.…"
5513,"I was looking forward to my trip. My flight was an early morning arrival so my travel service telephoned to add an extra night to the start of my booking, so I could check in early. Unfortunately the person at the hotel who took the call (I was able to give his name) did nothing with the information. So I arrived from Bogota, tired and grumpy, to find no record of the early check-in and no rooms available. Cross doesn't begin to explain it. Fortunately a room was found almost immediately, but even when I was able to give the name of the person who took the booking no apology was forthcoming or even an 'I will look into what happened'. Very poor. Then to find that breakfast is served in another building across the street. Not great when you're travelling for business. No time for…"
5514,"We loved this hotel!  It has a wonderful location - walking distance to many major sites including La Rambla, Barri Gotic, Casa Batllo, shopping on Passieg de Gracia and a nearby metro stop.  The lobby is beautiful, the staff is friendly and the rooms are well appointed.  The rooftop plunge pool and lounge chairs are a bonus.  Although the rooms are small, the bathroom was very nice and had great soaps, etc. We did have to give the address to cab drivers as it's not very well known.  (I think it may have changed names rather recently.)   Highly recommend."
5516,My stay at this Hotel was most enjoyable.  My husband and I were very thankful for the air-conditioning in our room.    Steigenberger Hotel Berlin (Los Angeles Platz) is our favourite.  Centrally located to important places in Berlin.   
5517,Reasonably priced. Extremely helpful staff. Everywhere you turned from waiters to the cleaning team they were all friendly and willing to offer assistance. The property was clean. My room was well appointed. The location was amazing. Several different dining experiences all on site with additional options nearby.
5518,"We have been coming for 6 years now. Sadly, the rooms are looking a little more worse for wear. (We stayed in two)The pool was only heated the first week of our stay, even though we are told October is a peak month. Various things in the apartment were broken. One of the two lifts was not working properly. 'Did you not report this?' I hear you say....No, this year we just decided not to, as we were tired and looking forward to a nice apartment...it is time that pestana put a little money into fixing these issues. On a positive note we will be coming back next year. The staff are always lovely. Hopefully there will be some improvement and we are allocated an apartment of our choice."
5519,Bad experience as the hotel charge me extra of approx one hundred dollars without telling me and they never explain me someting else that it is for three bath items and they never refund me. i wrote this week 2 times and they don't answer. i hope that the manager of this hotel will read my post and as this i will be able to delete this bad comment. I travel a lot and it is the first time i had a bad experience like this. i m not happy
5520,It was a nice experience in general and I'd definitely recommend it. The only bad experience I had was when I wanted to use the self check-in platform that worked a bit buggy and lost me about an hour. Except that everything was super nice.
5521,"The paradise Honolulu aims to be turned out in an anticlamax after arriving in the hotel. Despite a promised parking place we needed to look for parking space by ourselfs. After searching for more then half an hour there suddenly was one available, despite earlier claims. To be fair, we didn't need to pay anymore which was somewhat of an solution. Seeing the room was the next dissapointment. The five beds we booked were stuffed in a big twopwrson bedroom. The beds was way too small to normally lay down let alone to sleep in. The location however was relative good. This could have been a great hotel, if only the service would have been good. The staff just weren't nice people at all."
5522,"I checked into the hotel on Friday July 12th with my friend to celebrate her sister's birthday weekend. I used Fontainebleau's valet parking on Friday afternoon with no problems. I checked out of valet on Saturday to drive down the Collins strip and returned maybe 45 minutes to Fontainebleau valet. When I pulled into valet, one of the valet tenants took my keys from me and gave me my valet claim check ticket. I enjoyed my Saturday with the birthday girl. When I went to pickup my vehicle with my claim ticket, I was told that the valet didn't have my keys. But, I received a claim ticket on Saturday from the Fontainebleau attendant when he latched my keys to his key holder with other keys. I was advised by Kenneth (Manager) that he was told the guest had the key. I tried to explain…"
5524,"Excellent hotel room, setup like a small service timeshare apartment.  Staff was superb with an outstanding restaurant attached to the hotel.  Located very near this Hackescher Markt so we had  multiple selections for restaurants for dinner every night with a variety of food. Saturday, they had a full street faire in the market.  It was a delightful place to stay in Berlin."
5528,"This is a perfect place to stay while you are in Paris in a budget . The rates are great , the rooms are clean , towels are changed in a daily basis .the staff is polite, friendly and accommodate your needs and help you with your questions with transportation or restaurants or everything else. Their professionalism make this place fabulous. The rooms are small like all the rooms in Europe but In my accessible room 101 facing the sampaix road I found the perfect space. I only missed to have hair conditioning , wash cloth and body lotion ( not a big deal) but I bring my own. The last day I discover ( it was written) the hair dryer was at the front desk but I never asked for it.the big advantage over the other hotels is have air conditioning unit that works perfectly and the…"
5529,As usual the hotel staff were friendly. very helpful and extremely polite. The rooms were clean and comfortable. The location was very good with the Metro just outside and the RER just around the corner.
5531,"We arrived to pure chaos... the reception was so disorganized that the lobby was full of people and you could barely move. We could not check in because of our arrival time but it was super complicated to get a locker to put our stuff away for a few hours, the ones in the lobby were full and the machine for the ones upstairs was not accepting cards... awful experience trying to get change to use the lockers. PLEASE use common sense and add a change machine or allow the lockers to accept bills. The room was very spacious and comfortable enough. The toilet and shower were in great conditions. A little far from the city but the station is right beside the hostel. Would hesitate to come back here."
5532,"the staff were all great, hotel was clean and comfortable,however we booked a mountain view room and even though we were on the 7th floor the only view of the mountain was thin strips between the high buildings at the rear. Directly behind the hotel is a busy road making it almost impossible to relax on the balcony.we found the food poor on the whole,bacon at breakfast was barely cooked and sitting in a tray of grease. there was little choice for main course at dinner, the vegetable selection in particular was poor and there never appeared to be a vegetarian main. we would go back to Madeira but not, unfortunately to this hotel."
5533,Excellent boutique hotel in a very convenient location. Wonderful staff who even humoured me and my attempts to communicate in the French tongue.   Will definitely stay there again next time I am in Paris and will highly recommend to friends.
5534,"This hotel is perfectly located in the middle of the shopping area of Chiado.  No noise if you get a room on the far side (facing the Castle) of the building.  The bar is memorable with great city views....the food in the bar is also good.  We had a couple of light meals there-very good food.  The staff in the bar are all great and make wonderful drinks!!  Breakfast is adequate...nice light room. I'd suggest a premium room as it is on the bar level, has an outside deck and overlooks the city...really perfect after a day of sightseeing. We had problems with the air conditioning is 2 separate rooms (not working or inadequate).  The staff was very concerned although they were unable to address the problem. It would appear the property does not have a maintenance person available. I…"
5535,"Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights beyween 2nd and 4th August 2018. Room was on the 1st floor. Clean and modern room with air conditioning amd good wifi connection. Staff friendly and helpful. Only reason we haven't given it 5 out of 5 is because we think the breakfast, at between 15 and 17 euros and the evening set meal at around 44 euros (as advertised on a board in reception) are too expensive- otherwise a great hotel in a central location. "
5537,"Came here for Easter with my family and we were all excited. I should have known it wasn't going to be great when I made my reservation and the lady was terribly rude. Hotel is nice, beds were ok.... But service is terrible. I won't stay here again."
5538,"Very well situated hotel, especially for the U-bahn, KaDaWe and the nearby gay village. Clean, tidy and peaceful, with ample space in the bathroom, a decent breakfast and efficient staff.  Check in was quick and hassle free"
5539,"Quiet, clean hotel in great location. It's very comfortable for business trip. Breakfast was tasty, maybe not a huge choice but I would not expect such. The whole staff was very nice and professional (maybe except of one lady on reception when I was doing check out- but probably it was just not her best day)."
5540,"Nice, smart and clean ! There is a beautiful view from the last floor which make you feel like in China ! But the low English level of the staff (especially the receptionists) is not acceptable for that kind of Hotel ! Laundry is almost same price as the room."
5541,"Location is the only good thing about this hotel.  Stayed at the Hotel Lincoln since it was a Hyatt hotel and was so disappointed. Not up to Hyatt standards and NOT worth the exorbitant nightly rates. They appear to be trying for a funky boutique type hotel but it is still an old, small, dark building.  The elevators are tiny and banged up, the rooms are NOTHING like is shown in the website.  Do not base a visit to this hotel on the website because you will not get what it appears to offer. The bathrooms are so small, there is no room for your toiletries or any bags of any kind, and you hit your head on the shelf when you lean over the sink.  Only place for the towels is in the shower with you - and a plastic rubber mat for the tub is offered so you don't slip.   Gross. The…"
5542,"Stayed here for 3 nights. For my purposes the hotel was situated perfectly. Close to the metro,and close to the beach for my daily morning walks.  When we arrived there was some confusion with the check in system,leading to the staff being very stressed and not too friendly. The rooms were a little small but clean. And the aircondition was working perfectly.   The hotel has a rooftop with a nice view,and we enjoyed some afternoons here. And there is a small pool. Recommend to order a sangria  from the rooftop bar. Tastes delicious.  The breakfast was really good. Fresh bread,fruits,meats, cheese,and fresh vegetables. And several different yoghurts. If I should complain about anything it would be the coffee.   I will certainly consider to stay here next time I am going to…"
5543,"The location was great, just a short walk from the station. I really liked our room, which was clean and modern.   The staff were the most welcoming and helpful we’ve encountered while travelling.   I would definitely stay here again and probably will!"
5544,"If you don´t want to spend money on accommodation but on sightseeing, go for the offers from Novum Hotel City. They are very good. Hotel location is excellent. Shortest walking distance from U-Bahn (note: till the end of November 2015 the Bülow station is closed due to the reconstruction, therefore take the second closest - Kurfürstenstrasse). Bus station (buses no. M48 for Alexanderplatz and M85 for HauptBahnhof -  you are there in 15min) in front of the entrance to the hotel. If you want to rent a bike, just opposite the street there is nice shop with drinks, the owners are Turks, they rent you bike for 10 Eur/day. Or simply you can walk to the city centre (30min approx.). That is really great. I have not booked the room with breakfast therefore this I cannot comment. There…"
5545,"Excellent location, beautiful decor, rooms very confortable, beds are particularly comfortable. Staff is very friendly, helpful and efficient. Large living room on the main floor for the use of all guests. Large breakfast room as well which doubles for cocktails in the evening. My favorite hotel in Paris for many years."
5546,"I would not let a junkie stay here. Lower staff was good but everyone else forgot what and who pays them to have a job. The rooms are very dated and looking unclean even thought they are. Internet is like dial up even thought there was not that many people staying at the time. Shuttle  to casino is ok, drivers were very nice. Casino looks like it is one step from a old time mafia back room gambling room. Everything is dated. Will never stay here again."
5547,"This hotel was excellent, me and partner are 25 and 24 and booked to stay here for birthday/engagement. The hotel is really well presented with a great selections of clean, funky rooms. Staff speak excellent English and very friendly, free coffee machine/water is great downstairs.   The breakfast is good as offers 50 percent off for guests and will bring to room for breakfast in bed.   Close to Mont Marte, Arc de triomphe and Eiffel tower by using metro. 15 euros if wanting a cab.   Would highly recommend hotel as nice area also. "
5548,"The hotel is well located and close to Gare du Nord if you are coming from London. The room was good size and very clean and the en-suite also was very good size. but what we loved best was the friendliness of the staff, the receptionist was just very nice with a big smile and made us feel like home which we really appreciated. Overall we really liked our stay and we definitely we may come back!"
5549,"Great room in a lovely city, close and convent to everything. The hotel was wonderful every thing convent to get to in hotel. The bed slept very comfortable!  Love this hotel!!!!!!  Can't wait to come back!!!!!!!!  Yes love this place!"
5550,"This hotel was lovey, with good service and the biggest room I have ever enjoyed in Europe.  We ate the continental breakfast at the hotel, and the waitstaff was conscientious and attentive - often waitstaff are not in Europe.    Not labeled 5 -stars, as the location was only OK for me.  Other reviewers loved the location, and it was near multiple railstations and some good resteraunts, but all in all it's in a sleepy part of Berlin.  If you're looking to retire to a quiet space after a full day, this is a perfect place.  If you want to step from your hotel to something exciting, maybe look elsewhere."
5551,"Hotel was nice, clean, friendly reception staff, great breakfast, half an hour walk to main centre.  Holiday was spoiled by the fact my husbands wallet was taken from our room while we were eating breakfast and the manager did not take our complaint seriously."
5553,"The rating is somewhere in between as there are good and bad things to tell. Most of the staff is very nice despite the bad level of English. The room was good and clean everytime they came by, a big thumb up for those people. Food wasn't bad and there was certainly enough quality. The location is very quiet as you're outside the city and almost alone on the beach.  But: The Wifi doesn't work everywhere and not always perfectly. We had to negotiate to include sparkling water in our all inclusive (which they did but apparently it's not the 'standard procedure'). All inclusive is from 10 till 22 which is pretty early. The location being outside the city is a minus as well as there is nothing to do outside the hotel, you need to go to Kamari for some action. Worst of all was the…"
5554,Rude staff and very small room. Parking fees extra not explained in advance as well as retainer fee for potential damages - that won't be credited to your account for 5 or more business days after check out. 
5555,"We stayed in this hotel during our recent trip to Lisbon. We have chosen it as it appeared to be close to the airport, which turned out not to be the case if taking an official taxi from the airport (EUR 20.00 instead of a regular EUR 8.00). The hotel is placed in an area which looks like a business district, therefore it is busy during weekdays, and empty on weekends. The building is not a newest type, but still quite decent. Inside it is very clean and according to Mercure standards. Rooms are spacious and well maintained. A nice touch is a rooftop swimming pool which we have been using a lot during our stay. Some people may like it, some not but you could spot all the planes approaching the Lisbon Airport (sometimes a little bit noisy).  In terms of a service provided,…"
5557,"Stayed four nights in standard double ($95eu, breakfast included). Hotel rooms were very nice and modern with large modern bathroom.  Staff was well trained, friendly and very helpful with directions and sites to see.  (Vitor was especailly helpful)   Breakfast was very good and with nice and good variety. No restaurant on site, and not to many options nearby.  If it had not been for ""Italy Restorante Caffe"" two blocks away on Avenida Duque D'Avilla, this would have been a real problem for us at dinner time.  Best Italian Restorante & Pizzeria in Portugal (good price, great food and the friendliest and best waiters we have had anywhere in the world, a real value and treat for us several different nights).   Hotel needs to upgrade their technologies, no guest computer, and very…"
5558,"Room in serious need of a refurb, not what expected from hotel photos. No kitchen, so no breakfast available and no kettle in room so facilities are very limited. Hallway carpets redone during the day by the lifts during the day on the 7th floor so had to use the stairs."
5559,Bad cleaning service. Bad cleaning service. Bad cleaning service. Bad cleaning service. Bad cleaning service. Bad cleaning service. Bad cleaning service. Bad cleaning service. Bad cleaning service. Bad cleaning service.                              
5560,"I think it's a bit deceiving to call this a Motel but still charge so much money.  The room was fine in size and for what i needed. My issues are no PHONE so you need to go down whenever you need.  There is no ice dispensor or water provided, you have to purchase at the bar.  The breakfast staff was not very friendly especially toward the end of the breakfast hours.  You would ask them for more milk or juice because the containers were empty and there was a bit of attitude.  I also asked for new towels in the morning when i left the hotel and came back in the night to my old towels still on the floor of my bathroom and no new towels so i had go back downstairs (because there's no phones in room) and ask for towels again.  Do i think that experience merits that a room be 100…"
5562,"During the weekend of April 19-21 I booked a room at Shades Resort to escape crowded Ho Chi Minh City. Expecting a pleasant stay at a resort that had received excellent reviews, I was unpleasantly surprised to be given a room adjacent to the parking lot and facing the street. Needless to say, I did not expect to be housed in a room that was literally outside the resort area. It had the feel of being in an American strip mall.   When I expressed my displeasure at the room, the staff (who were all very kind) showed empathy and understood my complaints. Two of the staff members told me I had this room because I was the last person to book a room at the resort. This led me to believe that the resort realizes this is a less-than-stellar room. After reiterating my annoyance with the…"
5563,"Stayed at grandom for 4 nights with 2 kids. We had a 2 bedroom apartment with a kitchen and a large living room dining area . Plenty of room for kids.  The grandson is located off carrer d'arago and convenient to las ramblas, plenty of restaurants and cafes. It's a great option to get away from main tourist area and feel like you are more in a local neighborhood. "
5565,"About the only thing of value in the property was the bed.  The facility was in need of deep cleaning (lots of surface grime on walls, in elevators, in room/ bathroom and on furnishings).  To overcome the filth and grime the lobby was overcompensating with some seriously strong air fresheners that caused nausea and headaches almost immediately upon meeting my olfactory receptors.  My reservation was not filled as reserved, in fact I was placed into a handicapped room because they had let all the rooms of the type I reserved.  Food service from the in-room menu (from a local eatery) was to take 90 minutes, which did not fit into my schedule.  The elevator 15 yards from my room was out of service and I had to walk the entire length of the hotel to the other wing to find the room…"
5566,"My wife and I stayed with a group from a local club, about 38 of us, for four nights, during a coach trip.  The hotel and other trips out were booked for us via a travel agent.  Hotel is modern, only a few years old, built on re-claimed land where an old ceramics factory was previously - part of the factory remains and is in use by the city council (Camara in Portuguese). It is almost on an island, surrounded by an artificial lagoon connected to the city canal system on 3 sides. Around the lagoon is a grassed area and beyond this on two sides are rather nice looking residential apartment buildings. A third side is taken by the refurbished factory, behind which is the railway line from Porto to Lisbon. Final side is rather a mess, car park, waste land and what appears to be a…"
5567,The bedcover smelled old and of someone’s body odor  The overnight person was rude and blamed staff for not coordinating taxi to bring us to airport We saw a small mouse run into dining room and informed staff the women said oh we were trying to catch it like it was nothing and lastly arrived home with a rash bed bugs???
5568,"This Hotel has a perfect location straight against one of the Big Attraction, Barcelona Kathedral. At the Top Floor you have perfect view of the Kathedral. It´s not so far to Barcelona Centre, La Rambla, which is a big Avenue with lot´s of Restaurants and Shops. If you follow this Avenue against the Sea you are soon at the Harbour and the Beach, Barceloneta."
5569,"If you’re here to visit Chicago, this should not be a place for you to stay. You’re only forced to stay here when you have business in McCormick convention center. I had heard that the hotel had been renovated so was anxious to see how things had improved. If the rest of my work colleagues were not staying here, I’d pack up and go someplace else!!  The hotel just SMELLS- the rooms the hallways the lobby and it’s not pleasant. Walked into my sleeping room and was instantly disappointed. The mattress was extremely lumpy and the bed was barely made. The countertop on the desk was dirty and the chase lounge in the room -well I’m scared to sit on it. This is not inviting for leisure travel or business travel!  There are so many fabulous places in Chicago just skip this one. "
5570,"What a great find!  The staff at Hotel Eiffel Seine is the best.  Daniel (I hope this is the correct name) is one of the newer staff members and he was so helpful, friendly, and accomodating.  Thank you, Daniel.  The room was clean and comfortable.  The location couldn't be more convenient.  Be sure to walk up the street to check out the specialty shops for cheese, meat, seafood, and pastries.  The hotel breakfast was delicious.  A perfect variety.  Beulette, the hotel cat is super cute.  I highly recommend this hotel."
5571,"This is a terrible hotel. I am staying here for business meetings at the federal building next door. The hotel's proximity to the federal building is great. Everything else is bad. As other reviewers stated, the rooms are small. That wouldn't be a deal breaker if other attributes of the hotel were nice. However, there are a lot of problems. First, and most importantly, I do not feel safe in this hotel. The hallways are very dark and are full of little alcoves - plenty of places to get robbed or raped. Some of these alcoves have doors on them so an attacker could surprise a guest and trap a guest. The hotel has done nothing to address this situation. There are no cameras or lights anywhere to provide appropriate security. Second, the walls are paper thin and the individual room…"
5572,Incredible hotel with fantastic views and great staff!!Highly recommended.  Location was easy for people looking to be in amongst the best part of the city. Staff we were very friendly and very accommodating. Thank you! 
5573,A very nice and very clean but small Ibis hotel. The breakfast was minimal but we never left hungry The only drawback is this hotel sits on a very steep Hill so getting up to it is a bit of a challenge especially if you're pulling bags with you. The location is great. It is within walking distance to everything and very close to the main Liberdade Avenue. Lisbon is a great walking city.  You do not need a car for anything. 
5574,"This is an upmarket hostal with no en-suite facilities. The breakfast area is cramped and it is a help yourself service (food ok and plenty of tea, coffee, juices, fruit, yoghurts, cheese, ham, preserves & bread). We stayed in room number 1 for 3 nights which was very clean but there was no room for a wardrobe or a chest of drawers. The rooms and toilet/shower facilities (large and modern) were very clean. This place has it's attraction and we enjoyed staying here. The people were very friendly and helpful. The Guesthouse (hostal) was in the pleasant Rato area with good metro links to the airport. Metro from airport to Saldanha (Vermhela or red line) and change to Amarela or yellow line to Rato - convenient and cheap. Only a 20 mins walk into the centre of town. It was a nice…"
5576,"Our second visit, but first under Semsimar Management.  Everything acceptable, except there was confusion between the bar, and the restaurant. For example if we purchased a bottle of wine at the bar, it was necessary to purchase another bottle in the restaurant. This was a point of annoyance, as we permanently had two open bottles at any one time!"
5579,"We spent a lot of time in the hostel being harassed by a man named okay. I’m not sure if he is related to the hostel in some way? He was quite intimidating and drunk and when we were sitting having a drink he wouldn’t leave us alone, asking if we were going to sleep with him. He was also telling us that we were lazy and sponging off our fathers (based on nothing). If he is related to the hostel I’ll recommend that girls shouldn’t go there, and if he isn’t then stayokay need to storm this from happening! He was an opder, bald guy with a moustache"
5580,Well located - right next to Gare sant Lazare - very clean and comfortable. Very well priced given location. Rooms are compact but very nice. Very pleased with stay would remember if going back to Paris!! 
5581,"Room was nice looking enough, but so noisy it was near-impossible to sleep in. The room was almost comically loud, with kitchen sounds from the adjoining restaurant keeping us up until 2:30 and then up again at 6:00. Add that to neighbors slamming doors and footfall form the upstairs room, and the hotel was a complete ripoff. The front desk was sympathetic and offered earplugs, but they shouldn't be selling a room this loud. Worst hotel stay ever, and I have been in hundreds of hotel rooms."
5582,"Let me first say, that I didn’t have much time to research this last minute trip and needed more budget accommodations for our one night in Honolulu. I regret that deeply. First of all, I booked a room without an AC which was my fault for booking too quickly and the front desk staff was happy to accommodate if we needed AC. They did have 2 wall fans which we decided would be fine. I was prepared for “run down” and “budget” but not prepared for dirty and dingy. The place was just not clean. The trash cans in the hallway were overflowing. The pool was NOT what the pics looked like and appeared to have green algae/slime on the walls. The room towels were stained and two were just dirty. The sheets were thin and stained and the pillows were not much more than sleeping without one.…"
5583,"Stayed for 4 nights over new year with family. Location is great you can walk to anywhere or jump on the bus or underground. Rooms nice and clean, beds ok but pillows were way to soft, asked at reception and firmer ones sent up. No tea or coffee facilities in room but we knew this so took our own and travel kettle. Close to Christmas markets so was able to wander out and about every day. Pool and spa were nice,  one thing to note the sauna requires no bathing suits so just to prewarn if you have kids with you, nearly gave my daughter a shock!!! Overall lovely stay had by all."
5584,"I recently stayed here for 3 nights.  I was told at check-in that I would be charged $60/night for incidental fees.  After checking my bank account, I was charged $428.51 and another $60.00 in 2 separate transactions. 2 days later I was charged $266.58 and then on the 3rd day before I checked out I saw another $151.55 charge on my account.  My bill totaled $478.13.  All of the charges on my account totaled $906.64.  So an incidental fee that was supposed to be $180 ended up being $428.51, and an additional $248.51 (along with what was supposed to only be $180) of my hard earned money has been tied up for days.  I have called to speak with a manager and have gotten no response.  I will be reporting this business to the better business bureau.  This should never happen.  Not to…"
5585,"Following my enjoyable stay at the Upper House in Hong Kong, I was expecting a comparable experience at the Middle House (the latest edition to the Hotel Collective group which the Upper House is a member of).  Service aside (one should cut some slack for all new hotels as there is always teething problems), my stay was less than enjoyable and the new addition lacked the wow factor the Upper House had, even though the latter is an older property. In short, there are many hotel openings in Shanghai this summer, I wish I had done a little more homework before booking my stay here. A lesson learnt - a good sister hotel doesn't mean consistent standard across the board.  If you like the location of the Middle House, do stay at The Sukhothai which is located less than a 3 minute walk…"
5586,"Stayed four nights in April and walked everywhere!  Kevin at the front desk was very helpful and had good English.  Marwen in the breakfast area ran out to buy me chocolat au pain (chocolate filled croissants) when they ran out. The room was clean, limited English TV but, hey, we're in Paris!  Very nice having a small refrigerator to keep our picnic supplies cool. The location is very handy and safe."
5587,"Good hotel in a quiet area but better for business travellers with carry-on luggage than tourists. Spent three nights in the minimalist rooms with glass walled/shower area but the ""funky"" lightning is a designer's dream but a users nightmare. All overhead downlighters which means could not see to shave - or ladies to do make-up or hair.Woe betide anyone needing an early start. Not ideal.  Good for relaxing, hopeless for anything else. Minimal hanging space and no drawers for clothes makes living from a suitcase a nuisance or a challenge, depending upon the amount of luggage one has."
5588,"Poor swedish table for 20 euros per person  ,when people celebrate 100 years of Latvija-food was cold and not  like dinner !!!Looks more like business lunch .But bar -very good !Edgar barmen is very professional !!"
5589,"We came here 2 years ago and were determined to come back; it needs plenty of time to explore Paris. We had such a good time at this hotel we decided to come again. So glad we did; completely different staff but just as friendly and helpful as last time. It seems the hotel has some kind of secret supply of the nicest people in Paris......  The room was very romantic, relaxing, clean and comfortable; not huge and not much of a view but absolutely perfect for our needs. Good breakfast, plenty of choice with fresh quality ingredients, just right for the day ahead. A special mention for Yann who we had most of our dealings with, what a gem.... the perfect host.... (but I must say, everybody we met at the hotel were excellent) We’re looking forward to returning soon."
5590,"The girl that checked  E in could clearly give a damn. Everything I asked seemed problematic. When I asked about a room on the lakeshore I was told they were totally booked. A friend that came in 3 hours after me got a room upgrade to lakeshore side!! How does this happen!?!?   Had a problem getting a coffee pot and Microwave in my room!! Parking is a disaster!!!!! What the hell and I paying $1,000 for!!!! First time here I will never return!!!!!"
5592,"Recently returned from a 3 night stay at this hotel Check in was efficient and flawless We had a view of the river and main station which for me was great. The room was modern, clean and comfortable. We had breakfast at a cost of 15 euros each, dining area was modern and clean and offered plenty of choice for all tastes All the staff were very professional and happy to help with anything. The lounge area and toilets are modern and very chilled. If need be there is a room to store your luggage This is an ideal hotel if using the main train station, the area around is very safe and clean The taxi to Tegel Airport costs 20 euros and about a 15 minute journey You can walk, catch a bus or tram into the main shopping districts or to see the tourist attractions All in all I would…"
5593,"This Hotel is located very close to Downtown and the Historical Berlin. The Staff was very kind and always ready to help and orient to their guests. The public transportation is available all the time over the Otto-Braun-Strasse. We enjoy too much its excellent breakfast, cleanness and location. Top recommendation"
5594,"Booked this hotel due to the affordable price. The hotel itself was a bit run down broken blind(lady at the counter said they are waiting to fix) chipped toilet seat, crack on the wardrobe door(didnt stop us from using it). It felt like they had given up. On the positive notes the room was clean and hotel located 1min away from the metro and bus station. If you are looking for a no fuss just a bed to sleep on hotel this would do the job. "
5596,"Had a double Plaza room which overlooked the river, bridge and the Plaza.  The room was really good with the most amazing wallpaper.  Made us smile.  The location is perfect for exploring  with pleasant walks along the river and inland. Lots of interesting restaurants on the doorstep as well.  The staff were very attentive and a joy to speak with.  Only downfall was the breakfast which was chaotic. There were not hot plates for the hot food so consequently was cold and rubbery. not pleasant.!!  Waited an age for tea and the second cup took even longer.  Get this sorted and you would have a lovely hotel."
5597,"Not only is there no AC/fan in the rooms, the windows don’t even have screens so if you’re hot and want to open the windows you can’t or else you’ll have flies in your room. Other then that my smoke detector is literally wires coming out of the wall. I don’t know how this place is even in business"
5599,"My Wife and I decided to visit Paris at the end of a cruise, we were very unhappy with the hotel our travel agent booked for us. We went online and found the BW Kapital was a few blocks away. We went with no reservation and were greeted by a lovely Lady named Sophie, she went above and beyond to find us a room , even taking the time to show several to make sure we would be happy. The rooms were clean and decent size (for Paris), although Sophie was a real stand out helping us with directions and transit options, the rest of the staff were friendly and helpful as well. I would recommend this hotel to anybody planning a stay in Paris   "
5601,"I travel often for work, and this was easily the worst hotel experience in over a decade.  Let me describe this in detail:  I stayed at the Marriott Marquis for four nights during the recent RSA conference. Checked in and as a “gold elite” member am supposed to get a room upgrade. No dice. The room I received was small, old, dingy, and the bathroom tiles were covered in mold.  Want to work in your room? Sorry, this hotel has no room service; you have to go down to a bar which has been converted into a temporary “restaurant.” For breakfast in this restaurant, the only option is a buffet, at $34 plus tax, so $40 for toast, pastries, watery scrambled eggs, etc. Gee, why not eat all your meals here? I am sure a $30 pre made sandwich will be delicious.  The walls were so thin that I…"
5602,"I had 6 nights here and do not feel ""at home"" here, the reason is probably the slightly distinctive shape of the room .. also I can not stand the kind of bath they had here (you have to sit down to take a bath because the hose to direct the shower is too short).  The reception is ""cold"" - you feel that you are a inconvenience, If they learned to acknowledge your existence with a form of greeting - so one would feel a little more welcome - that would be nice.  Positive Here are neat and clean. There is a refrigerator. There are lockers.  Negative Miserable Internet. Bathing - you have to sit down and bathe.  Do not come here again if I can avoid it."
5603,"Spacious, clean rooms, internet is working, reception is only available 4pm to 8pm. Free parking and supermarkets nearby, all in all a less than fancy but very convenient option 20 minutes from the center of Berlin."
5604,Location was great but the room was in poor condition and bathroom was not in good working order. Shower was not draining properly and we had to take shower in intervals for it to drain first. Rooms felt dirty as the carpeting looks stained and dirty.
5605,"Spent 3 nights in this lovely hotel. It was the perfect base from which to explore Berlin. I loved that it's a modern, bright funky hotel in a fantastic location.  The staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel was spotlessly clean.  An added bonus was the food in the attached Asian restaurant and the amazing cocktails in the Room Room cocktail bar.  Would definitely recommend this hotel."
5606,The fan in my room was sooooo loud I could not sleep.  When I turned it off I froze.  I told this to the man at the desk and was not satisfied with his response.  The elevator was loud outside my room.  The light bulb was burnt out.  
5608,The hotel was closed for quite some time for refurbishment - The room we were in had the same furniture and fittings as they were in 1997 when we first visited. (It was the hotel Lagos in those days and we have stopped there nearly every year since) It was the worst room we have ever had - a flight of steps within the room and the TV only received Portuguese channels (Which I reported to no avail)
5609,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 night. We are a family of 4 with small kids and booked a family room. 2 separate sleeping areas and plenty of space. I would recommend this for a family. The only downside is that the windows are not very soundproof, and you can hear cars and people talking from the street ( We stayed on the 3rd floor ). The street is not busy but some people might bothered by that. The hotel is located right next to the Ramblas, and is within walking distance of many attractions. All together a nice hotel and location."
5610,"Rooms and bathrooms are very clean, a little bit small but comfortable. Wide and delicious breakfast. The staff is very kind. Car parking is available, also luggage storage is available after the check-out. The hall is very nice. The hotel is very close to Bellevue station. Everything was fine at Motel One."
5611,"Amazing location if you want to explore the city: even though tram and U-bahn stop on your doorstep we actually ended up walking most days (20 mins to Unter den Linden). Hotel was v accommodating and offered a choice of pillows, room is small but adequate. Only minor downfalls were the fact that they didn't refresh tea and coffee enough and didn't provide new glasses daily. PS if you do stay here I would advise you to take some amazing Ampelmännchen gummies from the lobby!"
5613,"Hi,  We stayed at the hotel last week for 4 nights. The check in experience was good. We were impressed with the hotel as soon as we entered. Our room on the 7th floor stank of damp, we were given different room, which was quick. Our TV was not working which was fixed instantly. Next day, remote stopped working, it was fixed but they had to keep the antenna box underneath the TV dangling as that was the only way to fix it. (It wasn't the technician's fault). first two days we had biscuits and chocolate box then it stopped. It is the 5 star hotel, this kind of service is expected as we pay for this.  On the last day, we realized the iron was not working but could not be bothered to call the reception as we were annoyed and fed up of complaining.    Apart form iron, we complained…"
5616,"It is very convenient for those arrived by train into Barcelona. It is just right opposite the Barcelona Sants Station. Exit from Mcdonald side, you will see it.  We stayed at 2 bedrooms apartment, it comes with a double bed + 2 single beds. The kitchen was well equipped, good for family travel with kids.  There are few restaurants at surrounding area.  In Barcelona, must try the Tapas (popular street food, served in small plate ) & Cava Sangria (a drink like cocktail). Very delicious with good price. Especially the restaurant next to the apartment (no need to walk across the street).  From Barcelona Sants station (Metro called it Sants Estacio), take Metro Line 3 (green col), you will reach Catalunya within 6 stops. Passeig De Gracia just another stop away. In fact, you can…"
5618,"On principle you shouldn't cross a picket line while workers are actively on strike. Logistically speaking, the hotel is currently unable to provide quality rooms and services due to the strike. There are plenty of other similar hotels in the area if your visiting soon. If not, don't spend your money here until the strike is over, you'll be happier for it."
5619,"Did not get housekeeping services after my first night. I asked the hotel why they missed my room. Their answer was ""I don't know"".  Wasn't too happy. No discount was offered. I paid full price for the room but didn't get full service."
5620,"Lovely clean hotel with a pool, steam room and sauna. Service was very good and the staff attentive. Lots of dining options nearby as well as grocery stores. Very central to exploring Paris. Hotel has breakfast facilities but no restaurant."
5621,"- No one speaks any language except Vietnamese: neither at reception, nor at restaurant. They bring in new people, but every new speaks worse and worse.   - at restaurant they charge 30 USD per person, food is cold like 3hrs old, no one explains how it works, no one to ask to show around, very poor service, people are bored, if asked - smile in the face and no, no solution whatsoever.  Useless scene with such quality of stuff. They are not prepared to host international guests!!! Never experienced such a zero understanding when communicating with hotel. I speak 5 languages and travel a lot, but I got angry since they just either don’t care to help even explain or just bored.  Unacceptable for USD 1375 for 7 days incl. breakfast. So far worst experience ever in Asia!"
5622,"Stayed at this hotel with family for two nights when travelling though central-Europe by car. There is a small garage on basement of the hotel, from where a lift is going directly to hotel floors, so it was surprisingly convenient with all of our luggage and our dog.   We arrived quite late. Our room had dog bowl and bed awaiting, which was nice. But was missing some towels, slippers and pillows for people, which was odd as our internet booking had included all necessary family info. Sloppy housekeeping, I would say. Night staff were helpful, as should be.   Pretty soon after arrival we noticed strange odor in our room. But were so tired that we just kept the windows open for a while, and fell asleep. In the morning the smell was clear; awful vomit stink, especially in the…"
5625,"I was happy upon check in to the hotel. Every moment seeing the executive rooms was exciting! But the “5 star” hotel have a few major problems ...firstly is the shared facilities ( GYM, indoor pool and sauna) with their residents in the same compound. I was shock with the how the resident handle the sauna facilities! A man with his son (around 3yrs old ) was having a fun time splashing buckets of   Water in-the sauna room. Wetting all the wooden benches and the electric heating generators. Creating a mess and a kind of “electric smell“ nearly causing a short circuit to the heating appliances and causing huge inconvenience of other hotel gusts from using the room bu the way the wooden benches in the saunas is also rotting and lack of maintenance what a disappointment!   Secondly…"
5626,"Excellent rooms, excellent restaurant and in easy walking distance of historic central Berlin. Staff were friendly and efficient. I’d want no more from a business hotel. If I had a gripe it would be the very ordinary courtyard view from the hotel."
5627,"Yours is probably the worst internet experience (Wi Fi) I hace ever had in my business trips. Trully very bad. The very few times I finally got online, the speed was so slow that I could do almost nothing even though I call the IT desktop almost everyday. I will surely change my hotel decision next time just because of this."
5628,"I was really not happy about our accomodations in this hotel. We stayed over the weekend. The hotel was completely empty, and the best room they conjourd up for us was far from our expectations. From the site, the luxury room seemed like a dream; in real life the long grey hallways that sink of cigarette ash and huge grey bedrooms with dirty carpets that triggered a dust mite allergy were far from what was shown on their website. The bathroom is decent, the bed is a king size, but not comfy. No comforter on the bed, just a sinthetic blanket. I will request a room change or else i check out 2 days early. I do not recommend this hotel for anyone with children or looking for comfort. Maybe its ok for a business trip, but I'd much rather stay at a decently priced Ibis than stay here…"
5629,"Great location 10 mins walk to Eifel tower. 5 mins walk to metro, safe neighborhood, very friendly staff, very clean and comfortable. i purchased breakfast in advance. Breakfast could be better but it was ok. I will definitely come back next time.   "
5630,"If you are planning a trip to the chicago area, think again about booking at the omni chicago.  While i know that all hotels have issues, it is how the hotel handles those issues with its guests that makes the difference.    We stayed last week at the omni from Tuesday - Saturday this past week.  We arrived around midnight on Tuesday evening and in the morning, there was no hot water in the bathroom.   I called the front desk at 7:15 am and they stated it was an individual room issue and someone would be sent up to look at it.  By 8:30 am, no one had arrived and we left the hotel at 8:30 unshowered because of our schedule.    It should be noted that maintenance was already in our room at 1:00 am, since the drain in the only sink in the bathroom was locked in the close position. …"
5631,"We stay here today, never been in such a noisy hotel. Check in took also forever, could not get a coffee at the bar at noon (not open yet) and no drink at 10 pm, already closed. There was also $ 19 added to the rate, and 13% tax and $ 30 for parking. If you still want to go, stupid, but ask for a room that is not connected."
5633,Stayed here one night and the valet service damaged my vehicle.  The hotel did not reimburse me.  No refund on the hotel stay.  If you're looking for a stress free stay I would find another hotel.  BRUTAL.
5634,"The Vila Lusitania is a small and friendly hotel, situated in a residential area of west Funchal above the Lido and the main hotel region of the town. We found the staff were very helpful and quite friendly.  Our room was quite small and the furnishings were old fashioned, but it was quite comfortable and was sufficient for our purposes.It was cleaned every day when we were out. There is no air-conditioning and we had to sleep with the window open, which led to some mosquito problems later in the week. The free wifi didn't extend as far as our room.  Breakfast, served on the terrace surrounded by flowers or in a small dining room, is a bit basic, with a choice of 4 or 5 menu's (no open buffet!). Mrs Woodpecker was disappointed, but I found it adequate (mind you, I did pinch half…"
5635,"It was unusually hot while we were in Paris, so we had to vacate our Latin Quarter apartment without air-conditioning and move here.  Boy were we pleased!  It was such an upgrade!  This was the only hotel that we stayed at in all of France that had strong/forceful AC.  The rooms were expectedly small for Paris, though immaculate and well-appointed.  The furnishings were new and modern.  The front desk staff were wonderfully helpful and spoke English and four other languages fluently.  We were sad to be further outside the city, but we actually loved the location.  It was in a quiet residential neighborhood where you could walk to everything and have a really authentic Parisian experience.  Really good restaurants/patisseries in this area.  Two-minute walk to the Metro station. …"
5636,"I stay at this hotel November 17-2017 -November 19,2017.  After i check out my card was charged for items i did not use such Breakfast and Car Parking and i did not even had a car.  I call the hotel and explain the issued and no one could assist me."
5637,"From 25 Sept-8 September was our Vacation.  The following are the customer ratings given based on a 1-5 rating, 5 being the best and 1 being the worst:  * Room - Dead animal found I.e Gecko in a Trap that was at least 4 days old after checking in. - Rating 3 * Housekeeping Cleanliness - Rating 5 * Food - Breakfast no fried eggs. Rating = 4 - Buffet = Noodles were tough and hamburger for the the Cantaloni was dry. Rating 3 Serving of menus for the starter took 45 minute. - Rating 3 Total time for all three courses approx. 1 hour 20 minutes. Rating 2 * Service friendliness / Administrative - Rating = 5  Overall Hotel Rating =3,5 and not a 4 star service!  "
5638,"This hotel is not worthy of the JW brand. Room sizes are miniature versions of a real hotels, minibars are just like cheap motels - electronically monitored - (whilst you lay 3x for the room price tag vs more welcoming options in town) staff is quick to harshly frown upon you for asking for anything. Ripoff is more like the word I think of. Never ever stay in this hotel unless you want to burn cash. "
5639,"Visited Funchal for the Xmas lights and market  which were very  good. Our room was clean but Ifound  the beds were hard and were uncomfortable  unless you were lying on top of the duvet. We paid extra for a sea view however  there is a  busy road in front of the hotel with a lot of traffic noise  .We stayed bed and breakfast  and  although there was enough choice  of food  there was limitations to the variety , whether this was due to being low season or perhaps my expectations from  previous stays in other 4 star hotels . Drinks were reasonably priced  and the pool and garden areas were always clean  but appeared to have a couple of resident stray cats.  Good value for money if you  don't upgrade to a sea view room  and want  a pre Xmas holiday"
5640,"Location of the hotel is very good - just off the Ramblas street which means it is not very noisy, literally 2-3 min walk to Liceu metro station. The staff was extremely polite and welcoming. It took us a while to figure out how the showers works as it was either too hot or too cold, so it takes a while to get a gist of it, but overall we did enjoy our stay and recommend this hotel if you want to stay in close proximity to a bustling life near Gotico and Ramblas."
5641,"Only bad experience i had in vietnam, mostly due to the (male) staff who were rude to every question asked. Fine facilities but didn't enjoy staying here. Food is overpriced and small at the bar, better off eating elsewhere."
5642,"I found this recently refurbished hotel on Trip Advisor and have spent a very pleasant 3 days in Paris staying at Hotel International. The hotel has recently been refurbished and was decorated to a high specification and spotlessly clean. The room I stayed in on the 6th floor was a lot bigger than I had experienced in similar sized Paris Hotels with a really good sized double bed The breakfast is very good and staff extremely friendly. All this was good but I also liked the location a five minute walk to Place de la République but not a main road so it was quiet and relaxed, all in all a little gem"
5643,"Where do I begin with this review? I was utterly disappointed.   First of all when we arrived we were not given help to get to our room. They just gave us our room cards and told us where the elevators were. But it's fine, all well. We got inside our room with no problems, right? WRONG! None of the three cards could open the door. We tried and tried and tried until the door finally recognised our cards. Neither one of the recepsionist could open our door when he came to check a problem we had. We struggled with that door every single day. We had to go down to the reception to check our cards and still the same problem over and over.   The room wasn't ready when we first entered. Our extra bed came afterwards and it was thrown inside like ""Here it is. Do whatever you wanna do…"
5644,The best hotel in whole Montparnasse area. Very lively street full of bars and eat out places. Yet the hotel is very quite and the ambience is cosy. The breakfast though could be better. The personnel is nice.
5646,"I have stayed in both their basic suite and then upgraded to their next room-type during ITB Berlin. I am still not sure if the extra money was worth the upgrade as the smaller sized room type was just as quaint and had the perfect lay out (bedroom/bathroom lay out). The rooms were super clean. Housekeeping did a phenomenal job. The location was great. In a quiet neighborhood with great local restaurants in the area. In fact Schwartz's cafe suggested by a Receptionist was a phenomenal choice.   Breakfast was also amazing, however I was let down when breakfast staff told me on my 4th night (out of a 5 night stay) that items off an a la carte menu during breakfast were also included in my room rate.   The only poor thing I can say about the property is that there was a general…"
5647,Hotel located 15 minutes from downtown shopping area. The problem we encountered was elevator service. Watching time could be 15 minutes. Service was spotty at times front desk took forever to check in. Room are spacious bathroom had two sinks shower was good. Buffett breakfast was just ok. Eggs watery pancakes cold. I give this 3 stars for that reason. 
5648,"There was a giant wet spot in the middle of my carpet... it just kept expanding... couldn't figure out where it was coming from. Had to wait forever to be checked in, front desk staff was completely disorganized.  Blackout curtains were sticky, like they hadn't been cleaned in years.  I had to wash my hands to get the sticky jam like substance off of my hands after closing my windows for the evening.  I travel almost weekly for business.  This place was gross!"
5649,"The location of the hotel is fine, as there are many public transports (bus and metro) in walking distance (2-5 minutes). Rooms are clean, not too small, but you can hear all noises outside the room, incl. traffic noise. Breakfast was every day the same (except fruits), but ok and enough. Fresh juices, coffee machine, several bread, etc. Employees are nice and helpful. Price for a double room incl. breakfast about 400,- Euro for 5 nights, this is really ok."
5650,"My husband and I stayed at Novotel Mitte, Berlin in August 2019 with our young teenage daughter. The staff at this hotel were super friendly and helpful!  The breakfast buffet was amazing, albeit pricey! The restaurant for dinner was also very good. Not really any other restaurants close by.  The room was nicely made up for us when we arrived with the pullout couch made up for our daughter, much appreciated!  Cleanliness was only average. Fingerprints all over the windows, corners not vacuumed, and etc  Plenty of clean towels provided daily.   A little noisy with it being located on one of the major thoroughfares for emergency vehicles. At first we thought there was a major disaster going down  with all the sirens until we were informed of this fact!!  It was quite close to walk…"
5651,"We stayed here for four nights during August. Great base for exploring Berlin, not right in the centre but very close to the underground and bus stops so very easy to navigate your way around. Lots of good bars and restaurants nearby too.  We stayed in a comfort room which was stylishly appointed with lots of nice features. Bed was very comfortable. The only thing that stopped us giving it 5 stars was that there was no air conditioning - on our first night the weather was really hot which meant that the room was very warm - not necessarily the hotel’s fault as I know Berlin has been having some very hot weather of late, but just an observation.  There is a breakfast restaurant downstairs called Benedict which we ate in twice - food was very good but it does tend to get very busy…"
5652,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Hotel Carlton last weekend, and we had a bad experience. First, the hotel had not received the reservation we had made 3 days earlier on HotelTonight, and we had to wait 45 minutes in the lobby. When we finally got our room, we realized that we could hear every word people next room were saying. Needless to say we did not sleep at all during the night! When we complained to the front desk at check out, we were told that the manager would contact us. After waiting a couple days, I ended up calling the hotel and leaving a message on the manager's voicemail. To this day, I have not heard back.. In any case, do NOT stay at this hotel if you're trying to sleep at night!!"
5653,"The hotel is not bad by itself, but let’s face it: is not a Jumeirah. Now is a normal 5 star hotel in China that can be branded anyway (even local brand).   Stayed here 4 years ago and it was a blast to stay at Jumeirah Himalayas, really it was such a great opportunity to stay at this place. Everything was high class, refined, ultra luxury... but now all changed.  Maybe because of the location and lack of enough customers, the hotel changed its strategy and now is more focused on local market and lost its charm completely. Service and luxury went downhill:  - Run down accommodations, everything feels dated and old at rooms. - You cannot control the A/C, temperature is centralized. In a 5 stars hotel, I expect to sleep at the temperature I want. - Once great, the fitness center…"
5654,"Nice hotel in Berlin Mitte, central located. Very friendly staff at the reception and breakfast. Interior is modern with a lot of great Art.  Nice restaurants in the neighbourhood. Sightsseeings in walking distance. Close to public transport."
5656,"If you’re looking for a clean bed to sleep in, you can get it here, but not much else.  The beds are not firm.  You sink about 1 foot when you sit on the bed. Rooms are small.  Long narrow work area with the most uncomfortable chair I’ve ever sat on.  No heat on chilly nights.   There is only one English TV Channel.  The shower is extremely slippery.  So slippery, I had to sit in the stall to wash my legs & feet.  Since there was nothing to hold on to, lifting one leg to wash will mean disaster.  Two stiff bath towels, and no hot water in the sink.  Shaving in cold water was an experience.  Toilets are low flow, so plan on spending most of your time in the bathroom, flushing.  8 flushes should do it.  Breakfast is fairly nice, but is not free.  ($12.00 BRL).   Internet…"
5657,"This was the perfect European boutique hotel.  Our family of four had plenty of room, which is often hard to find overseas for a reasonable price.  The location was wonderful - within walking distance to all the sights we wanted to see, and in a safe area.  We took walks at night with our any hesitation.  The staff was helpful and friendly.  We decided not to eat breakfast at the hotel as the price seemed a bit expensive , but there were cafes and bakeries right around the corner which were perfect.  The beds were comfortable, wi-fi was reliable, and it was very quiet.  I would absolutely stay here again!"
5658,"After booking through TripAdvisors third party, cancelon, I received a confirmation for my room. After a great night out for my moms 60th Bday we went to go check in and the young lady at the front desk kept telling me she does not have a reservation for me. I asked to speak to a manager and with attitude she replied “I am the manager”. Her service and attitude was so horrible that she even realized it and apologized at the end when we didn’t receive a room and even said no worries I’ll review your hotel soon. While I was working through trying to get the room i reserved, my mom was being kicked out by security for opening the door to a man who stepped outside the side door to smoke. Since the security gaurd didn’t see him go out and only caught my mom being nice by letting the…"
5659,"The lobby bar has a consistent odor like sour milk. The wait staff seem out of sync and slow. Wouldn't stay here based on earlier issues, but have to go occasionally to attend industry outings. I can't be the only one who smells that stench. Ugh!"
5660,"Stayed for 3 nights in the last week in March. The hotel is in a very good location for access to most of the main attractions (museums, canal trips etc) which are within a reasonable walking distance. Rembrandt Square itself, where there are a good selection of bars, cafes, restaurants and coffee shops, is less than 100 yards away. Our room was on the 4th floor overlooking the street. It was rather dark but comfortable - and we knew about the frosted glass bathroom door before we booked (not a showstopper)! It was noisy, especially when the refrigerated lorries arrived and parked up out front around dawn and folk left the night club (situated further down the street) in the early hours.     Staff were courteous, helpful and generally cheerful.   Housekeeping was a bit ""hit and…"
5662,We stayed at Tupa Hotel at the end of January 2019.  The second night something was biting me several times.  Turned on the light to find the bed full of ants.  Talked to  the manager the next morning and he agreed to give us a partial credit.  It has been two months and no credit.  Have emailed the hotel two times and no response.
5663,"Too all buddies,  As we know, inside the movie 007, skyfall, le royal was selected by the film director so that is one of my main reason to select here.  Nevertheless, I was quite disappointed about the arrangement and service they provided.  Firstly, i booked a room for 3 ppl, then they accepted and added me a bed at my room; but they only gave me 2 ppl breakfast and I did pay three ppl price. The most important is that the hotel staff said this is okay for 3 ppl to enjoy the breakfast.  Secondly, the water boiler and one of my hotel cards also doesn't work.  I knew that is not a big deal man, but I think the hotel staff should check before let hotel guests who enter the room and use the service and equipment. By the way, the staff didn't help me to solve the problem that the…"
5664,"Spent 2 nights here. As its in the centre of Berlin you're overlooked by office blocks. Room was adequate with tv/tea & coffee making facilities. Breakfast was a fabulous buffet with exceptional choice from full English to fruit to sparkling wine! Although I never saw anyone drinking it. We avoided dinner and ate among the numerous cafes and restaurants. A tip, next door to the hotel is a beer keller that does good beer and food. One thing that worried us was the lack of emergency exit signs. We never did find the stairs. For security reasons your key card also operates the lift. Was not comfortable with this in an emergency."
5665,"Service is a Marriott standard world wide.   This hotel fails to meet the standard.  It failed the basic tests of welcoming, responsive, and politeness.   The lobby and your path to our room are a maze.  Don't expect room service , they don't believe in it.  Don't expect a quiet late night drink, you won't get a quiet one.  Don't expect a friendly breakfast, it doesn't exist.    This year I have spent 4.5 weeks in Hotels . All of the except 3 nights we're at Marriott's.   Bare none, this is the worst Marriott I have been in.  "
5666,"I did not get a chance to stay at the hotel.   We booked our trip on 6/22/15 on booking.com and cancelled 6/24/15, for a stay July 10-12.  We were immediately charged the full cost of the stay,  but have yet to get any refund.   Also,  please note the hotel has a cancellation fee of at least one nights stay no matter how soon you cancel.   Booking.com did not clearly display this.   I've contacted both booking.com and the hotel to dispute the 1 nights charge and have not yet had any resolution or credit back to our account (even for the amount above the cancellation fee).   So my warning is be extra cautious of your rates and sure of your plans before giving them your credit card information."
5667,"Perfect place to visit all the attractions due to her perfect location close to the metrostations. Friendly hotel. Smal but clean room. Good beds. Good breakfast, only the coffee machine should be replaced."
5669,"We stayed there for 2 nights through New Year 2017. As good points go, it has a really nice clean beach and nice clean pool. Other than that, the decor was outdated hence it made the room look a bit untidy. We had dinner there the 1st night and the food was way below average to say the least. Food was served lukewarm. My fish and sour soup was cold by the time I came back for the 2nd helping. My husband's food wasnt any better. All in all, it was a very bad experience, and for the price we paid, it was very overpriced! And we didnt order any special seafood at all. We paid a fraction of the price taking a taxi to restaurant in Nguyen Dinh Chieu Street.  Having that experience with food, we didnt expect much from the buffet in the morning. The buffet wasnt good at all. And so was…"
5670,"It's my first and last time staying at this hotel. I had some expectations for the hotel before checking in since it was an Intercontinenal and they had a four star diamond at the check-in. We got in at 11:30 pm after a long flight and at check-in, they made us wait to check-in because the two receptionists were busy chit-chatting. Upon going to the room with my key, I tried the key ten times and I still couldn't get in the room. After heading back to the front desk, they told me they were not used to the new system. Hmm... or was this just them chit-chatting and didn't pay attention? Inside the room, they have no complimentary water and is forcing guests to pay USD7 to drink their over priced Evian water. I called room service to inquire about is and they sounded lazy and dead.…"
5671,"My family and I were very displeased with our stay here. When our flight was delayed 24 hours, we called to inquire about our hotel reservation and we were told, by Diego, that we couldn't get a refund for that night but that we could check in early the next morning. But when we got to the hotel, we were told that one of our rooms was not ready. Since our arrival was anticipated 24 hours before we actually arrived, there was no excuse. They must have allowed others to stay in the room. However, they still refused to refund us for that night. Then, one of our rooms had air conditioning problems so bad that even after multiple calls and visits from people who claimed to fix it, two from our party required a room change. Even with the room change, another call was required to make…"
5672,Great location! Parking can be problematic but otherwise the location is fantastic. You're in the centre of everything. The staff are very helpful. The rooms are nicely decorated but not very big. There are two restaurants on the ground floor - one Italian and Portuguese. The food is good too. Worth a stay. 
5674,"The interior design is very nice, but it is not really practical. The so called ""apartment"" is a room with a bathroom and a kitchenette covered by a folding door which was very bothering to be honest and not practical at all. If it was open it took a lot of space from the room, same for the closets. I guess the images online are a bit confusing and the room there seems bigger than what you actually get. Also, it was very dark, as the room had only a small window located very high, so no view, very disappointing. We've stayed quite a few days, for such a budget I would expect to get new towels... but no.   The bed was very big and comfy!  The staff was very nice and helpful. The location was good. Overall I wouldn't recommend this place as it is too expensive for what it offers."
5675,"I am a retired travel agent who has seen the world & stayed in 100s of hotels. This is one of the worst! VERY Rude front desk people, dirty hallways, rooms. Parking next door is $35, not $45 as front desk will tell you."
5676,"Okaaaaay, I am tired, and not in the best mood . It's my second trip to Chicago, this time stayed at Hyatt Centric Chicago Magnificent Mile, 4 stars, friendly staff. But! I booked the room for three persons, we had 2 duvets for 3 people, 1 bathrobe for 3 people, 1 pair of slippers for 3 people, 2 pairs of ear plugs for 3 people, 2 glasses for 3 people. Asked for additional essentials, we received duvet without cover. And now we have 2 bathrobes for 3 people! Looks like I should SHARE the bathrobe with my brother or with my mom.  What else... Oh, I forgot! It's 00.33 a.m., I really want to sleep. We set thermostat to cool the room down to 65 degrees Fahrenheit, but temperature raised up to 80, and still continue raising, called reception, they offered us a fan. FAN! How they…"
5677,"Having seen the previous reviews of this hotel, I was quite optimistic about staying there. I stayed there for 6 nights, and became less and less impressed with it for each day. I found the reception to be quite rude, but was nevertheless quite pleased with the quality of the room. Tidy and comfortable bed. However the bathroom is terrible. The toilet is crammed against the wall so that doesn't leave much room. The hotel is far too expensive for what it delivers, so I would not recommend it. And if you are not too known in Rio, then be aware that over half of the taxi drivers I used had never heard of the place."
5678,"As stated, this is a nice hotel in a great neighorhood, however on the last day we had a run-in with their manager over a completely absurd hotel policy about for which they had zero flexibility nor compassion for our feelings.  On top of that, I've been trying to get in touch with them for two weeks in regard to the incident with zero response.  On the last day of an otherwise splendid vacation the hotel manager Miguel informed us that per hotel rules he would was charging us for a new set of sheets and a towel.  This was due to some stains caused two nights earlier while my wife was asleep and began her menstrual cycle.  You can imagine wife's humiliation at the thought of strangers discussing her menses.  If we had been jumping on the bed with muddy shoes it would have been…"
5679,"Even though the hotel is located 20 -30 minutes walk from some of the major sights, it has some restaurants, bakeries & small grocery stores nearby.  The place is clean and the staffs are very helpful.  Specially mentioned the gentleman at the front desk Pablo at the front desk helped me to print the boarding passes when the public printer was not working and I was operating with my ipad to send him the information.  He was very patient and friendly."
5680,"The bathroom is old and needs renovation, no amenities in the bathroom. The pillows are very bad. No A/C in the reception and corridors. Carpeting is all old and worn out. The furniture both in the room and public areas are old dirty and worn out. The food at breakfast is dull and not suitable for vegetarians or vegans."
5681,"I checked in thru the maze of elevator switching; found a beer, half eaten salad and brownie in my room fridge; reported it; was told it would be cleaned out the next day; and, of course, it was not and had, by then, acquired a rather pungent odor.  I was given nothing but a combination of platitudes and interruptions on the insincere calls to apologize for a room that was now stinky with left over food!"
5682,"We were in Porto just before Easter and didn't book our hostel in time so this one was the last one that had rooms available. For the Easter weekend they raised the prices so it was a lot more expensive than any other hostel we've stayed at in Portugal. The staff is really nice, breakfast is good and the beds are very very comfortable with curtains so you don't even see others coming home late at night. However the atmosphere isn't very ""hostel-like"" but it feels rather like being in a hotel. Also the bathrooms were not always clean and the food leftovers one of our roommates left in the room were not removed by the cleaning staff for like 3 days.   Conclusion: I'm not sure if the hostel is worth the higher prices but it's probably not the worst option."
5683,"We stayed here for one night, the guesthouse was full and we were given a room just outside the walls. Location was fine and we were able to park our car right outside the room. Only a short walk into the town.  The accommodation was dated and the bathroom very small and cramped. We felt it was not good value for money but it was clean and adequate. "
5684,First of all I would say that I waa disappointed in the hotel.  Finding the entrance was difficult to get to and the area was small.  The room was smaller than expected with the bathroom large but only a stand up shower.  Then balcony was very small and cramped. Our room was noisy as the neighbors sounded like they were moving furniture every time were went to bed.  I didn't use the pool or Jacuzzi facilities but did have lunch and dinner at the restaurant and also purchased beverages and breakfast items from the Starbucks (which really is limited in the offering).Prices are high(to be expected at a hotel in Waikiki ) but the portions and quality not up to my standards.   I was  there for a conference/seminar and believe that I should have received a discount on the parking as…
5685,"This hotel is in a fabulous location making everything easy to get to. The welcome at reception was warm. The room was disappointing, I love soft lighting but this is too dark. The shower leaks so much that all towels are required to ensure the room isn't flooded. For a 4 star there isn't a shower cap, tissues or decent tea or coffee (just sachets). Did not smell fresh but stale. Breakfast was excellent.  There was a welcome drink which would have been better called a red/white wine as any other request e.g. Port is not available. A little embarrassing. "
5686,Hotel de rome is the right place to have relaxed days in Berlin.  Hotel de rome as starting Point for sight seeing is perfectly. the Hotel is for Business Events a high Level Frame  and i believe Hotel de rome located on a nice place shows international guests the best side of  germans capital city
5687,"My husband and I stayed at the Sofitel Lisbon for 7 nights at the end of July. We stay an Sofitels quite often. We like the level of service, comfort and expertise of the staff. They make you feel ""special"". This Sofitel was below that level. Just because there is a 2nd turn down, does not mean the hotel is high service. There was just a lack of knowledge of high end service from the cleaning of the room (things always missed) to the waitstaff giggling in groups in the dining room. We did hate that they let loiterers smoke at the entrance and the doorman was rarely on site. Seemed like a new business with a poorly trained staff. That being said, nothing was terrible and our stay was fine. The location was good. The rooms were nice and the building itself was very nice.  We…"
5688,"My boyfriend and I stayed here while visiting my sister, and it was perfect! We had easy access to a large U-Bahn station (Wittenbergplatz) and multiple bus lines. There were plenty of quality restaurants near by with affordable prices. It was also a calm neighborhood at night, so we never had trouble sleeping.  The room was small, but perfect for two people. There is no refrigerator, but we didn't really need one anyway.  The hotel bar had a very cool, relaxed vibe. There were plenty of comfy seats and beers were reasonably priced. The bartenders also made great mixed drinks (I love a good Mojito!).  I will definitely recommend Motel One to others, especially the Tiergarten location. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
5689,I hate to write a negative review. I can't really say there is anything wrong with this resort but it was a disappointment nonetheless. It lacks the charm and beauty of other resorts and hotels we stayed in during our visit to Portugal. It was a good base for visiting the Obidos region of Portugal but there was nothing about the resort itself that made us want to hang out there.
5690,A basic hotel but clean. Staff are very friendly which made our holiday. They work really hard. I wouldnt rate it a 4 star but then again you only get what you pay for. Motorway runs above at the back of hotel but there isnt any noise from it. It is a good base and very quiet with just a few bars and no beach.
5691,"When I booked this hotel I was expecting to walk into a somewhat big room with a decent view, instead when I walked in it was the complete opposite. The service was terrible and the pictures online are nowhere near accurate to what is depicted in real life. Aside from all this, the elevator was broken and the hotel was surrounded by homeless people. I walked outside in the morning and there was a homeless lady peeing right outside. What was really disappointing was the fact that I was with my two kids and the hotel doesn't even have its own restaurant or anything. I texted the phone number given to me in case I needed towels or anything else, but no response. That only gave off the impression that the workers there are completely irresponsible. What upset me the most was the…"
5692,"Wonderful service, warm, friendly staff, beautifully appointed rooms, restaurant and bar - will definitely be back. Try the waffles with fresh honeycomb at breakfast, and the local Berliner gin at the bar. Thanks for a perfect home base to explore Berlin from!"
5693,"Horrible experience, we will never be back.  We came to the Hotel on Saturday, November 18th so that we could spend the day in downtown Chicago and then attend the parade.  When we arrived at 2:30 pm we were told our room wasn't ready yet so we had to wait.  After waiting 30 minutes we asked roughly how much longer and at that point we were told it would be about another HOUR because the guest in the room had a late checkout.  At this point the lobby was full of people, we had our luggage, and our two little ones were not so happy about waiting and I can't blame them because neither was my wife or I.  After expressing my frustration they put us in a temporary room just so we were off the floor and out of the lobby with the kids.  Then after our actual room, the one we had a…"
5695,"We stayed in this hotel for one night when we missed our connecting flight home.  The staff was not friendly or helpful.  The first room we were given smelled like a smoking lounge even though it was supposed to be a non-smoking floor.  When I asked the reception for another room, the person at the desk didn't even apologize.  She just gave me the key to another room which also smelled faintly of smoke but was better than the first one.  The restaurant and breakfast were over-priced.  Maybe the management feels they don't have to try very hard because it is an airport hotel.  If you have a choice, do not stay here."
5696,"Dingy dark depressing hotel with small beds (double not queen) and basics not provided in rooms, e.g. tea, coffee, mugs, Tv remote batteries, wifi - although you can ask for these and pay for wifi. Glass panels to bathroom means its not sound or light proof for families, and glass door to bathroom bangs which is annoying. We just wanted to go home a day early as our room was depressing and bad sleep. Pool towels and water and apples a nice touch.Linen and pillows lovely, good TV. Internet in business centre too slow to use."
5698,"We stayed here for 3 nights this weekend for our anniversary and it was awful. The hotel is shabby, outdated and just feels unclean. The room was small and had old dirty looking carpets, old curtains, and peeling paint on the ceilings, and it was small with no counter space in the room or bathroom, and only one bed side table, and no heating or a/c.   We arrived late and asked if there was room service or anything and were just told no. So we had to go out and try to find a nearby store just to get some bottled water at midnight, we then arrived in our cold room to find no heating, after which we were told we would have to go to reception to get a space heater. The service was awful.  However, the worst part of all was ththe bed bugs!  After the 2nd night we noticed we had bites…"
5700,"My family (me, my wife and adult son) decided to stay here to celebrate the New Year and visit families here in Shanghai as I had a good stay with Hyatt on the Bund a few years back. We had a good midnight NYE party crossed the river. We went out for brunch with local families on the New Year’s Day. We came back to our room at 3 pm but the room was still not cleaned. We had two local friends to our room at 5:30 pm for a brief visit before we had out for dinner at 6:30 pm. Just as our friends showed up, the cleaning crew showed up. We tried to accommodate her and decided to move our conversation to the bar upstairs.   What happened next was unbelievable! We came to the bar entrance and the manager stopped us and told us only 3 of us are allowed to go into the bar. But my friends…"
5701,"I booked 2 rooms for 2 nights in Sept 2017 and prepaid using credit card points.  The hotel was gross.  It was in a section of town crawling with street hustlers.  Some people coming and going into and out of the Opal looked like hookers.  The room was disgusting.  What's even worse is that they had to shut the water off at night due to renovations.  That was the last straw.  I gave the hotel management 24 hours notice that we were not going to stay the 2nd night.  I found a much nicer hotel for about the same price near Union Sq.  When I tried to get my points ($) back for the second night (since we did not stay at the Opal the second night), the Opal refused to refund the points.  Chase Visa could not do anything about that so I ended up paying for the 2 rooms at the Opal that…"
5702,"Near the marvellous / beautiful beach, quiet et peaceful place with swimming pool. A little cheap market just next door 😉 Nice place for a stay in family even with friends. Not luxurious but all modern conveniences are there. Terrace is the must!"
5703,"Absolute lovely Hotel. From Check In to Check Out we were very well looked after. The breakfast was fantastic, the rooms extremely lovely decorated and comfortable bed. Location wise it couldn’t have been any better, especially for the transport connection to the airport! We definitely come back! Merci 25h for the wonderful time."
5704,"This is ridiculous. I expect as an honors member to have clear pricing prior to my stay. An additional $90 hold on my card for each day was not made clear on the Hilton Honors website where I booked.  Awesome. Then to find the previous guest left their bbq meat in the room.  Then the next morning there’s no coffee, not enough cups for the 3 people who were on the rooms reservation. We call for coffee, they tell us we need to come get it. We go to get it. They tell us they don’t have it. We wait. We call again. Oh finally they send coffee. Gross.  "
5705,"What a nightmare!! I arrived as scheduled at 11:30 pm to be advised that the hotel had overbooked and there were no available rooms.  Six other guests arrived at the same time to receive the same greeting. No phone calls, no emails, no advance notice!  The hotel advised the nearest available room was at the Marriott O'Hare.  If you are traveling on business and need a hotel room you can count on stay somewhere else!!"
5706,"On arrival a very impressive hotel beautifully appointed with marble flooring throughout. Helpful young staff polite in manner and aim to provide good service. We booked a delux room which again was very nicely appointed, large bathroom, amazing bed which was a highlight. So so comfortable. The main dining room is currently being renovated so breakfast was delivered in a nearby function room area. I’m sorry to say that the breakfast was a little disappointing for a five star hotel. A massive plus for the Regent is it’s location literally minuets from the main sights in Mitte.  "
5707,"We are staying for two nights leaving tomorrow as part of a tour. The hotel is very nicely decorated and the perfect location. Unfortunately out bathroom stank of cigarettes and when we opened the window the first night we saw that someone had got sick out it and it was splashed on the window. The next day housekeeping cleaned the room but this was not rectified.  We had cocktails at the bar this evening. The server was less than polite, at one point sighing loudly. When we asked to sign the docket to place the drinks on the room bill he questioned my husband on his full name and made us wait while he checked on the computer to make sure we weren't scamming them, it was embarrassing.   "
5708,We arrived just befor midnight due to a delayed flight. All in-house eateries close at midnight and no room service after midnight. We were guided to a couple of late night cafes/kebab shops a short walk away. Had to insist on a room with a double bed (as per our original request) - rooms are antiquated and air-condition system is wholly inadequate.
5709,"Negatives: Building work - unsightly, noisy - which the notice to guests said would be limited to between 9am and 6pm - but wasn't! Hotel staff rude and unhelpful - they seem to be worn down by the many complaints from guests. The shuttle to Funchal only runs twice per day (not 3 as stated on website). The pool was out of use for 2 days of our stay while the flooring was being replaced. The room we were allocated as a superior room with balcony had a tiny balcony which would only accommodate two chairs and overlooked the tyre and calor gas shop. As the hotel was far from full, I asked if we could be moved and was told by the receptionist 'you've got what you paid for'.  Such unnecessary rudeness as another member of staff did allocate us a different room with a sea view and a…"
5710,Really good hotel right in the centre of where you want to be. Staff are kind and helpful well dressed and couldn’t help enough.  Trying to book to keep staying there.  Clean sheets and they even let me sleep into 12.45 when I overslept because of how good the bed was.  Didn’t want to give a review as I will never get a good price again but gave my word I wanted to write a review.
5712,"Let me start by saying that this hotel is not downtown. It is a 20-30 tram ride in to downtown. It is very close to the airport though (2nd train stop). It is across the street from the Amsterdam RAI convention center.   To catch a tram downtown, you can go out the front of the hotel, turn right, go down about 1 block and cross at the crosswalk. The tram stop is in the middle of the street. The number 4 tram runs to downtown and back. If your facing the convention center (so hotel is behind you) take the tram that's running left to right. This is heading to downtown (the other way will eventually eat there though too, just take longer to get to end of line and come back).   You can also catch a train downtown at the RAI station. The tram number 4 can be caught here too. To get…"
5713,"Location was really good. The hotel looks nice with a beautiful park behind it. However, it was very expensive (not worth the price). I have had better (and cheaper) stay in other other hotels in Amsterdam. Room was very small, the minibar (minifridge) did not work (it did not keep any of our stuff cool), we were on the top floor with a very small window in our room, bed as way too soft and I had back pain the next day. "
5714,"Third time stay at Lindemann's. As recently as a year ago we thought it was very well appointed, but has just undergone major refurbishment to keep it absolutely top notch. The reception, bar, lounge and breakfast areas heve been the major targets and are absolutely excellent. We had a ""comfort"" room and found it again to be clean, comfortable, spacious and unfussy. Recent additions are a fridge / minibar and safe. Cost remains highly competitive for a hotel with such ready access to attractions (and airport). Breakfast is tremendous and worth the extra if not in your package. Staff are friendly and efficient, for example knowing we had stayed before. Breakfast staff quickly sized up preferences, knowing from Day 2 that we preferred coffee and thereafter did not need to ask; it…"
5715,"Stayed here with family in early April. The hotel is basic but very clean and very quiet. The staff all speak excellent English and were very friendly and helpful with any small issues we had, for instance, with extra bedding. Breakfast was very filling but pricey. There is a nice park immediately adjacent to the hotel with a playground for younger kids, loads of coffee shops and restaurants in the area so you won't be stuck for somewhere to eat and very well connected to public transport. The U-Ban stop is less than 200 metres from the hotel and there is a bus stop (across from the Woolworths) which will take you direct to the K-Damm, Berlin Zoo etc in about 20 minutes. Bus number is M46, if I remember correctly. I would highly recommend it as an economical option. Not luxury…"
5716,"  best location, near to two metro stations , clean and nice rooms,comfortable and clean toilet room , good breakfest,  nice staff, the hotel is located in a silent street  near testurants and supermarkets "
5717,"Wonderful apartments in Mitte, in a very good position. The apartment was very clean and has been cleaned every day, there was a nice swimming pool which has been very appreciated by my children.  Bus stops and undergroun stop all around the apartment, very near to the central station too. I strongly recomend the structure."
5718,"Within easy walking distance of three metro stations, the Seine and the Eiffel Tower.  Clean, comfortable and reasonably spacious rooms with lots of storage/hanging space and a large en suite bathroom. Friendly staff.  A pleasant courtyard area to sit in during good weather and a small but comfortable lounge/bar. It was recommended to us and I would recommend it to others."
5719,"The Dorisol complex consists of three tower blocks set on a steep hillside - Buganvilia (nearest the road), Estrelicia and Mimosa high up the hill.  To get to the shared reception of Estrelicia and Mimosa there are over 160 broad, shallow steps with a handrail and benches to rest every 50 steps.  Taxis, minibuses and jeeps can get up to the reception.  I didn't see a coach drive up.  The Dorisol has very friendly and helpful staff.  The rooms are small but clean and adequate.  There is a charge to use the safe.  The food is buffet style but with rather limited choice.  The outdoor pool area is fairly stark with some old sunbeds.  The indoor swimming pool is great but neither the jacuzzi nor the sauna was working when I went there.  There are massages on offer in the spa but they…"
5720,"This is a great hotel in an excellent location. We stayed here for 5 nights in a standard room and added breakfast when we booked. The rooms were lovely and clean. There is a nice courtyard outside between the buildings with seating and tables and chairs. They permitted us to bring our wine outside even though there is a bar in the lobby. The front desk staff were friendly and provided us with wine glasses and ice. Breakfast in the morning was excellent and included tea/coffee, juices, pastries (awesome chocolate croissants), breads, cold cuts, cheese, fruit, yogurt, etc..   There is a lift but it stops in between the floors so you will have to bring your luggage up/down about 8-10 steps. The room size is typical of Paris and not overly spacious. This was fine for us but if you…"
5721,The hotel looks rather new but the smelling of the room is terrible. Wifi is not stable that made me annoyed as well. The food is poor. It even has no own beach. I have to across the street to go to the beach. The staff is not willing to support when we need to ask something. Staying here is my wrong choice.
5723,Place is outdated! Bad location with homeless people outside! Restaurant was terrible . Pretends to be in Italian restaurant but no not even close! Housekeeping did not do their job. They offer you to go on a presentation for a week stay at any RCI location. Instead they give you a RVC certificate which is. Very poor resorts! They promised you a week stay when you see the presentation instead they give you a small one bedroom with a mini kitchen with no balcony! Very dissatisfied
5724,"We stayed here before around 10 years ago, and so when the opportunity arose to repeat the experience for my wife's birthday this year, we jumped at it!  This is one of the grand 5 star Croisette hotels, and it's location right opposite the Palais De Festivals means that it seems to be a favourite of films stars who come for the film festival (there's nice collection of photos through the ages, of film stars, taken at the hotel)  We were greeted by the news that we had been upgraded to a superior partial sea view room which was very nice.  The room was lovely, the bed super comfortable.  And we really appreciated the turndown service with the chocolates on the pillow and the memory-foam foot mat by the bed!   The inclusive breakfast buffet was something else - a real feast, and…"
5725,"We spent 2 nights in Cannes during our vacation and were extremely pleased with this hotel. First - its location cannot be beat. We were using the train to get around the south of France and not having to drag our huge bag across town was a huge perk. You are still within a 5-7 minute walk to the beach and a 2-5 minute walk to all of the restaurants and shopping in town. So the location cannot be beat!  The best perk is the breakfast in the morning and apertifs in the evening! We got to enjoy both on the roof deck which overlooks Cannes. It is a great amenity. The lounge space is available throughout the day, so we were able to get coffee and water at any time.  The staff was friendly and accommodating. Our room was comfortable for 2 - we did not spend much time there as we were…"
5726,"Our room (6th floor) had aircon and the room was lovely. Breakfast was great. Only negative is that you have to walk up a flight of stairs to the reception desk and from there you can take the lift. From the street it looks like nothing but inside it’s modern and clean and comfortable bed, good bathroom. "
5727,"This is not really a hotel, but as the name suggests it is a ""Casa"" that has been renovated into a small hotel. The street view is a door (locked) that then leads into a 3 story building with a lower floor where the staff work from and which also includes the kitchen and dining area. Barro Alto initially looks like it has seen better days but its not as ""slummy"" as it first appears. We booked the small room with a great view for four nights and got what we booked. The room was tiny rather than small with just enough room around the large (and comfortable) bed to move. The bathroom was equally small but functional enough. We even had a tiny balcony. Lucky we travel rather light as there was just enough room for our 2 cases (14kgs each). There is almost no place to put your things…"
5728,"Stayed here for 2 nights during 30+ degree weather and I was very surprised firstly how cool they were to sleep in. It's basic, beds and shelves, that's it but what more do you need?! The communal area with toilets, showers and an eating room were always clean and tidy. Plenty of hot water to shower with. The location is a little bit out of the way but it depends what you are in Berlin for. If you want drinks and cheap food then head to ostkruez, 10 mins on the u-bahn. It's 15-20 into the centre. Would definitely stay again"
5730,"My wife and I stayed here for 6 days and really can't find any flaws to the hotel. Room was nice, tidy and clean, equipped with everything you need for a shorter stay. We got complimentary water and coffee daily which is a plus.  Location is very good in our opinion, close to a bunch of metro stops, one of which is a major one with something like 6 lines. Street is busy but sound insulation is really good so it is really not a problem. Staff was friendly and helpful.  And last but not the least, price is very reasonable. It is good value for money."
5731,Misrepresentation of the accommodations I would receive. I was guaranteed the room I requested but at check-in I received something totally different from what I was told I would get. I could have booked for way cheaper if I knew I would get the room they gave me .
5732,"Throughly enjoying this hotel. Spotless, modern and central. The reception staff and extremely obliging. The rooms are spacious enough with adequate wardrobe space. Small kitchen area and huge bath towels. Would most certainly recommend. One advisory.....if you want to have the window open at night, ask for a room around the back. The noise from the very busy main road at the front is incessant and you can smell the fumes in the room. However the bed is so comfy you sleep despite this!"
5733,We stayed three nights and found this a pleasant and comfortable place to stay. While it isn't in the most upmarket part of Paris it was convenient to transport and easy to get to anywhere you want to go.
5734,"Reception staff was helpful and friendly. The size of the room was good with very comfortable bed and pillows. Restaurant staff needs to improve in the service and the food as part of all inclusive was good at times ( mainly during dinner) however you could see loads of leftover from previous days and the quality wasn't good. Good spa facilities, sauna, steam room ."
5736,Overall unsatisfying:  - reception staff is unfriendly; - check-in and check-out process is cumbersome and takes ages; - my final invoice showed drinks from other people and had to be removed; - rooms are small and old-fashioned; - elevators do not seem to work properly (we almost always had to take the stairs); - you pay extra for the SPA; and - food is not great.  I will not be a return customer. 
5737,"Being a IHG-Member, we booked a Club-Room for 2 nights, high floor.   The room itself was more or less basic, very good bathroom however;  the view made it good as we had a spectacular city-view; the lounge has no windows, as enclosed in the back , but serves good quality drinks - real Taittinger-champagne - and snacks.   To walk downtown is far, especially as you have to climb all the way when you return. We asked to stay 2 more nights - the answer was: IMPOSSIBLE- even after discussing with the Front Manager on duty.  When I pointed out that on their website all kind of rooms were available, we were told 'there is a waiting list, come back tomorrow' We are no beggars, so decided to leave after 2 nights.  For a hotel of these standards, we found this very unpolite towards a…"
5738,"The hotel does not have an ""Outdoor Pool"" although they list this as an amenity on the hotels official website. The funny thing is, I even chatted with a Holiday Inn representative online who took the time to call this hotel for me and confirm that their pool was just added in January and only open from 3pm - 9pm. After flying 20+ hours from Arizona and then arriving at the hotel, every employee I asked said that the hotel never had a swimming pool.  Besides the swimming pool issue, the hotel was not bad. The room was nice with two free water bottles replenished daily and a good selection of satellite TV channels (around 10 of them). However, the TV was definitely outdated. No wireless internet was available in the rooms but you could pay (I think 50+ RMB/day) for wired…"
5739,"Stayed here as part of an organised tour.  On the positive side the room and bathroom were of a good size, very clean, good wifi and staff were good.  On the negative side the breakfast was below par no hot food at all, its located a fair distance from the city and not many shops around the hotel.  Would we stay again, probably not."
5740,We have stayed here twice now and it does the job required. Location just right for us as metro is close and it's away from the hustle bustle of the centre. Parking below was convenient and plenty of eateries along rue du cremee 
5741,"After having many problems with the air conditioner, I registered a complaint and this time it was finally working. Internet access is very poor also. I had problems trying to access it and informed that I should get in touch with a tech support guy. Well, the trouble was so huge that I prefered to use the internet over my cellphone (3G). Overall, despire all the problems with the AC that prevented me from sleeping one night and the internet access, it is an OK hotel."
5742,"We stayed at Hotel La Parizienne for 2 nights last week and couldn't have been happier with the choice of hotel. We were surprised with a free room upgrade on arrival and could not complain about the room, it was a lovely size, very clean and had everything you need. They also have a phone you can take out with you, we didn't use this but it is a nice touch and I am sure very helpful for some. There is also free wifi in the room. We didn't have breakfast so cannot comment on this. You can catch the hop on hop off bus just a few seconds up the road and there are also lots of restaurants nearby. We also visited montparnasse tower which is a few minutes walk away and I would highly recommend this. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again. Thanks!"
5743,"This hotels is quite close to the river and the Berlin Wall. The public transport, both S and U Bahn are easily accessible. The Berlin OstBahnhof station is 10 mins by walk. To sum up, Good breakfast, clean rooms, well maintained. Good wifi in my room. "
5744,"So let's clarify - the word boutique means small. And by small I mean absolutely tiny. The room we booked was so small, only one of us could walk around the bed at the one time and although the storage is cute and makes use of every single nook and cranny - there was nowhere really to store our clothes for the trip except on a few hangers on either side of the mirror opposite the bed, which poked you as you tried to walk around the room. The bed was firm which was lovely but the pillows were so soft I woke up with a sore neck from the lack of pillow support. The bathroom was in a little pod which was a funky design but each time I had a shower I wondered how it would get clean due to the surface being so bumpy. Amenities OK, thank you for the shower caps. Great location, close…"
5745,"This comfortable hotel, with excellent free wifI, is tucked into a little street that's under two blocks from the Boissiere Metro stop on the 6 Line that runs from the Charles de Gaulle Etoile hub.  The reception staff are bright, genteel and accommodating.  I found them very willing and able to phone in my dinner reservations, store my luggage, and answer all sorts of questions about Paris.  Khalid and  Paula were particularly gracious and helpful, which really enhanced my experience of the hotel and the city. The room itself was attractive, quiet and comfortable, recently renovated and with adequate storage space, a safe and a good-sized TV.  The bathroom was well-designed, with a strong shower, large sink, decent amenities and good mirrors.  Excellent maid service kept…"
5747,"Pros: Great location, comfortable rooms, healthy breakfast and friendly staff. We really enjoyed our stay.   Cons: One of the rooms we booked was a ‘superior’ room, but we asked to switch it as it had no natural light and was outside a noisy air vent. Room was switched easily but for a small additional charge as the new room was better.   The swimming pool is really small!!!! "
5748,"We stayed in this hotel when having a few days in Berlin. The hotel is well positioned for bus/tram stops as well as the nearby underground. The staff are both friendly and very knowledgeable, and the buffet breakfast one of the best we have had even at far more expensive hotels. The hotel is old, but very clean and the bedrooms are much larger than many other city hotels."
5749,"My husband and I celebrated our 34th wedding anniversary here.  It was a beautiful facility,the location was just perfect, and the staff were so kind and helpful.  We were very impressed with this hotel and would definitely stay here again. They really know how to take care of their guests."
5750,"The best thing about this place is the staff -they are very hospitable, courteous and helpful. I am sorry Shruti, I can not use superlatives so freely. The place is a bit in accessible and the nearest place where we could find vegetarian food and some articles of daily use was Fira which used to cost us $10 for every trip. Food quality was not much to write home about. I missed hot and steaming freshly brewed coffee in the mornings. The rooms are a bit oldfashioned and one of my daughters had to make do with a somewhat inferior room. My wife's 60th birthday went off with great fanfare, what with my two jewels - my daughters being there and our lovely granddaughter making our time even more pleasurable. Overall, we had a good time."
5751,"American Airlines canceled our direct TPA-ORD flight so we had to re-schedule a flight for the night before in order to make our international flight connection. I decided to stay at the Hilton since it is conveniently located within the terminal. We arrived to the hotel late at night and very tired. I am  a Hilton Honors member and had requested an upgrade through the Hilton website. No mention of this upgrade was made at check-in. No complimentary water was offered. The >$300/night room was very small and not well appointed at all. We ordered a late night snack through room service (the selection was very limited) and ended up paying almost $80 for one sandwich, one salad, and one diet coke. To add insult to injury, the next day our bill showed a charge for Wi-Fi, which of…"
5752,"Eastseven is an excellent hostel. Staff are very helpful, the hostel is always clean and well kept. The kitchen is especially good as it has everything you would need! I did end up sharing with one strange guy who was a long term stayer at the hostel and never went out, but he was harmless so no problems there. The hostel is a little further out from the sites - maybe a 25 minute walk from Museum island. "
5753,"Great hotel. Perfect location...walked almost everywhere and the Hop on Hop off bus stop was just steps from the front door! Plenty of restaurants nearby!  The staff were fabulous and very helpful with booking tours, giving directions as well as day to day assistance at the hotel. The property is very clean and well maintained. The breakfast was plentiful and the service was very good. Our room was very well appointed with lots of room for 2 adults. Overall we enjoyed it very much and would easily stay again and recommend to others."
5754,"The staff was very friendly and the place was very clean inside. But this hotel in the homeless area isn't any nicer or better than a motel 6 except for the staff. First our rooms weren't ready at check in time. wtf??? at $300 a night and a room rack rate of $1800 a night I expect way more. This is an ecology hotel mean, cheap as fuok. No water on arrival, then no water pressure. Was offered to go to a sister property for a shower. How nice of them. The rooms are really small, think, half the size of a motel 6 or travel lodge. No little shampoos or conditioners, its all shared. How nasty. signs everywhere, they don't want to change your linens nor towels. Cheapos!!! Yeah ecological hotel... Then at 8am without warning there was a big, scary man peeping through the window.…"
5755,"Loved this hotel, the rooms were big and very comfortable, the staff were very friendly and the location was perfect for us as it’s a 5 minute walk to the train station and to shopping and restaurants. We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back!"
5757,"This hotel has a very good location and the first impression is good, but overall the hotel is outdated and does not at all live up to the standard of a five star hotel.   The shower had very low pressure and the makeup mirror was burned on the back and dirty. The halls was extremely dark with almost no light, making it creepy at night. Our room was not cleaned during the day despite note on the door to clean the room, and we had to call for new shampoo and towels. We also asked to borrow an  The top floor with pool and gym was very humid and also appeared a bit unkept. Our room was also situated next to a hotel service room, so we woke up by noise early in the morning.   Best part was the lobby, a good breakfast and nice and helpful staff, although some lacked English skills.  …"
5758,"We stayed at this hotel for a few nights. It is close to the city center although you have to walk a lot to reach the Museum Island because of the reconstruction works nearby. The room was nice and spacious, typical Novotel quality. The breakfast selection was good."
5759,The hotel is  very busy which is fine but it was just too noisy. Double glazing is needed to block out the noise from the street at night. We had a city view room which meant that we were woken up 4.30am each morning as rubbish was collected and deliveries were made to nearby shops and hotels. I was more tired when I left than when I arrived. I did speak to a concierge about the noise and was told it was because I had a city view room and noise has to be expected.
5760,"Quirky excellent hotel very conveniently located next to the Gare St Lazare.  Great fun, nice amenities and very clean - we can fully recommend it.  Also, unbelievably quiet given that the hotel is bang in the middle of Paris."
5761,"We first were allocated an in refurbished suite and experienced various problems, the main one being cold. After a few days of trying to fix the problem we were moved to a refurbished suite that was lovelyRest of hotel plus staff was very good, with a lovely breakfast restaurant with an exceptional choice of quality food"
5762,"My parents and I stayed in one room (City of Love with your parents... why not?) and had the time of our lives.  We expected to be totally cramped (in addition to cramping my style) but there was enough space in the room for all of us, which is truly an achievement in Europe.  My wife's from Texas, where everything is yuuuuge, so this was a pleasant surprise.  (Yep, I did Paris sans wife.  I'll be hearing about this one for a while.)    The staff was very, very friendly and helpful.  I wish I could recall the supervisor's name but imagine a French version of Stanley Tucci in The Devil Wears Prada.  Sarah and Olga were the sweetest and went absolutely above and beyond on every request.  The hotel, including our room, is spotless.  The shower is amazing - phenomenal water…"
5763,My husband and i have just come back from our honeymoon in San Francisco and can say we were not impressed by the hotel at all. The bed was tiny only really room for one person and it was suppose to be a double bed. There was only one pillow each when we arrived so we had to complain to get more. The room was dirty and the paintwork was chipped. The rooms do not even have a safe which most hotels in America offer for free. We did however get a saftey deposit box but everytime we wanted to use it we got escorted there and it was not very private. The hotel lack a shop all it had was an overpriced minibar. The staff were lazy and could not be bothered with us the only time they were intrested was on the last day when we checked out and were waiting on a lift they were hoping that…
5764,"Eventually found the apartment block, 10mins walk from the station.  Apartment was good overlooking the canal  though a little warm with little ventilation. I'm glad it was only early 20s as I think in very hot weather the apartment would be unbearable to sleep in.   Thin walls you could hear children crying and footwork from above.  Plenty of towels which was good, though  only one fan!  The main gripe for us was no written paperwork on how to use the oven etc, nothing in the Yays app either.  It meant we could not cook the food we had bought for the first evening. I managed to suss the hob and dishwasher but the oven was a no go!!    After an early start next day we then had to go back early  to see concierge to get instructions, even then she did not know fully but did try to…"
5765,"We stayed at this hotel in Recoleta for the second time in 3 years. The room/apartment was really spacious and well appointed, representing good value for money in the upmarket category. Unfortunately, this time the front office staff were a major disappointment, being generally indifferent to guest problems (such as the wifi in the rooms not working), to failing to failing to book an airport transfer after having undertaking to do so. It caused us to book a different hotel in BA when we returned at the end of our trip. Not recommended."
5766,"Fine hotel with a great, first floor breakfast room which served a wide variety of food. The twin beds in my room were very comfortable and it had a rain forest shower in the bathroom. My room didn't have much of a view, but faced a courtyard and some apartments; this meant that, although I didn't have much of a view, I could keep my window open at night without being disturbed. I found getting around from here very easy as the hotel's within a minute's walk of an U bahn station (U6) with trams and buses close by. Although I like to try out different hotels in cities that I revisit, I'd quite happily stay here again.  "
5768,We are a family of four and we stayed a week in Casa Mea. The hotel is located in the heart of the old city. The hotel is quite expensive and I expected more from their staff and service. During the first two days I was sure that I came to the wrong place. Sitting for breakfast and dinner and the construction didn't stop. It was noisy and right next to all outside tables where they serve their meals. Sitting outside wouldn't solve the noise issue. The air condition didn't work in our room for at least 4 days. outside temperatures were 29-32 centigrade so at night it was like a nightmare. The hotel compensate us for dinner we had. But I expect from such high class hotel for a better compensation.
5769,"My experience with this hotel ended upon check-in.  Though I had booked the 3-bdrm apartment months in advance, I was informed upon arrival that my reservation had been cancelled.  The reason I was given for this was that my credit card was expired, which was ridiculous as I was able to produce my perfectly valid card to the clerk.  I also received no notice (NONE) that my reservation had been revoked, so after driving all day with confirmation # and valid credit card in hand, we were turned away.  No apology, no compensation offered...nice."
5770,"From the moment I walked through the front door, I was stunned by how awful it felt, like walking into a casino or airport. Dozens of people were sitting and milling around, a large bar blocked the registration desk, and then there was a long line to register. I can't imagine why anyone would choose to stay here, it wasn't even a good rate! The room was fine, but the area the hotel is located in is not interesting or clean, and it's just not a good feel overall. So many better places to stay, imho."
5771,"I should have heeded the bad reviews on this place.  I was stupid and decided to give this place a chance.  I booked this hotel through a well reputed travel site 6 months in advance of our stay in San Francisco.  One month before our stay I called and confirmed with the hotels manager Amish (spelling?).  He confirmed the reservation, but there was a problem with the rooms he had us reserved in, he fixed it and put us into a suite and a king (as my reservation showed). I attempted to call the hotel for 2 days prior to our arrival to again confirm and received a recording that the phone had been disconnected (evidently they were having problems).  Upon arrival we were told we did not have a reservation in their system and that it looked to them as if we had cancelled it in…"
5772,For us an excellent location as reasonably close to U bahn and as a bonus a Christmas Market. Very friendly staff and the FREE breakfast was great too. Our room was very quiet and spotlessly clean too. An excellent package for someone who just wants a base to get to and from all the well kmown sights.
5773,"A fair to middling hotel. On the plus side relatively well situated for metro network with a station within 150 metres (Augosto 24) therefore no need to take a taxi from the airport.  Staff were friendly and on the whole  helpful, rooms were clean and comfortable. Good breakfast.  Could do with a bit of a refresh and area seen better days."
5774,"Beautiful hidden hotel located on streets of Paris just blocks from Arc de Triomphe, metro and lots of shops. Eiffel Tower is not far either. The hotel was very clean and the girls at the front desk were very friendly and accommodating. "
5775,I stayed for two nights at the end of October. The customer service I received was outstanding (in particular the Argentinian behind the bar and Graham the maintenance man) but the accommodation itself wasn't the best. I paid €100 for the two nights. Very fun and social vibe. Should probably paint over the vegemite painting in one of the dorms :P 
5777,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Feel at Home. The location is brilliant being so close to everything and the apartment was very comfortable with everything you need. The staff were very friendly and helpful, good suggestions all round. The apartment only missed out on a 5* as it was quite noisy on the roadside room at night - the other bedroom or apartment on the other side or ear plugs and it would have been 5*"
5778,"After 7 great stays/experiences I am thoroughly disappointed with my current one. My wife and I booked a suite for 2 nights at a cost of $1300.00 and the room we got was nothing but less impressive. We contacted the hotel to inform them that we would be checking a little later in the evening around 9pm due to obligations involving the celebrating of our 25 year anniversary. The hotel stated they would make a note and that it would not be a problem. Little then did we know by checking in at 9:30pm we would be given the least desirable suite left. It is very small, almost the same size of a standard room based on my previous stays. The suite we booked the previous year was outstanding which is why we were surprised. We also did not request a handicap room it is. When I went down…"
5779,"I'm rather surprised that L'Hotel is rated #1 hotel in Sao Paolo as my experience here had not been that great.  First, the staff do not seem to understand English very well, so we had problems communicating our needs.  Second, the rooms and bathroom are very small, though there's a nice touch as they provide Havaianas slippers for our use.  Third, the restaurant is extremely pricey for the quality of the food served and they actually charge 12 reals for 3 small pieces of bread and spread (first time I was charged for bread in South America).  But what upsets me the most is that when we returned to our room to check-out (10 minutes before check-out time), we found the door open, the cleaner had obviously decided to ignore the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign and do some cleaning up and…"
5780,"The hotel is chic and stylish and people were photographing it from the street. However, apart from the girls on the reception the rest is a shambles! At breakfast there were no clear tables, no tea, coffee or juice out and the service  plates are that small that if there are two people infront of you, you may have to wait for them to be refilled! We went down the road as I hate to start my day pissed off."
5781,"The Hotel Eiffel Blomet is a wonderful hotel nestled within the heart of Paris, with the Eiffel tower only 20min walk and what a wonderful walk it is. It very conveniently located close to the metro station.  The rooms have an air of quality and offered a very comfortable retreat from the day of site seeing. The staff were very helpful and very polite. I have already recommneded the hotel to friends and family and would most definitely return."
5782,"I can't think of many hotel reviews where the room lighting is the focus, but that is the major negative issue we had with the Inspira Santa Marta. Overall it is a nice hotel with good staff, but their ""multi-category"" lighting switch system, combined with insufficient lighting in the bathroom and none at all in the doorway where the safe is, left me using a flashlight constantly to get around.  A further poor design issue  is that the wall that separates the bathroom from the bedroom is not a full wall -  there is a large opening between the bathroom and bedroom, such that the noise and light from one person using the bathroom will disturb their partner who is still trying to sleep. The good: The staff I dealt with were friendly and helpful and spoke excellent English.  The…"
5784,"I was on holiday with my daughter, 9 years old and she and I had a really nice stay. It is a very clean and nice little hotel, close to the U-bahn, museums and parks. The staff is very helpful and the breakfast is good.   I would stay here again."
5785,"I spent 5nights in this hotel with my partner to celebrate our 2nd anniversary. The room didnt suit to our wishes unluckily. We got an old room without the air conditioner, the shower's cabin was damaged...the wardrobe was very small.. telephone wasnt working, so couldnt call the receptionist in case. Breakfast was always the same without any varieties. When we wished to ask the staff about 'the airport shuttle' as it was mentioned on their website, the girl looked so suprised what we were talking about.... she said :,,we can call the cab, but we dont have any service regarding the shuttle.. - well OMG we thought why is it on the web then??? - she wrote my boyfriend's name and our room number on a piece of paper. Later we asked the receptionist again about the confirmation and…"
5786,"We stayed there in October 2018, and the woman at reception was rude when we complained that the sink had a chip in it, the room smelt damp, and the safe was coming off the wall, rather than securely attached to it,and the lock looked damaged too. She kept saying ""it's not my fault, your travel agent booked a basic room"". We also had our debit card swallowed by a bank, and she told us that no one puts their card in a debit machine on sundays, in case of problems, and kept repeating this, which was unhelpful, as we were already distressed about losing our card. The second room was better, but the curtains were not clean. However the breakfast was quite basic, with the coffee being good one day, and undrinkable the next day. The woman serving breakfast was unhelpful, and not…"
5787,So - I did not get a chance to actually review the hotel/rooms.  It was in a convenient location for my business meetings (more convenient than the Westin - where they organised for me to be moved).  If you decide on a policy of overbooking rooms - then you risk the occasional 1-star rating for someone who turns up after a long flight to be told their confirmed room was not available.
5788,Nice hotel in a great location. Friendly staff and we had a really spacious room. This hotel is near to excellent underground connections for those not wanting to walk everywhere. Lots of great tourist sites are located within walking distance and there are plenty of coffee shops and restaurants close to the hotel.
5789,"We stayed in this hotel 3 times in 2 weeks ( 5 nights all up) as part of a tour group of 20. The first couple of times we stayed was OK but just! The last time was so below par, the front desk staff on all occasions were not pleasant and gave the impression we were interrupting and irritating them. A smile goes a long way. The breakfast opens at different times, depending on how organised the staff are before opening. The selection at breakfast is more leaning towards Indian fare, western variety if limited and not up to the usual standard, very disappointing compared to other hotels we stayed in India. There is an abundance of staff during breakfast but unfortunately they look like lost children not knowing what to do, so roam aimlessly around the dining room. Our Room…"
5790,"Nice trendy hotel with good price/quality rate. Everything here is tricolore red - white - blue Room is nice with inside bathroom ,but not soundproof. Breakfast buffet is large for French standards. Free use of soft drinks and water from the refrigerator and in the afternoon free snacks and beverage in the cosy breakfastroom. 3 minutes walk to Metro and situated in a nice neighbourhood"
5791,"All the water in this hotel is salty! I do not know why! When we brush our teeth, the water is salty from the tap. When we bath, it is the same! Worse was, my friend tried to boil some water to make tea and it tastes salty!   Other than the above, the housekeeping was not up to par. Rooms didn't feel clean at all and the balcony is dusty. We book two rooms but they had to give us separate rooms with another room in between us, even though I am sure we requested for connecting rooms. If you do not have connecting rooms, at least give us rooms side by side?? And to think that we booked the rooms months in advance!  It does have a great view of the sea with its sunset and close proximity to the beach. The pool is a decent size but it is sandy near where the exit to the beach was.…"
5792,"Check-in was terrible, resort fee is a stupid payment. Staff for check-in and out is not skilled enough. As a hilton honors member, I didn't like it... I will never stay here in the future and not advice to my friends..."
5793,"I live in NYC but I was born French, so when I get back to paris I like to spoil myself. I love the district of the Place Saint Sulpice, and this time I booked at the Esprit St Germain.... from the street you cannot imagine the elegance, coziness, sophistication of this place. The staff is extremely kind, polite and helpful, and the common area makes you feel at home. You can share a glass of wine or tea with a friend, even order some nibbles with it!!! Rooms are comfortable, with all the amenities you need, WiFi works ok, maybe better in the lounge. I loved the smell in the hallways and the discretion of the staff making your room. Definitely a place to book if you like subtile luxury. I will come back. Thank you "
5794,"This hostel was good because location was ideal so you could walk to all the main attractions in Amsterdam. Although it was cheap they catch you in other ways by only letting you buy a towel (not rent) for 5 euro and same with locks. Luggage storage is 20 cents an hour, which isn't a lot but the receptionist got mad when we wanted to share lockers with the people we were with to save a little bit of money. The lighting in the rooms was poor as well you could hardly see anything. The good things were the location, it was cheap, breakfast was included, and it was clean. If I were to come back I'd stay elsewhere though because there are tons of hostels in Amsterdam with good locations that I'm sure are much nicer."
5795,"As SPG gold member, we expect much better service though we stayed during the holiday. We got king bed Bund view room though I expect I received much greater upgrade. The room itself is quite strange especially the bathroom. The design is strange and the size is so small, and also the toilet. The room is quite nice with the view. Now the bad thing is, often we smell smoke especially inside the bathroom and the toilet. Please check your exhaust or maybe the air conditioning. Or maybe during our stay, there was someone smoked from above. I was really disappointed to get this room. The housekeeping tried to refresh the room but it did not solve the problem. Or maybe it is the heater's smell which I do not think so. The breakfast selection is quite huge and the tastes are OK. They…"
5796,"Fantastic well tended grounds, well appointed rooms with friendly reception staff boded well. However on our first night the room was so hot and the aircon didn't appear to be working. On mentioning it to the reception desk I was told that it had been turned off as guests were complaining of being cold but they would send a fan up to the room. The fan duly arrived but it was so noisy that we could not sleep with it running. The following night we tried to sleep with the French doors open but that was also too much noise from outside. It then occurred to me that if the system was switched on people who didn't want it running in their rooms didn't have to turn it on so I went back to reception where I discovered that apparently there is only one system for the entire hotel and it…"
5797,"I stood at the Blue Tree for 2 days only - fortunately - as a part of my last business trip. There were hundreds and hundreds of guests, and it was a mess. The restaurant looked more like a pub than to a restaurant during breakfast time: I was there between 7am and 8am and you were lucky if you could get a table. People was walking all over the place and there was no room for everybody. Also, there was a (considerably long) line to check in and check out....  It is an expensive place - SP is an expensive city - , but it doesn´t worth it. The halls, rooms and furniture it´s a bit outdated - clean, though -. In my personal case, the room was small - I stood at the 11th floor -. I suggest you to make sure you get a bigger one if you stay for more than 2 days. The location is good,…"
5798,"This new hotel - one year old- is designed very nicely, creating a warm and contemporary atmosphere. Staff is very attentive, rooms are small but nice. Airco very quiet. Bathroom is excellent with spacious shower. Breakfast is super, with small buffet and egg dishes and cold cuts served at the table. "
5799,"We have been on a whistle stop tour of the USA staying in budget hotels.  Most have been fine and accommodating.  This one however was without doubt the worst hotel we have ever stayed in anywhere.  The rooms are old fashioned, dreary and depressing. On entering our room it stank of bleach cleaner.  The bath was ingrained with stains and the bed uncomfortable.  The hair dryer sent off sparks when switched on.  We had to ask the manager twice to fix it.  He displayed no interest in his customers whatsoever.  Breakfast (we avoided it) is served standing up in the tiny reception.  On descending the outside steps in the morning we had to inch past a vagrant sleeping on the steps (not his fault and we bought him breakfast, but not what you expect to see).  We bailed out one night…"
5800,"This hotel is an apartment hotel, giving facilities to enable you to eat in the room and only have bed and breakfast if you wish. We decided that this was the way for us, we stayed in Funchal last year and walked past this hotel so thought we would give it a go this year. The hotel is in a really prime position with all the rooms having a sea view, we stayed in room 817, the balcony is huge, you are not overlooked and the sun is on the balcony most of the day, lovely if you like to sunbathe and prefer your own company. There was a bedroom, seating/lounge/dining area and small kitchenette, with a kettle, two ring hob and a fridge/sink etc. The downside- the hotel and rooms were cleaned everyday and there were no issues with the housekeeping, however the rooms are in need of some…"
5801,"The location is perfect, just beside Gare L'est and close to Gare de Nord.  The room was very clean. Quite small, but big enough for a short stay. The breakfast tasteful. Small breakfast room, but cosy.  The service was good. Definitely worth the money."
5802,"I had made a few calls to front desk the day before check in to inquire about early check in.  Each time I was either transferred to the wrong person, hung up on and in one case not really given the time of day and just told to ""show up and they'll see what they could do"".  The room I was originally checked into had black mold on the vents.  Their was quite the wait during the check in process , they were clearly understaffed at the front desk every time I went past.  My status as a World of Hyatt member clearly meant nothing as the World of Hyatt desk was just taking everybody that came along.  I didn't even get the complimentary water!  They didn't even honor my late checkout request, we're supposed to get 2pm, I was told 12pm.  And the area around this hotel is disgusting,…"
5803,"I agree room 200 avoid. They play music in the lobby all hours and it gets up into that room. The employees don’t care! The gentlemen in the morning is the same one I had, tried to blame it on the customer and never apologizes. Oh yes you will see the hotel respond at the bottom of this lousy review. “Oh were very sorry about your ooor experience, we care, blah, blah blah. Oh really then why did’nt you respond to my 3 emails directly to you?  My advice  spend an extra $50 and get a quality hotel. Over 50% of the reviews are bad that’s a pretty high number. If half of your customers were mad would you still be in business?"
5804,"The Cost of parking at $45.00 and taken down to $25.00 with a $3.50 tax equals $28.50 and this Best Western Motel should have been showed this cost before I Checked In! and the rooms did not have a refrigerator and the bed sheet had a Big Brown square color (Burn?) on it and my guest and we got a rash on different parts of our body from that room! this Best Western Motel was ""Very Bad!"" and there was a Big Pile of towels by the outside window and Front Door and Traffic Noise."
5805,The staff is unprofessional and they overcharged me. Parking is $55 each night. But the accommodations aren’t worth it. They charged me for a water that they gave me even though I’m a Hilton member. At other locations they always give/offer Hilton members a complimentary water. When I asked the water to be refunded they were slow and unapologetic about the mix up.
5806,My wife and I stayed one night to experience Chicago.  The room had a hole in the floor under the carpet between the bed and the TV.  There wasn't enough hot water to last for a 5 min shower.  The parking was being remodeled which was a big inconvenience not to mention I was charged $25 to park that we were not informed of when reserving.  There is no breakfast but there is a restaurant attached to the hotel.  The road noise in the room was very loud.  The picture quality of the TV was poor at best.  Someone should tell the manager that there is HD TV available.  All the staff were friendly.
5807,"I was not greeted as a Honors member. I was not provided an upgrade. The food was ordered medium and both times was received beyond well done. The manager did comp one meal, but not the other. The prices in the bar are absurd. They charge 10 star prices for 2 star service and quality. I am sure many people visit the hotel for business, as was my case, but I still recognize good and bad. This hotel did not meet my experience with Hiltons. I would not recommend this hotel."
5808,"We stayed three nights for my boyfriend’s birthday. The staff were really friendly and couldn’t do enough for us; they contacted me beforehand to suggest decorating the room with balloons and leaving out a birthday beer. The staff were also happy to help with bookings recommendations.   Breakfast at Benedict was included for us (via Expedia): it was great and the restaurant is popular with locals. We got there around 8.30am each morning and didn’t have a wait but if it’s past 9am, you can call reception to put you on the waiting list so it’s not a problem.   We stayed in a Small room; it was cosy but fine given a short stay. The room was generally clean and the Crosley player and decor were nice touches.   However, it could be greatly improved with just a few easy tweaks to…"
5810,"We stayed 2 nights at the Waldorf Shanghai from 16 Jan to 18 Jan 2016.   Ninety-five per cent of our time there was very good. Check in was smooth and as Diamond members, we were upgraded to a River View room, which we're appreciative of. Quality of breakfast at the Grand Brasserie was excellent - a la carte omelettes and a good variety of buffet items, with attentive service. We also had a chance to have a few drinks at the Long Bar, which served decent cocktails and features live jazz at night. We also enjoyed the Red Velvet high tea in Salon de Ville - pastries were of a quality not often found in China.  However, our low rating for the Waldorf Shanghai can be attributed to the insipid service we experienced when leaving the hotel.  We checked out of the hotel at 5pm on the…"
5811,"Stayed there for 7 nights, but been complaining almost every night about the air-condition temperature. Although every room has a self set monitor for air-condition, however, i noticed that their central unit is the 1 controlling the overall temperature.  I know this as only the front office is able to call the engineering team to reduce the temperature to a cooler setting. IF engineering doesn't get the call from front office due to complains from guest, they will then set the central to 23 celsius which is very warm for a person who is used cold room during sleep. I was told by their own Front Office Manager that engineering is not following their instruction of maintaining the air-condition at 20 celsius.   However, the FO manager sent us a complimentary plate of dessert to…"
5812,"The location is terrible!!! Dont beleive is close to Union Sq because it is not! Scary location to walk at night. The when we got to the bed room the AC doesn't work, It sounds like a airplane engine. The breakfast is not from the hotel. The hotel gives you tickets of 6$ to go in front to a dinner calls costum burger, the its not part of the hotel. Its a really trash food, all is expensive and your 6$ ticket are only for a banana and a cereal.   I dont recomended ever!!!"
5813,"We stayed here as a large group and had everything we needed - near a tube stop, super market, warm showers, comfy beds, enough sockets and decent wifi.  It's a big hostel so don't expect the cute family feeling, but there is a nice courtyard outside to socialise in.  The best asset was the staff who were all super helpful and friendly - big thanks for printing me off some bus tickets as well as some google maps snap shots that they kindly edited to make easy to read!"
5814,"This is a superb hotel for exploring Berlin. It's very central and all the major sights are within walking distance in one direction or another. It's also very close to a U-Bahn station, handy for the airport. Our room was very nice, comfortable bed, the free wifi worked well and it had a safe for valuables, too. The bathroom was fantastic, with a big double rainfall shower. The room would certainly hold it's own against some of the more expensive hotels on offer in the city. The staff were all very helpful and I'd recommend getting the breakfast included with your booking as it's very good value for money. There is also a spa & pool you can use for an extra €12 per day. It's lovely and a great way to chill out in the evening - though be warned you have to be naked if you wish…"
5816,"Wow! Todays experience topped it off. A five star establishment employed by untrained staff! I have stayed at this hotel before but will never step my foot in it again. I came to have breakfast with my family to the fabulous dinning room space the hotel offers, sadly it was closed and we were directed to their dark bar for breakfast. Few minutes after we got seated someone walked up and offered oj, not hello how re you and what I can get for you? the menu listed about 6 fresh squeezed juices so I asked if what she was offering was that, she said no and said they don't have fresh squeezed  juices as the machine has been broken. For an establishment like Palace hotel it is a dissapoitment  to hear that. Then she took our drink order and left for 15 minutes. I was there with…"
5817,My expectations were high and unfortunately D. Pedro Palace Hotel did not correspond. Its dècor and materials' quality and style are completely out of date for a central capital city five star Hotel. Its market recognition deserves quite an elevated upgrade. The rooms are confortable but one does not really feel dazzled by this five star hotel. It would be great if it undergoes a full modernizing refurbishment in order to captivate its Clients once again.
5818,"The pluses : Hotel and rooms are clean.  Location near some lovely restaurants  Staff helpful and friendly  Free parking on site Free shuttle bus into town and back daily  Easy to walk into town Free access to a PC with Internet in lobby  The downside: Wifi only in lobby and bar area The food is dreadful, really really cheap ingredients  used in meals. We had stayed half board, but apart from a bowl of cereal, toast and fruit in the morning we avoided eating here at all costs! Hotel is dated Small dated potable tv in room  From looking at other reviews much is made of the steep climb from the road - the whole island is mountainous, what do you expect! Yes it is steep (especially after a few drinks) but really not that bad!!!  This is a budget hotel that is a good place to base…"
5819,"The Hotel is in a great location and it’s perfect for the train station, trams, metro or even just walking into the centre. We had a suite which was very spacious and comfortable. The living room area we never used as it lacks warmth and character. By comparison to the bedroom and other rooms it seems very big and cold feeling.  The service needs attention. Whenever we requested anything, more tea bags etc we had to keep asking as nothing happened. The concierge are amazing and very helpful.  "
5820,"There´s a lot of good things to be said about the Wittmore. The staff is really attentive in the reception. The food in the restaurant is great and the decor pretty cool. The minus is not many but they are there. As others have written before; the lights in the rooms are really bad. Yes, it´s cozy and cool in general but it´s making things as packing really difficult. The pool on the roof is not really a pool but a small ""pond"" you can dip your feet in our sit in. That being said the roof-top is really great and the breakfast (which is by ala carte only) is great as well (and served on the roof-top during summer at least)"
5821,"I stayed alone in a superior room for four nights, and my friends shared a deluxe room. My  room was spacious, clean and quiet (even though the windows were facing the street), and my rest there was as calm as a baby. All services needed worked well for me, so I actually have nothing negative to say about the hotel. For my needs, it was well located too. I will most definitely stay there again. And for my friends, it already was their third visit at the Ellington- that says enough does it not?"
5822,"The service is great, also the personnel is great. The position of the hotel is very good, cause it's five minutes far from Alexander Platz (useful also for train station). During the night the street was calm"
5823,The hotel is central with good transport links to the rest of the city whilst being 5-10 mins walk from Alexander Platz. The rooms were clean and the staff helpful. Whilst described as a twin room the beds were pushed together which was not ideal for friends travelling together. The rooms at the front of the hotel (even nos) overlook the busy Prenzlauer Allee and are noisy.  Breakfast was good.
5825,"The hotel is in an ideal spot - close to the majority of amenities and transport.  The people on reception were very helpful.  The room was always clean and you could have the old towels changed every day.  Only had the breakfast once but it was fresh with a variety of breads, meat and cheese, croissants etc.  Would go back again if the opportunity came up."
5826,"We arrived on the scheduled day at 1:40pm. Check-in time was 2:00pm.  We were  supposed to be at a horse show at 2:00pm where my daughter was showing her horse. We were informed by the desk clerks (2) that the hotel has a strict policy to  charge $50.00 to check in early. The room was clean and ready so we said ""it's only 20 minutes"" at which time a person who seemed to be a manager came out from her office and almost gleefully repeated ""it's a strict policy"" and it will be $50.00 to check in even a minute early. If they had said ""I'm sorry but the hotel has a strict policy"", we would have felt better, but the words ""I'm sorry"" were never used by any employee. The attitude of the manager made us feel like we were trying to steal from the hotel. Unfortunately when you have an…"
5827,"There is no elevator it smells terrible and the ""shared bathrooms"" are disgusting the bathtubs need to be replaced. While I was there the hotel was being sprayed for pests  this place doesn't deserve half a star"
5828,"We had a great visit at this hotel for 5 days.  The location is very near to the Conference Center.  Easy subway / metro access.   Very nice, clean rooms.   The staff is amazing!  They are VERY accomodating, and helpful.  The management is also stellar.  Thank you for the very nice stay and help!  We hope to be able to return soon.   Aimable leads a great team on the Front Desk.   THANK YOU!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
5830,"We had 3 days in this Hotel in March. We had a nice room on the 1st floor, the breakfast ok, it gets very crowded. We had a meal in the Restaurant on the first night, quite expensive only 1 other couple eating, very few guest eat in the Restaurant at night, they do snacks in bar but very limited menu. The downside was the location ok to walk down into the town but very steep coming back, not many nice eating places near by.staff very good, the provide push bikes for your use."
5831,"Whilst there were many great things about the Grandom Suites there were also a few little areas that weren't great. Firstly the location is excellent, walking distance to some great sights and near some really quality restaurants which we loved. The main issue was the room wasn't up to what was advertised. We were expecting 'city views' and we got a view of houses and a car park. The toiletries were a shampoo/body wash dispenser in the shower. Whilst I don't mind these and they stop a lot of waste, I also expect a bar of soap to wash my hands. I don't think it's reasonable to have to stand in the tub to get some soap to wash my hands. The apartment was nicely furnished and a pleasant place to stay however the bathroom and kitchen were quite aged. The bathroom had a bad smell…"
5832,"On the plus side, the hotel is situated in an  excellent central position, staff are helpful  (especially front desk) and breakfast is decent quality and served in a pleasant room.   Less positive was our bedroom. I'd booked and paid two months earlier but was told, on arrival, that the top floor room we'd requested wasn't available 'because the hotel was full'. Nonsense - it would have been straightforward to allocate us a room on the floor we'd asked for. Consequently, we were disturbed by the people above walking around on wooden floorboards.   Our room was as requested at the back of the hotel - the hotel fronts onto a busy street. But it was tiny!  C'mon guys, this isn't Tokyo! Though the bed was a decent size and comfortable, the wardrobe, bathroom, general room space was…"
5833,"Nice hotel with very good design and very well located. But i faced small incidents (breakfast without coffee, not clean towel). However, it should be an exception, so i would come back for my next trip in Amsterdam"
5834,Great little boutique hotel. Small but awesome rooms.  Left my computer mouse there 5 months ago. Didn't even know I did. Checked in and mouse was presented. Wow!! Now that is great service.   Love this Hotel and their service. 
5835,"Nice hotel in great location.  However this stay was really spoilt by the guests in the next room who were smoking (despite the fact that it is a no-smoking hotel).  The smell of cigarette smoke came through the air conditioning and was permanently in the corridor which was pretty gross.  We told reception, but nothing was done (they could have offered us a room on another floor, for example).  Also, not great sound insulation between rooms.  Disappointing given we’d paid for a premium room."
5836,"This was the least successful hotel of a 3 month trip.   Pro: Good location , helpful staff, clean  Cons: Tiny, dated bedroom, smokey hallway, basic breakfast offering, grubby looking pool ( beyond tiny), poor value for the standards offered, unreliable wifi"
5837,"This stay I had at the this hotel was horrible.  I stayed for 4 night, on the first night I went into my room and they had given me two double beds. I immediately went down and asked for my room to be changed to 1 queen/king bed as I was staying by myself.  They said they would call me in my room and let me know if they can that night.   I never received a call. First thing Monday morning before I head to the office, I go and ask reception what they are doing about my room they say that none left any notes that I needed my room changed and they would be able to get me a new room for when I return from work at 5.  Sure enough when I return from work at 5 there is another person there and they are not aware that I awnted my romo changed. I waited at the front desk for 30 mins…"
5838,"One of those business hotels of Sao Paulo that looks exactly the same as the one next door. Cramped and old bathroom,  ok bedding, and just a depressing decor. Moreover, this particular Blue Tree was really unflexible to me with regards to early check-in or a late check-out, which I find ridiculous when you are staying several nights and that there are available rooms in the hotel. The man who did the check out for me was plain rude, but other than that the staff is courteous and efficient."
5839,"We visited the sky bar after a recommendation from a local, the view was very nice but the drinks were very overpriced, I’d understand the cocktails being priced at 8 euro, but even the tea and coffee?! "
5840,"I reserved a room with a king size bed. Upon arrival the hotel only had available a room with 2 full size beds. I was told I would be given a credit which was not received.  The room was extremely noisy both outside & inside. No extra outlets provided to plug in phones & laptops.  No place to store toiletries in the bathroom. Had to wait 5 minutes to get like warm water.  I would not recommend this hotel, extremely disappointed. "
5841,"Loud, old and small rooms, dirty and unsafe.  Windows won't lock that literally look out onto a restaurant.  A bathtub that looks like it has diarrhea or vomit.  Torn carpet, boogers on the walls, and the TV's don't go above 25 so if you have the AC on you can't listen to the TV."
5842,"Coming back after many years got a bitter surprise by the low-level that the Rio Othon Palace reached.  The rooms are showing signs of low maintenance and cleaning is not how it should be.  Service level is quite poor and the breakfast especially extremely disappointing.  Very delusional,  only thing still good is the view on the beach."
5843,"Nice hotel, very nice room, very competent and friendly staff, very good location. Points which could be improved: room was very hot, air conditioning did not work (we were told that there is actually no air conditioning, only ventilation, but that is hard to believe). Room was actually a bit noisy because people sit and talk in the garden and on balconies even very late at night and sound propagates and resonates in the courtyard. It would not be a problem if the room had not been overheated because then we could have kept the window closed, but the combination of overheating and some noise kept us awake and uncomfortable at night. This is really a shame because the hotel is great from all other points of view. The staff is not only competent but also attentive to customers and…"
5844,"This was my first and last time staying at the Radisson Vila Olimpia. I chose this hotel for location and price, but I've learned my lesson. Radisson should be ashamed to call this part of their group. The hotel needs an upgrade in the worst way. I arrive at 3 am after a late flight, and was given a room with a deafening buzz due to the air conditioning. I was told that there were no other rooms and I would have to wait until the morning to change my room. Fortunately they did, but they offered no apology or compensation for a horrible night's sleep. The shower stall was not properly sealed, so a shower resulted in flooding out the bathroom floor which was a miserable experience. I paid extra for the breakfast, which was ok at best. The area where they serve breakfast is very…"
5845,"I stayed two nights with a friend in January after spending New Years in Rio.  Travel plans had changed, and the person who booked the room (and has status with Intercontinental),  was unable to join us.  Not a problem, right?  The room was paid for with miles, but the value of those miles was over $300/night.  WRONG!  At every turn we were reminded that the person who booked the room was not there, and therefore we were not entitled to anything.  On top of that there was a constant sales pitch:  ""If you join our club we can help you with whatever you need!""  It became quite frustrating as we were reminded that we were not entitled to any executive perks, that late checkout would require a 1/2 day charge (we had already confirmed it was OK/included on the day of our arrival),…"
5846,"Easily the worst and most disgusting hotel I have ever seen. When you walk in the lobby, you are hit with an indescribable smell that combines some type of cleaning solvent, with mold, and decay. Was hoping it would get better when I got to my room, but it only got worse. A smell so bad, it wakes you up at night! Beyond that, there is really nothing nice. Very dirty, sticky bathroom floor, mold visible all over the bathroom, noisy, crappy little elevator - the list goes on! Got stuck there because a conference was in town, but I would have rather slept at a bus station. Complete nightmare!"
5847,"We stayed at the Ribeira on two different nights, separated by a week away in other parts of Portugal.  The hotel is extremely well located, directly on the waterfront square.  The water taxi and Six Bridges cruise departures are steps away, and a huge selection of restaurants and bars are right outside the door.    The front desk is efficient but not overly informative.  The will happily answer all of your questions, but rarely offer more that what you ask about directly.  They can call a cab for you as well.  Both our rooms were comfortable with good A.C, good wifi, and with windows that can open, which is a plus  The breakfast had eggs, bacon, sliced ham and cheese, fruit, breads, croissants, and juices, beginning at 7:30 am.  Our only problem with the RIbeira was that we had…"
5848,"Reception staff, who also work behind the bar and prepare breakfast, were very welcoming and helpful during our 3 night stay. Don't stay in a standard double room, which are very small and cramped.  Ask for an upgrade or pay for it if you can. The hotel is close to restaurants and the central station."
5849,What can you say about Novotel that hasn’t been said. They are functional with pleasant staff. Food here was ok with breakfast and lunch better than the dinners. Bar was busy. Just a pity Berlin was grey and wet. 
5850,"We stayed here for two nights as an end to our backpacking tour of Vietnam to celebrate my 50th with our adult kids.  The place is really a very poor average.  It's shabby, the rooms are big, but curtains and furnishings are filthy and stained.  The restauant staff are unfriendly and the food (apart from breakfast) is not good at all, we felt like we were imposing on them to be served lunch and dinner on our first night. We had adjoing rooms with our kids (who had a duplex), I complained as in the duplex, the walls had mould and were full of small flies.  They therefore ""upgraded"" our dis to a bungalow for two people, so that our 20 year old son had to sleep in a single bed at the foot of his sister & boyfriends bed !  Ther was no particular apology, just ""well we are…"
5851,"Lovely hotel, lovely quiet setting and not far from centre. Every night came back to little chocolates in room which was a nice touch. lovely bathroom products. Hotel has a happy hour but it's only for cocktails and as my partner only drinks wine we never could take advantage of happy hour, which was a pity as we were there for 5 nights. Staff very helpful & friendly. Will come back here for sure when back in Cannes 😎....loved Cannes😊"
5852,"The hotel is a good choice for those who travels on a budget.  It is located in De Pijp, not far from Canals and Museum Quarter. You can easily walk from there to Amsterdam Central in around 20 minutes.  The front desk is open 24 hours, helpful gentlemen made my check-in and check-out experiences smooth and efficient.  There is an elevator at the hotel, so you won’t need to take your luggage to the upper floor using stairs. I had a single room on a 3 floor. It was of the exactly right size for 1 person staying there for a night. High ceilings, big windows were the additional highlights. Still, don’t expect much from the design or furniture, it’s a cheap 3 star hotel. On the downsides, I would mentioned a bed - a bit too soft for me, and, what ruined an overall positive impression, cleanliness. The towels were not dry cleaned properly, and the wall in the bathroom had hairs of previous guest, plenty of them! There were also the kids from body/hair wash of the previous guest on the shelf in the bathroom.…"
5855,"dirty and usty rooms, dirty tables at breakfast, small rooms, no shelfs or racks to put things, staff does not care at all for complains, expensive parking, very good situated in Amsterdam, good to reach shops etc"
5856,"Stayed 2 nights there. Located in the Montmartre area surrounded by a lot of restaurants, shops and metro. We walked to place de tetre area one night. We also took metro to Eiffel tower which was super easy. Moulin Rouge was like 2 mins walk away. I wish I had bought a ticket to go. Free coffee/tea, croissants everyday from afternoon to evening. The room was small but it was enough for both of us. The hotel was under some renovation but there was no loud noise. It's equipped with a lot of USB plug in all over the room which was a nice bonus."
5857,"My company booked this hotel for a 4 weeks business trip in Chicago. Rooms are dirty and loud, close to the highway. The first day my perfume disappeared... The 2nd week, the laundry service burned one of my shirt. When you call the front desk, nobody answer. Staff is not professional and unpleasant.   One of my colleague ordered clothes online with delivery in the hotel. A staff member tried to stole it saying the parcel was never delivered.  The laundry service is disastrous, expensive and take 2 or 3 days to clean your clothes.   Do not go in this hotel! I don't understand why it's a Crown Plaza. Please save money and try something else..."
5858,"We have spent 2 nights in this 4 stars hotel. I would like to start saying that although it is advertised as a 4 star this hotel looks like a cheap 3 star. The only nice thing is the location of this place and that’s it. Rooms are old and dirty, we had brown water running from the shower and the breakfast was average. In conclusion, I do not recommend this hotel"
5859,"I discovered this location when I was planning our trip to Berlin. I was sure our stay in the german ""hauptstadt"" would be perfect and I must say that all days when we were coming from visit different parts of the city we felt we were returning to our own home. Thank you so much; vielen Dank."
5860,"     I really liked this hotel, in a good area of ​​Paris,great location,very close to metro,excellent staff, special thanks for my birthday present.                I hope to return to Paris, I will definitely choose this hotel again                                  "
5862,"They simply didn't let me in to the building. It was about 9:30 pm. I was kinda shocked. I was walking around, knocking at the door, finally through the window  i saw a Lady came to the front desk. she just looked at me and shaked her head. Of course I got the booking made prior to coming. Btw it's said the front desk is 24 hours."
5863,"I had to reschedule my reservation due to Hurricane Matthew. When I arrived the hotel was hard to find because the restaurant is what you see on the main street. When we arrived, they could not find my reservation. After everything was resolved, concierge would offer services for things I could have done myself. I went down for breakfast which was not included unless you had some ticket (which was cool). The beach is not on the strip you have to walk about 2 blocks then cross the street, it is homeless people around , clubs are down the street so if you are in your room you can hear the music. The walls are thin, so you can hear ppl in the hallway. And at checkout I was advised I would be charged one amount and after I checked out 3hours later, they charged my card and…"
5864,"Once again I was trapped by Mercure's name. This was a ""Mercure Apartment"" and not a ""Mercure Hotel"" which are usually good. Mercure Apartment means you get a all-in-one kitchen-living-sleeping room. This one is noisy, kind of old with stain on the bathroom door and scratched carpet. Breakfast room is creepy. Hotel location can be considered good only in case you have to business-visit in the area. Finally, I think it was expensive regarding the above mentionned."
5865,"Top location in central position of Berlin, close to railway station and Podsdamer Platz. Excellent breakfast and very friendly service. The familiy room was amazing quiet at night. We will do it again. "
5867,"Less than 10 mins on foot from Centraal Station, making it very convenient from Schipol. It's great for the major canals and Jordaan. The hotel is quite expensive but that's the location. The public areas are really nice but pretty cramped; certainly breakfast can be a bit of a traffic jam as the hotel seems to be able to accommodate more people than it can provide for when everyone wants to eat and get out for a day's sightseeing. Our room was OK but we've had far nicer at a better price in other city destinations. Chic and basic describes it pretty well. Staff were very good, and service was friendly and relaxed,"
5868,"Nice little room.  Very clean.  Good for short stay.  Bit noisy at night.  Try asking for room not facing the street.  Walking distance to everywhere with trams stop close by. Take note, there's surcharge when paying with credit card."
5869,"Very nice room in a very convenient location in the city.Beautiful bathroom, breakfast in bed, helpful staff! The room was extremely clean with a comfy bed. Great restaurants in the area and the metro staton was just a short walk away."
5871,Do not stay in even number rooms unless you want to be up until 1:00 a.m. listening to loud techno music coming from hotel outdoor nightclub.  Bathrooms are nice and bed comfortable but lack lighting and one bed is in front of a window.  Odd layout.
5872,"I stayed at this hotel attending a conference.   Overall it is a solid representation of the intercontinental line but there were a few minuses.   Pros - location.  Adjacent to the zoo and Tiergarten it is wonderfully located close to many major sites - noise.  Although this conference was massive with many attendees staying there, the room was quiet and peaceful.    -pool.  Great pool for swimming laps and a good hot tub for afterwards - sky lounge.  I found this bar late and it is a gem with good views of Berlin  Cons - bathroom.  They have a 1/2 shower in the bathtub which is not very good.  Also there was a lot of mold around the rain shower head  - sauna.  They charge an additional fee to use which should have been included.  Especially for elite members.  - bed.   For a…"
5873,"Sea view Room on 8th Floor was fine and comfortable,Spa & Pools were also good. Reception & Cleaning staff were very polite. I have never experienced such small Lifts &  frustrating Lift Control – the priority needs sorting out – on at least 3 occasions we waited while the doors opened & closed at least 4x times without the Lift moving!Pity about the Bar Staff - they were not very welcoming and basically very grumpy to the degree that I think they thought they were doing me a favour to serve! I think they are in need of desperate training on how to be happy and welcoming to guests… Very disappointed! Unfortunately we opted for half board and after our first meal regretted it! Dinner & Breakfast was very poor quality - both cooking and food choice, clearing of tables between…"
5874,"Hi everyone, Quick evaluation of this hotel based on my recent stay...  [Early check in] My flight landed early morning and I showed up few hours before check in time. Staff was very accommodating. They did spoke in Portuguese for a while prior to informing me that a room was available. [5 stars]  [Room # 1] Assigned during early check-in, had two double beds, not something I wanted, informed the front desk the moment I entered the room. They promised to change it but after seeing another room with SAFE issues did not end up getting a different room till the fourth day. [1 star]  - Cleanliness [Room # 1] - Everything was cleaned as I had expected - [5 stars] - Bathroom toiletries - [5 stars]  - Shower - Hot and Cold water flow was great along with the rain shower, just wonderful…"
5875,"Sir Adam is a nice boutique hotel in Amsterdam that has a musical vibe to it. Fancy lifts that have karaoke facilities (though you’ll never be in one long enough), a night club dance floor and crazy eye displays, you’ll never stop being entertained on the way to the room.  Other quirks include a record player in the room, a mountains worth of vinyl in reception (most of the good ones are gone though and you are left with Rod Stewart vinyls) and a worrying happiness about the staff that makes me wonder if they are hosts in Westworld.  Rooms are a little cramped for couples but look very nice – described by others as a ‘hipster’ vibe – which sounds about right. Very clean, well maintained.  There appears to be a lot going on at the hotel, rooftop bars/entertainment, nightclubs etc…"
5876,Well what a mixed bag this hotel is firstly the position is to die for we had a pool villa and we moved in went out to pool dreadful pool looked cloudy heaps of missing tiles dangerous for small kids so asked to move mind you this is very expensive for 5 days I travel worldwide and get pool rooms all the time and this was the worst pool I have ever had they moved us and this pool looked cleaner but still missing tiles and mould all around edge of pool deck was falling apart I asked after 2 days when do u clean pool they sent someone to vacuum but didn’t test water so 3rd day asked again when do chemicals go in or when you check water balance they had no idea imagine how the main pools are someone cut there foot the other day a child bleeding in to the main pool so so bad trouble…
5877,So i went there to stay i had. Brompton hotels $100 bill and on it it says only for use in brompton hotel .  the clerk said to me she didnt no what it was and. She said that i couldn't use it and when it was given to me i was told use it at any on of hotel it would be horonered.it turned out to be jibberish.
5878,"Even though we only spent one day in the hotel, we really enjoyed the service that the hotel staff provided for us. The environment and the room are also nice and clean. Will definitely recommend to my friends. "
5880,We loved hotel le royal for our first stay in Paris. It was close to the subways and easy to get around if you bought a subway pass. There were plenty of restaurants to walk to and the morning breakfast was always delicious. Would stay here again!
5881,"We actually had our city break in February 2015 but tripadvisor doesn't allow us to go further back than April !  Lisbon had the best weather forecast for any major city in Europe for that month and it turned out that way so we were lucky. It was sunny and mild but we had warm clothes just in case.  The Neya Hotel is modern, clean and efficient with all you would expect from a four-star hotel. Normally, on our first day on a city break we don't do much sightseeing, having suffered the tedium of air travel, so we tend to eat in the hotel restaurant if they have one.   We had our first night's meal in the Neya but it was to be our last. Firstly, we were told that we had to have a reservation. I was not at all happy about this and told them, somewhat forcefully, that we were…"
5883,"The food was good, but unnecessary expensive. We went there as most people do, just to say we have been there. The service was excellent, almost worth the money, very 5*****  Afternoon Tea, was  € 35. Per person."
5884,"If you are looking for rude service, small rooms and a VERY dated hotel this is the place for you.  We thought  the hotel may be a bit run down,  but booked it due to its proximity to our daughters apartment.  What a mistake....  Rather than write a book I will simply encourage all to stay away."
5885,"No I didn't get married here but stayed for 6 nights with during which 3 weddings took place...totally agree that it is a perfect location, with stunning views so great for a special day ... but if your not getting married not so great.. We arrived on our 1st evening to find the lounge and pool and area out of bounds.. On the 2nd wedding, a smaller event the lounge area was not available, the third wedding the lounge and restaurant was not available.. During these lovely events the usual attentive service provided declined, a complimentary drink was  given but I would rather have the attention to all guests than free drinks... after all my husband and I were celebrating 30 years married so it was our special event too.. "
5886,"This is a really nice small hotel in a great location in Le Marais. The area is full of interesting shops, bars and restaurants, and the hotel is well placed for Metro. The front desk will call a cab for you to the hotel. The hotel staff are friendly and helpful and speak English.We arrived at 10.30 hoping to drop our bags, to find our rooms were available, which was great.  The room was lovely, stylish, comfortable, light and airy, and well equipped. There was a little noise from the bar below the window, but the glazing is very good, and it didn’t go on too late. I understand from friends that the rooms over the street are noisier, so check when you book if this is an issue. I foundit a veryquiet hotel for a city.  Breakfast was very good, great continental selection plus hot…"
5887,"Stayed here with family for one evening prior to flying back home. This hotel is convenient to the airport -- no, you can't walk, but they do provide a shuttle and they will adjust their schedule to match yours if necessary.  Very clean, comfortable rooms, had a lovely dinner in the restaurant. Toss in some excellent service and you have a winner!!"
5889,"Arrival at 11 PM after an 8 hours flight  and I  had to wait for 30 minutes  for my luggage in the room. Security brought it finally  ""New design "" means  no desk in the room except portable desk that they can bring in the morning  Too expensive for what it is   Also do not use Booking com for this place. They send me when I was in the plane a 20 dollars additional charges for a Bathtub....  The room at the end  with NO DESK was almost 400 dollars ... And the parking fee is Extortion"
5890,"An outstanding hotel with great service and good location. Conceige service is the best i have ever seen, really! The beach is really nice with good vibes, room service food is descent, there are a room for improvement"
5891,"I highly recommend staying at the El Palace in Barcelona. The staff were courteous, friendly, professional and always tried to help. We stayed in room 311, it was beautifully decorated, spacious and clean.  The hotel is walking distance to the gay area. My domestic partner and I went on this trip to celebrate our fifteenth anniversary. Although, this is not a gay hotel, we felt welcomed and accepted.  The breakfast restaurant was a real treat with a wide variety of food choices. The service in the breakfast room was friendly, professional and classy. It was always a great way to start the day.  The blues bar in the lower level of the hotel was a nice place to unwind with a well executed classic martini.   Overall, you cannot go wrong staying at the El Palace if you plan to visit…"
5892,"I am currently staying at the Novotel and now I had to changed my room due to the poor standards of the security lock on the outside. The outside door to enter the room without a keycard just open the door and help yourself to what ever you want in my room, laptop passport, personal items etc. This was not the first time today but the 4 time in so many days. The front desk says he has not seen or heard of this and after the first time it won't happen again but the fourth time, it is now not funny or safe.  I hope the rest of my stay here is going to run smoothly. I do not think I will be staying at this hotel on my next visit.   The free wifi is poor and keeps kicking you out so you have to log in every few minutes, and it should be a 24hr pass!!!!   "
5893,"So turned up late this evening, I had emailed them to confirm this, I was worried they might give our room to someone checking in earlier...seems I was right to worry, I have a twin room that looks out onto a tree, I should have a superior double with a city view!! I've spoken with reception & they are full however they assure me that when I come down to breakfast tomorrow, I'm to come to reception & a superior double room will be waiting for me...let's see what happens, it will show clearly what kind of hotel this is. Update coming tomorrow! "
5894,"The Moxy is conviniently located 5 min from metro/train station that connects you everywhere in the city and the outskirts. It’s very contemporary and stylish and everywhere you look at looks good, everything smells new, and the nicest of all is the remarkable crew! From check in and all through, we were politely assisted by Alvaro, Lisa and Toni, and even rescued by the crew as we lost our return flight to Barcelona, they were caring of us till the last minute and showed us empathy for our situation. You guys ROCKKK and we greatly appreciate your concern, hope to see you back!"
5895,"Overall appearance - clean modern and fuctional  Staff - friendly, helpful and all speak fluent English  Breakfast - small selection of pastries and fruit (typical continental buffet) with boiled eggs cooked to order and hot and cold drinks served to table.  Room - with reliable WiFi, modern TV and nicely decorated.  I would happily book again as the value represented here is very competitive.  "
5896,"My partner and I booked 'Deluxe Double Room with Ocean View' and were upgraded to 'Villa with Garden View' upon arrival which was nice. The Receptionist staff, although super friendly, had extremely limited English and we found interaction with them a bit frustrating at times. They were pretty very good at taking our payments and organising taxi's though. The room we were upgraded to was extremely nice. Pretty big with a nice clean bathroom and balcony.   It's a great venue but it is more suited to families with kids. If you are a couple looking to get away for a relaxing trip this is not your place. There's other much better options that you'll be way more relaxed at. Dunno how long the hotel has been around for but hopefully with some more guest feedback Eden continues to…"
5898,"I stayed here back in the mid 80s when it was first opened and managed by Sheraton. Back then, this was the only internationally recognized hotel in Shanghai. Just went back and WOW, what a difference. Of course, the hotel hardware is getting old, very old. But the level of service is just awful. I would have given one star but for the location. "
5899,"As per the title of this review, the bathroom of my room (8040) was utterly disgraceful.  The bath-tub would not drain at all.  Given that I was here only to sleep at night between flights and tired from flying the past 24 hours, I did not care to report it.  The price paid for this 7-9 hour stay was not worth it.  Avoid at all cost.  This is the third time I have stayed at this hotel in 3 years and it has been terrible. JUST TERRIBLE."
5900,"Very sad to return to this hotel, it used to be my favorite but it is now tired, dirty and not well maintained. I had to ask to change room once, and despite being booked into ""executive"" level, the room is still not clean. The carpet is stained, the bathroom not clean, etc etc. I dread to think what level the ""standard"" rooms are.  If the hotel was cheap I could accept the poor level, but we are paying £200 a night! "
5902,"This was my first time in this hotel. The location is good in Jin An area near 3 subway lines. I used to stay at the Okura hotel nearby n I loved it. This time with my wife to try out the Four Season for its high ranking plus its supposed to be a five star hotel. I book the hotel thru Trip Advisor.  The room that I was given #2115 was not bad, little out dated in the bath room. The view is ok. Room is quiet. But the internet was little choppy, sometimes around 11pm, it’s not working, may be too many ppl online at that time. The staffs are helpful, n I liked the indoor swimming pool but hotel does not offer free swimming caps so need to buy one on my trip. The breakfast buffet is great n seating is comfy. But when we were having breakfast on Saturday morning 11/23, all of sudden…"
5903,"We had a very pleasant stay at the Hotel Apollonia Montparnasse. The hotel staff was extremely pleasant, welcoming, and always willing to help with dinner suggestions, taxi reservations, subway directions, or anything we may need. The room was small, but lovely and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The neighborhood is charming with easy subway access and several great restaurants within walking distance. I would not hesitate to stay again and would recommend to anyone visiting Paris!"
5904,"we arrived on 13th Feb, such a lovely friendly hotel with very friendly staff. The rooms are very tidy and clean with a nespresso maker. The staff at Hotel Max was so friendly and helpful when it came to needing directions to different places and metro stations. We had a breakfast one morning in the hotel and it was beautiful. The only thing we found difficult was somewhere for eating out. Our trip was made extra special as we got engaged at Hotel Max! Leaving with happy memories! Would deffinitley come back and stay at Hotel Max again!! :)"
5905,"This is not a review of the property or room itself, but of the hotel's communications and policy.  Despite making a reservation well in advance, I never received any confirmation or communications from the hotel.  When I tried to modify my existing reservation, they could not find my booking without a reservation number, which I never received since they did not send a follow-up or confirmation email with the details of my reservation.  There was no communication until this email asking me to review my stay; no receipt, no indication that they had charged my card for being a ""no show,"" no 24-hour notice expressing that they would be looking forward to my stay.  Complete silence, and an exorbitant charge, despite providing me no means of cancelling or checking my reservation. …"
5906,"We stayed for four nights while on holiday in Berlin. The hotel is very central, walkable to most attractions, and staff were friendly. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom had a strange red light, which I assumed was a heater(?). The air conditioning is loud if you are a light-medium sleeper, and the window barely opens so the room becomes stuffy. We didn’t have breakfast included. Three elevators are available and we didn’t have a issue with over crowding on them. The room has a little fridge which was great.   I’d stay again! "
5907,"The best thing I can say is that the hotel is centrally located. The rooms are small, no drawers for storage, housekeeping doesn’t come till late in the day, the room keys didn’t work and had to be rekeyed 4 times, we asked 4 times to have the TV checked because there are no channels in English and no one ever responded. Would not stay here again. "
5908,"We stayed in the Honeymoon suite for 2 nights. The view was amazing, but I guess that was all with that hotel. This is by far no luxury hotel (although the price you pay is for at least 5star hotel). The room (by no means a suite!!) was average. The bathroom however was not decent. There was only a shower (not bathtube) and besides the wierd odour it was not very clean. I had to shower wearing my slippers. The bed was of a fairly good size, but the bed sheets were not (they were too small to fit for the size of the bed). Breakfast was a poor continental one and yogurt was kept outside the fridge or somethinfg to preserve it cool.The most negative point of this hotel is that there was no swimming pool. This is really a problem, because jacuzzi is not a pool!!! In addition, the…"
5909,"Great place for a short stay. The main advantage is location almost in city center (5min Potsdamer Platz, 10min Brandenburger Tor). The closest subway station is only 150m from hotel. The wifi connection was excellent. I can also recommend the breakfast.       "
5911,Excellent location but rooms looking to the street are very noisy. Room was small and clean except the footprints on the wall. I contacted the hotel both by e-mail and phone. First they did not answer for ten days and when I called them I could not get what I needed any more. I sent a new mail and no answer again. Stuff was too busy perhaps to deal with guests. Nor did they say goodbye when leaving.
5912,We very much enjoyed our stay. Front desk staff are all very helpful. Views from the room over the Bassin de la Villette are great. The room was extremely comfortable with nice linens and towels. Only room negative was the lack of adequate lighting. Very hard to read in bed after dark. Breakfast was excellent with a variety of fresh hot and cold items. The location is in an area becoming more upscale but not convenient to most tourist sights. The restaurant located in the hotel but not part of the hotel has a great waterfront view with good food but unpleasant service.
5913,"I attended a medical conference in December 2015. The conference venue was the The Shelborne Wyndham Grand Hotel. As this hotel was already fully booked, I opted to book my 6 day stay at The Redbury Hotel which was across the road.  All reviews have been great about The Redbury Hotel but I want for you dear reader to to decide for yourself if what happened to me was a simple case that could be forgotten cause this could happen to you.  Everything went well until my last conference day. I checked out before 7 am just so I do not have to rush back to do so before my conference ended.  I entrusted my luggage to the hotel's front desk. I had all my valuables in there as my idea was if I had to bring those at the conference venue, there would be an even greater risk of misplacing or…"
5915,"Had a frustration with hotel staff (front desk) who were unable to solve basic issues. Checking in and out was a nightmare - massively over crowded, took 20 minutes to get to reception on the second floor via the lifts. Check out was even more frustrating. I think the hotel was fully booked and unable to cope with the volume of people. Might have been different if i was the bride or groom of a wedding party... Not a good place for a business stay, expensive and over the top for holidays despite reasonable location and sporting gimmicks."
5916,This hotel was too far to walk into Funchal but did have shuttle bus. It was 30 mins one way along promenade to fishing village( nicest on the island) with decent supermarket and 30 mins the other way to good selection of restaurants  and shopping with big supermarket at forum shopping centre. It did have 3 restaurants along sea front 5 -10 mins.  The hotel was clean and had nice home cooked breakfasts simple choice but fresh. For anyone with mobility issues pool and promenade a good steep walk with steps. Beautiful views of sea from all rooms but budget rooms did not have big balcony with jet 2. We hired a car using hotel for 2 days and covered most of the island great advice from the company were to go and good vehicles. Alternative seemed the yellow bus sightseeing company…
5917,"This hotel is nothing short of AMAZING! From the minute we arrived at the hotel - we were welcomed by friendly Concierge staff who assisted us with our luggage. We were offered a refreshing welcome drink Cava (Spanish sparkling wine) upon our arrival. Although our room was not ready when we arrived, we sat in the Lobby area which was very comfortable and cosy. There is a stunning bar as well, with a wide variety of wines and gins as well.  The location of the hotel is also really great, walking distance to almost all the tourist attractions and the main shopping districts. We stayed at the hotel for 7 days - the reception staff were very friendly and helpful, especially offering us tips and recommend places for us to go see or eat. We stayed in the Design Deluxe room - it was…"
5918,"Our family booked 3 rooms for 4 nights. Unfortunately, the rudeness of the person at check in set the mood for our stay, i.e. it left a sour taste and we avoided the reception area unless it was unavoidable.   Breakfast was hit and miss with limited options.  There were no glasses provided, only styrofoam cups.  Not sure why they bothered with the gym upgrade as it is postage stamp size with no personal space if there is another person using it.    I've visited Waikiki three times but will not be returning to this place."
5919,Business class room was given to me but room size was too small as per category. I found cockroaches in bathroom. Even at time of bathing water was coming like drop by drop from shower. No body was ready to pick up the phone in housekeeping. Overall bad experience
5920,"My 2 nights here was fantastic. As expected top notch hotel room facilities. My room view was partly facing the train station and Bikini Berlin shopping mall...Branded luxury bathroom utilities. Breakfast was excellent. something to look forward every morning, beside the buffet spread you could order some a la carte dish and delivered to your seating place. Strategic location, train station just across the street, shopping malls along the road. and many restaurants and bars behind hotel.  Enjoyed my stay here. Keep it up Waldorf."
5921,"We were in Berlin for the Berlin Marathon and wanted to stay somewhere with some cooking facilities but also comfortable prior to the race.  We loved our stay.  Clean room, fridge, 2-burner stove, utensils, pots, etc.  We also had a balcony and full television channel options.  Centrally located near the train station and trams too.  The restaurant was decent and we ordered room service too! Highly recommend the room service breakfast deal.  "
5923,"Dont go there when you are OLD . Thats Lisbon , going up and going down for change stairs , 100 stairs up 300 down and again . Hotel is nicely located but no views from the window , old ugly bildings , difficult to find a parking place , Police hunting to block a car - it happend to me 95 Euro because you are a foreigner to pay cash !!!! Be careful going to the restaurant .One day we payed 35 Euro , Day after 145 Euro for nearly the same . Not even one Fado Place with live music. BUT absolutely great people at the hotel desk , untill the 3erd day at the breakfast we met a new guy working there , I was sure it was candid camera or Monty python - more than 1 hour to get something - anything to eat and not what we asked for ."
5924,"I have stayed at this hotel on business numerous times over the past 20 years.  This was a seven day vacation.  The bottoms line - world class prices, third world service.  And a General Manager of a single property hotel who was either too important, busy or absent to even respond to a request for a meeting. I arrived early and the first thing the desk clerk wanted to do was upswell me to a suite - another $150 per night.  I accepted - my room was not ready and wouldn't be ready for a considerable time despite my reservation through American Express Fine Hotels that guarantees early checkin by noon and late checkout by 4 pm. Ad from there the stay went downhill.  Principally because the staff, well nice and pleasant are either language challenged or simply indifferent to your…"
5925,"On arrival myself & my girlfriend was greeted by a lady & gentlemen (spencer & Natasha ) They where pleasant & helpful they even offered us an upgrade from our original booking( thanks).  When we entered the room there was coffee stains on the dressing table, make up of some kind on the pillow case & red marks in the bath tub.   Since this trip was a birthday surprises was disappointed with the managers comments & attitude on the situation when I made a complaint.  After some time telling the manager how disgusted we where about the situation. It's only COMMON sense you offer another room to a guest.   Continuing on We was then told by reception to get our belongings and come to reception in order to move rooms. At this point my partner was half dressed & had to put her coat on…"
5927,"Visited in a group of four and online this felt like the perfect apartment!  We arrived at the check in (which is about a 10 minute walk from the apartment) the check in area is tiny, the ""lobby"" only seats four, has nowhere which I would deem as ""secure"" but more of a communal space for luggage and no toilets - you have to take a short walk to the staff room toilet.  There is a very neglected coffee machine for self use.  The apartment wasn't perfectly clean, huge amounts of dust under the beds which I wouldn't expect.  The apartment doesn't have a phone and you don't get left with a contact number for the main reception - we did have queries but nobody to ask!  The rooms of the apartments are paper thin which is not good as you have people below and above you as well as…"
5928,Very nice boutique hotel in Barcelona. Close to great shopping and good Restaurants. Nice rooftop pool.  Rooms are small. Free Wi-Fi. Not cheap but Barcelona is generally not a cheap place. Modern rooms
5929,"Very good location, good service and good price. The staff was always nice with us, the room was very clean and beatiful, in a good area, make our visit to Paris even more beautiful and plesent. Thank you"
5930,"This was a very pleasant and beuatiful stay.  The prices were reasonable, the room was with a great view, and the pool/workout area was ideal with my stay for a family wedding.  The staff's customer service was ""A+++"".  The staff was gunuinely concerned for my stay and my experience with Hyatt, and the location was ideal for Chicago. I was most pleasantly suprised with the accomodations and would come back for any future visits in Chicago."
5931,"The food in the restaurant was of very good quality, well cooked and served with a smile. The bar service was equally good. Reception less so. The air conditioning on the first night did not work and the room was stifling. The person on reception was dismissive of the problem before moving us to another room which took most of the morning. The tourist information at reception was also poor. The servicing of the public toilets was inadequate, cleaning indifferent and hand towels not replenished. We liked the hotel itself, the rooms and its location convenient for the city centre."
5932,"Decided to stay here on a last minute break as we found it on Expedia where it was highly rated.  The hotel is located a ten minute drive from the centre of Lisbon, in an area of predominantly high rise flats and some semi industrial, this however is not a problem as access to the centre of Lisbon is made easy by cheap and plentiful taxis as well as and its close proximity to the rail station.  First impressions were excellent with an impressive reception and friendly efficient staff. The room was very good with all the expected extras for a hotel like this.  A few gripes however. Breakfast is utter chaos. A large buffet style breakfast with everything you can imagine on offer but frankly it's a free for all melée and general carnage ensues. Staff look stressed and you are lucky…"
5933,"Wow! So for over $200 a night we expected a nice stay in an older yet elegant hotel right in downtown Chicago. The lobby is nice, bar is pretty neat and entrance and hotel itself on the outside is wonderful. First step in the elevator and we saw stains, not sure what they were and we certainly did not want to know, the musty smells were very off putting as well. Finally get up to our room and after entering and turning on the lights I told my husband I think we entered a time warp and entered a room at the Bates Motel! The room itself was so old and outdated and just plain nasty! A 70's style, porn movie worthy, padded velour headboard that had some questionable areas on it greeted us on the bed. I looked up to see a popcorn ceiling with water stains all over it. The bathroom…"
5934,"This hotel was booked as it was a reasonable price and fairly close to the city centre as well as being a trusted name in best western. The hotel is not bad, it has a nice clean bright lobby and friendly staff who issued us with a map showing us how to use the public transport to get into the city centre. The rooms were clean and had a good bathroom. It was in a good location in terms of public transport only a few min walk to both tram and bus stop stops. All in all I would recommend anyone to stay here it is basic but perfectly acceptable for a long weekend away. "
5935,"From start to finish, staying at this hotel was my worst stay EVER at a Hilton hotel.  I shared my frustrations and NOTHING was done by anyone at the hotel (Staff or GM).  Restaurant on site was lacking, service was lacking and the room was dirty, smelled like urine and my entire family came home sick from bad air conditioning in the room.  HORRIBLE experience even as a gold member."
5937,I had the room no more than 30 min I call the front desk and told them I had an emergency I had to leave will I be able to get a refund she said I was nothing they could do about it so I just waited on my ride and left I don't think that's right I didn't stay the night 
5938,"Fred Hotel was reasonably priced, clean, and friendly.  The staff was multi-lingual and very helpful. They went above and beyond to take care of us--and new us on sight from day one.  Rooms are not large, but clean, comfortable, and functional.  Parking is non-existent, so be prepared to fight for Paris street parking if needed."
5940,"One week for a trip for working.  The hotel is good, but it's terrible to get a taxi. Every day taxi drivers who are close to the hotel refuse to take us.  They asked if we want to go to the airport and otherwise, they refused......  And when we ask the guy from the hotel to get a taxi he used a computer but no taxi came.  Today, we wait 45mn and finaly no taxi"
5941,Stayed here for two nights for a stag party. Great restaurants and bars nearby and great transportation links within walking distance from the hotel. Would definitely return with my wife and or kids as this hotel is very quiet and beat suited to couples and small families for short stays in my opinion. 
5942,"We stayed at the Waldorf Astoria for one evening to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary in Chicago.  The Waldorf certainly made this an anniversary we'll remember.  We booked through AMEX Fine Resorts and Hotels.  We chose the Waldorf over the Peninsula (where we've stayed before) since AMEX informed us that the Peninsula was under renovation.  Since we were only staying one evening, we wanted to be assured of a pleasant stay.  Upon check-in, there is a sign that alerts you to the fact they have construction as well.  The person at check in informed us that we were high enough up to avoid most of the noise.  Not close.  Hammer drilling that was either on our floor or the floor above made it difficult to make a phone call.  The fire detector went off numerous times in our…"
5943,"We have been here for the last 3 nights. It’s 2 years old cosy boutique hotel. The staff is very polite, speaking good english. The rooms are very tiny, but efficient. The Nesspresso coffee machine is great. The refrigerator is full of free products. We’ll be back to this hotel."
5944,"Where do I begin?  Short Review: I stayed at the Shore Club last year and had a good  experience. This time it is was almost the complete opposite.   - Only the valet and front desk staff are pleasant.  99% of the beach and pool staff are rude and stand around chatting and ignoring guests.  (We heard this complaint repeated by multiple guest while there. It was a big topic of conversation in the pool.)  - No one seems to know what is going on.  I had an issue with company policies and needed a refund for a double payment. I spent almost 2 weeks waiting for refunds,  spending hours being transferred around, and explaining the full story everytime. (Notations apparently weren't detailed enough.)    - Room furnishings and decor are worn and a bit weathered. The room doorways do not…"
5946,"This was the first venue we stayed in during our vacation to Santorini. We were disappointed and when we moved to our second venue (which was half the price!) our disappointment grew by the minute. We found the service average, the place (and bathroom) musky and dirty to the point that we did not want to use the whirlpool nor walk in our apartment barefoot. We will for sure not stay here again. The breakfast was good and the view spectacular (hence 3 starts vs. 2) but truly this is where our enjoyment ended. I do not recommend staying here when there are so many other, more affordable options on the island that offers a similar view and breakfast however with much better amenities."
5947,"Stayed at this hotel Oct 2018, it was called Intercontinental Chongqin back at that time. My stay had a bad start. When I checked in, the staff told me that they have no room of kingsize bed i booked with non-smoking. They offered me a smoking room. It is quite surprising. They even had smoking room in 2018 in such a modern city in china. I rejected them. It took them quite some time to upgrade me a room with kingsize bed room. The room is large but very dated. Everything in the room felt wet and the room smells bad. furniture were very old and not well maintained.  The lock of the room was not working well. Had to insert my key card multiple times to open it. I did call the lobby staff to help to open the door once. They have 3 elevators. Maybe they are too old. It was very…"
5949,"I stayed here for a few nights in October. I was drawn to it because of the reviews and the promises on the website. Unfortunately, it was average and nothing to write home about. Location is good and convenient but not outstanding. The breakfast was the same day after day - need to mix it up a bit. The room was modern, with more design than practicality in mind. Cleanliness was good. Front desk service was a bit inconsistent. There are staff members who are genuinely helpful and then there are some. I tried to break a 100 bill and the lady twice counted (with 20's) 1 - 2 -3 -5. Uhm, that's only 80! Luckily, her colleague was there to catch it too."
5950,"The Hotel I think could be better and could get 4 or 5 stars if the decor was updated and the standard rooms are re named as basic. The food is ok , better in the evening than day(Idid get food poisoning from somewhere maybe not the Hotel) . The bus serves is close by and very good value and one of the drivers Bruno was very good helping people and us !! It has a lot of mirrors in the Hotel and most of the staff are helpful . Should have told them about the hard beds!"
5951,"My girlfriend and I were attending a conference and stayed at the Warwick Hotel in San Francisco for 3 nights.  There was a really bad smell upon entering the room.  Furthermore, there was a pizza box with food and grease residue left in one of the drawers, and stains on the drawer.  The bathroom floor was very sticky and the towels looked very old, and a white stain was found on the duvet.  We went to the reception desk and mentioned about the smell of the room and the pizza box that was probably left in there by the previous guess and never removed during cleaning.  They sent someone to the room to take picture of the pizza box who looked pretty shocked that at the sight of the box in the drawer.  The following day, the bad smell in the room was addressed; however, the pizza…"
5953,I booked a hotel through Hotwire and was given this one. I selected a hotel with at least a 3.5 star rating. Rooms in this hotel may indeed rate that high but my room sure wasn't a 3.5. Here's why: The room was so small I had to turn sidewise around the back of the bed to get from one side of the room to the other. The main body of the room was 8.5' by 12'. This doesn't count the tiny desk alcove and the bathroom. The air conditioning unit was in the window and noisy. The bed was so low to the ground that when looking at the TV attached high on the wall I had to crane my neck. TV was terrible. Not HD. The picture was so stretched to fill the screen that it was way too pixelated. No lounging chair in the room. Very limited shelf space in the room. Virtually no counter space in…
5955,"Seems to be a hotel where many of the guests are staying for business purposes, which makes sense since it is not located closely to the main tourist areas in Porto.  Wonderful, open lobby, with glass elevators to take guests to their floors.  Rooms were a bit on the darker side, but spacious by European standards.  Overall, we had a nice stay."
5956,"We had a bad experience here overall. The room was fine but the service was poor compared to other Four Seasons we have stayed at. From the unhelpful valet to the grumpy bar manager, I would not recommend a stay for those intereste din a luxury hotel."
5957,"My husband and I stayed here five nights and were so glad we did! The room was plenty big enough, the staff was very helpful and accommodating, the breakfast was just fine (given what it would have cost us outside the hotel, it was great!), and the location, just a short walk to Place Republic (a main underground hub) was wonderful! And yet, it wasn't a noisy location. Just a very short walk away were many cafes, restaurants, a number of good groceries, and even a laundry. We will deficiently stay here again that next time we're in Paris!"
5958,"So if you are looking for a centrally located hotel in Paris at a reasonable price, this is a very good choice.  It is located on a quiet street but has easy access to the metro and Louvre.  Rooms are small but very up to date and extremely comfortable.  Nice breakfast is also available.  The staff is very attentive to any questions or concerns."
5959,"Very good location, nice breakfast, clean and quiet rooms, everything was excellent. The hotel was different in a positive way: graffitis on the walls, interesting bathrooms and so on. Garage was very tiny but we appreciated the reservation that hotel made for us!              "
5960,"We stayed At Six for 3 nights in August, the location was central and the overall hotel presentation is chic and stylish. The hotel restaurant was excellent with modern European food at dinner and a good selection at breakfast and the staff were overall welcoming. On the downside, as it was relatively warm the weekend we stayed in Stockholm, our room was stuffy and uncomfortable at night to sleep. If you are overlooking the next door rooftop bar, the music is also pretty loud until 12/1am on a Saturday. Probably best for younger couples looking for a party atmosphere and in the cooler Autumn/Winter weather. "
5961,"Firstly the staff at reception that o dealt with where lovely! However had zero knowledge on the tram services when I enquired .   Checked in to a 4 dorm. After 5 minutes i was requesting to be moved . Corridors smell awful, the first shared room was dirty (current occupants had really made themselves at home) moved to a private ensuite room, which was ok. NO HOT WATER it's coming into winter, There is barely warm water from the showers and light bedding on the beds.  From location to use the team system you still have to walk far down the street. Kitchen equipment also dirty and faulty. "
5962,"After a week on a Viking River cruise,  which was really a class act and first class all the way,  I looked forward to spending two days in Amsterdam. I booked this hotel believing it to be approximately 5 to 10 minutes from the center of Amsterdam.  When I arrived, it was not what I expected. The room left something to be desired. It was not  what I would've expected of a Hilton hotel. There was a small closet and no drawers to put your clothes in. Since I was only there for two days, it didn't matter but it could have been very inconvenient for a longer period of time to live out of a suitcase.  Also, while the bathroom was adequate in size, there was only one sink and no counter space to put your things on. The shower floor was quite slippery and there was no rubber bathmat…"
5963,"The location of this hotel is superb, very central and close to everything Funchal has to offer. However as a 3* hotel the facilities are definitely lacking. The rooms are basic and most seem to look out onto brick walls except a few at the front with balconies although even these look onto the street and office/apartment buildings. The room I was allocated was noisy with constant noise from fans/generators which seemed to be coming from outside. Not conducive for a good night's rest.  The hotel does not have any comfortable seating/relaxing areas and no bar in the main area so nowhere to sit/meet  with a drink before or after one's evening excursions. There is a large rooftop terrace area with terrific views and here there is a bar but it was never open! Again, on this terrace,…"
5964,"I stayed 3nights during december 2017.  Pros: - Amazing breakfast. They have so many options! Fruits, juices, types of bread, croissant, pho, eggs, lots of cheese, salad, rice, meat. Everything - Lovely room. Super new, private and  good decoration. - You can do kayak and snorkeling inside the resort for free. I love it. - Restaurant food is ok. - Free water everyday. Free fruit in the first day. - Manager was super nice and let us do a late check out at 2pm.  Cons: - Hot tub inside the room wasn't working because they didn't had enough hot water. Such a huge disappointement. I choose this particular resort because of the hot tub inside the room. I wonder how a resort doesn't have enough hot water. We talked to the manager and he said that the heather wasn't big enough and we…"
5965,In an excellent location. High quality small friendly hotel. Gets all the basics right. Great breakfast. Comfortable rooms and beds. Staff most helpful. Maison Bess restaurant withing 200m is simple superb french cooking.
5967,"My friend and I stayed here earlier this month, and we would definitely stay here again when visiting Barcelona.  The apartments are new, beautiful, spacious, and very clean.  They look just like the photographs on their website.  We felt they had all the necessities (e.g. air conditioning, iron and ironing board, laundry service). We were also very happy with the location, being very close to the Sants Station, it was easy to get to from the airport and many tourist sites with the train and metro.  (Their site gave great directions to get to the hotel from the airport.)  If you are looking for a 4-star experience (such as the reviewer below), this is probably not the place for you (My friend and I didn't need new sheets every night).  The mattresses were also relatively thin,…"
5968,"I travel a lot to San Francisco for business travel and on this occassion it was a one night stay.  The 1st room I checked in to smelled like urine and the chemicals to clean it was so  overwhelmning so they put me in a different room which smelled fine,  The room is incredibly small and cramped which is not unusual for SF in general.    The biggest problem was there was no running hot water for a shower the following morning and I paid $349 for this room which I would assume is part of the $349.  I called down to the front desk to ask how do I get hot water and they said you need to let it run for a while so I did.  After 20 minutes it was colder than when I started so I took a sponge bath like all the homeless people do in the area.  I only had 30 minutes to get to the office…"
5969,"This hotel was just a short walk away from the Eiffel Tower and the Seine! The hotel itself was very clean, and both of the staff members I interacted with were very helpful. Just be aware that the elevator is very small, so you may need to take multiple trips if you have more than one suitcase with you. I would definitely stay again!"
5970,"I been staying here quite a few times, and I have to say the quality of room service is not acceptable for a Meridien hotel. First, good luck with the staff who takes your order: they are simply RUDE. Then check twice your order: they always change or forget 1 or 2 items. Today, eggs are not cooked, the fruit yogourt I asked for was a plain one, plus no spoon to use for coffee or yugourt. The room service waitress can not speak a word of english. "
5971,I know it's a city and these things happen but seriously...  I stuck my hand in my purse to get a pen and a bug crawled up my arm. I killed 3 roaches in total that nice  Needless to say I didn't sleep much. The next day I let the front desk know and they graciously offered to have someone clean my room. It was clean to begin with. Beside the bugs and the lack of response to the bugs the hotel it's self was very nice. Good location. Nice rooms.   Hotel Restaurant so so.
5972,My daughter and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights at the end of May 2019. Prior to our arrival they were very responsive to questions and the check-in process was super easy. We loved our little room on the 4th floor. The bed was comfortable and we loved the quirky designs. The location is great - close to the Louvre and a metro station and there are several dining options immediately around the hotel.   During our stay the staff members were cheery and helpful. It was a lovely place and we will definitely stay here on our next opportunity to visit Paris.
5973,"We checked in early on Friday.  We were so thankful for Lynn's warm welcome at the front.  We got there a bit early and were thrilled that we were able to check in early.  With our reservation that we made on Marriott's website, we were to receive free breakfast and a bottle of champagne.  We asked Lynn about the champagne and she said she was looking into it.  From what I gathered, they had no idea about what was included. We were told that there was free transportation to the beach.  We called the number for pickup.  The driver said it would be about 10-15 min....after waiting 20 min, I text him.  He was having mechanical problems.  We chose to use Uber instead.  On first walking into the property, I noticed that the carpet in the front was soiled and in bad shape.  I was…"
5974,bad management.... i am not talking about the house maids they service was good but the high level management are mean....they try to charge for everything...
5975,"We were a family of six, my mom, husband and three kids. We had a bungalow with our own pool, which was nice.   We were not able to stay shorter that 7 nights, (therefore more luggage) and then in the bungalow there is just a tiny closet to put your clots in. which means the room looks like a mess because you can not unpack.  To be such an expensive and fancy hotel resort they were not even able to serve a dinner within two hours. And the cost for that very late dinner is at least ten times the price from a fast , well working well tasting Vietnamese restaurant.   I would not recommend this place, to expensive, in Mui Ne you will find resorts to a better price and probably better service.  "
5976,"I've been a big fan of fours seasons resorts at their different locations around the world so I was very disappointed about my reservation experience at Ko Olina. I usually book my rooms through the portal, booking.com, and I saw that they had a cancellable room that I wanted to book for two days.   Having booked many rooms the same way through the same booking portal, I booked this room the same using my card on file which was a foreign non-US denominated credit card as I am a visitor from Asia. At the time of booking, I did not see any message that the hotel would charge me in full as a sort of guarantee for my stay. I thought the room was a 100% cancellable room like many of the other rooms I had booked on that website in the past year. I did not fathom that Four Seasons Ko…"
5977,"This hotel is run down, my room didn't appear to be clean...wipe marks on everything, the shower didn't drain at all, even after I messed with the plug a bit. I was leery that the sheets had been changed, because they didn't seem crisp at all. Bed mattress had no shape.   When I checked out, I looked to see if I had put water in the fridge. Nope, but the guest before me had left pizza in it and it wasn't cleaned out. GROSS. Never again..."
5978,"This Hilton has shocked me. Upon arrival, well after check-in time, our rooms were not clean and were told we'd have to wait over an hour for them; not something you'd want to hear after an 11 hour flight and after you called to make sure the rooms were ready. It wasn't until my husband complained to management that they accommodated us 2 nicer rooms. The only problem was that in the 3 rooms that we were given there were dead roaches. It definitely makes you question the cleaniness of the hotel. Had it not been for the excellent management staff, we would've demanded a refund. "
5979,"The hotel is located in a nice but not very central area.  Architecturally it is rather unimpressive. My room was clean but rather small, while the bed was very comfortable. The wifi was good, the price reasonable, the staff friendly and helpful and the breakfast excellent.  All in all a quite good experience."
5981,"Was really looking forward to our stay here but it unfortunately feel short of our standards overall. Location is pretty good, easy walk from metro and also a long but doable walk to the centre. We booked the deluxe room with private balcony and this is what made our stay - balcony was such a nice place to sit and relax in the evening.  I don’t think we’d have liked the hotel without this. The room itself looks great but unfortunately is mainly style over substance. Hangers in wardrobe are super high up and only just usable. Toilet door is glass and doesn’t shut properly, not pleasant experience when sharing room. Bath and shower is in the middle of the room so no privacy afforded. This is fine for the colour changing bath but not suitable for a shower. Function on bath and…"
5982,"What wonderful receptionists, were so helpful! Especially Natalie.  We initially had checked in to another small and affordable hotel but the rooms were terrible and we weren't happy. The price was right for the splendid so we moved their instead and were is pleasantly surprised by how SPLENDID it was!  Thank you! "
5983,"I got the weirdest room with only one window, placed rather high, so it really felt like an English basement. I went to ask for a change and they said no because I had purchased the room through a discount app. Never again setting foot on this nightmare of an overpriced hotel. There is no coffee maker in the rooms so one of the mornings  I asked for a small pot of black coffee delivered to the room. With delivery charges and mandatory tips it ended up being a $19 cup of coffee. You are kidding me, right? Location is central, but place is very noisy. Not recommended under any circumstances. I will not be a guest again at the Zelos Hotel San Francisco. For some reason, the app does not like my review. It keeps asking for it to be 200 plus characters (which it is)."
5986,"Came to this ""high end"" conference expecting to he wowed.  Instead, was lodged at the Westin St Francis in what must be a third rate room with no dresser, no desk, no fridge, no safe.  Had to call to have them bring us hangers for our clothes, fridge for our insulin, and internet does not work.  Further  was promised our room would be ready within the hour, but had to wait 3 hours, getting it at 4:30PM.  Not impressed.  Stayed in lower rated hotels that treated us better."
5987,"The water pressure and temperature for the shower  was the worst I've ever experienced in a hotel stay. There was no cold water, only hot and hotter and it came out with less pressure than a watering can. The pool looked refreshing but was 104 degrees. You could also hear every conversation in the rooms next door.Very thin walls. I would never stay at The Richmond again!"
5988,"We booked the hotel through HotWire since it was listed as a 4 star hotel. Don't be fooled! The rooms are tiny, the beds are hard, the bathroom was awful, no closet space, not even a complimentary water bottle. The staff was unattentive and simply did not care about accomodating you. They messed up my room service order and the tablets they have in the rooms so you can place food orders seem to be there just for decoration since the staff does not even pay attention to them and we had to call everytime we placed an order to make sure they saw it. It is way too expensive for what you get in return and would never go back or recommend it to anyone. The only nice thing about this hotel is the small bar. "
5990,"I feel badly reviewing a property before I have successfully checked in / stayed there, but I feel compelled to do so due to my terrible check in experience.  I checked in before 2, and was told my room was almost ready, I asked to be accommodated in a different room, but was told they only had terrible rooms available in the old building, unrenovated, and that my room was an excellent room.  I checked back again and again and always got the same unhelpful and untruthful ""almost read"" answer.  they guarantee that all rooms will be ready by 4, but here it is 3:50 and still no room.  I have been sitting in the lobby for two hours, how can it be possible that no accommodation can be made, how could they not send someone to clean my room in the course of the last two hours?  How…"
5991,"I loved staying at The Weinmeister. I had high expectations, and The Weinmeister didn't disappoint.  The staff were super-friendly and the room was equally comfortable. Location is perfect. I will definitely stay at The Weinmeister again."
5992,"Stayed here for two nights during a month trip of Vietnam and Cambodia and it was the worst place. Do not understand the rave reviews. Not sure if I didn't like Hue because of the hotel or vice versa but wouldn't be going back to either! Hotel was cheap and staff are friendly and helpful, but they are the only positives. Walls are paper thin, could hear full conversation and toilet activity from next door. Bed clothes were dirty, hadn't been changed from previous guest (rubbish in the bed), as we checked in late, night staff suggested we wait until morning to sort it out. Eventually we got a different room, bathroom window was broken so bugs came in and we got bitten, not sure from what. Hotel & Spa interior is pretty grim like a Soviet office block with harsh strip lighting,…"
5993,The best breakfast I have enjoyed in a very long time. In fact I have never seen the extent and variety before. Serving perfect eggs benedict as part of buffet breakfast takes courage and it did not dissapoint. The variety caters for every taste and the focus on childrens preferences was heart warming. Service and staff very friendly. Would have liked the airconditioning a bit cooler but centralised and you can only adjust the fan.
5995,"Great location if you are arriving or departing on a riverboat....but too far away from the action. Reception staff great Waiters untrained and poor service..ie delivering wrong food to our table....after we ate some he took the plate to the right table!!!!   Bottle of wine delivered to table and he did not pour it into the glasses,then stuffed up the food. However the food here is excellent, the breakfast is also great. Bathroom badly designed...to have a good shower you flood the bathroom floor, also it is dangerous getting in and out of the shower. Tv sticking out from the wall, a simple hinge bracket would fix this, also tv channels are incorrectly set..ie car repair programme on the animal channel Fair sized balcony that you cannot get to Ugly phallic columns in the foyer…"
5996,"my room was decorated when my great great grandfather was still young. this hotel is in desperate need of a renovation. bathroom is very small, nothing special which would justify 4 star rating. by today's standard somewhere between 2 and 3 stars. it's horrible and I am stuck here for 2 days..."
5997,"The location of the hotel is excellent.  You can walk to the airport.  It became necessary as there is only a small van for airport transportation that is shared with the hotel next door.  The wait for space in the van in the morning can be very long.  So beware if you have more luggage than you can handle for the walk on the cobblestone streets, and requiring crossing multiple traffic lights. Breakfast was adequate.  Wi-Fi signal in the room was great. Room is the smallest I have seen in my travels.  There is barely enough space in the bathroom to accommodate a narrow sink and flip open the tiny trash can.  The chair cannot fit into the space between the table and the bed."
5998,I stayed here for two nights on a business trip. Check in was odd because the reception area is cramped and is in a L shape so I queued one side then staff came out to serve the other side! So I waited whilst other people arriving later were checked in! My room was pleasant and clean with free wi fi. It faced another block so my net curtains mostly stayed shut. The shower was one that had two nozzles and required trial and error to operate( never any instructions!) where is hot? Where is cold? Which shower head?  Breakfast was okay a pretty basic selection but good enough with some nice fresh juices in a fridge.  This a reasonable business hotel. I saw the Exec lounge which looked good. It's not really close to tourist attractions though. I probably would not rush back if I…
5999,"The hotel is beautiful. I love the art in the lobby, in the room, on the floors. The furniture is stylish and warm. The breakfast was excellent and the bar (food and drink) was excellent. I found the welcome and the whole staff very cold and not very friendly though."
6001, It was very frustrating to come to your property and try to have a relaxing weekend with my spouse when every time you get off or on the elevator you get harassed by the timeshare  people with bad attitudes 
6002,Nicely located near shopping centre and subway station Walter Schreiber (9). Many nice little restaurants in the direct neighbourhood for lunch or dinner. Buffet breakfast is served at ground floor for 14 euro pp.
6003,"Good points:  Efficient reception, great library/lookout, amazing spa, excellent housekeeping, great double glazing which is necessary as the building is surrounded by main streets with heavy traffic.   Not so good points:  EUR38/p for breakfast? There is only so much one can eat in the morning. We skipped that and chose one of the lovely cafes near Savigny Platz and had a big delicious brunch for a fraction of the price.   Not enough hanging space in the bathroom, only 2 hooks (behind the shower door for the bathrobes), to reach for the towels you have to exit the shower and walk to the opposite wall.   For a relatively new building (2012) we were surprised to find humidity/mould stains in the sealing of the shower with damaged paintwork, see image. Head of housekeeping should…"
6004,"The hotel needs important maintenance works. The rooms as well as the common areas as pool gym and spa (sauna etc) need maintenance works. It was raining in the gym, the mold in the room shower, painting falling apart everywhere etc etc Not recommended.  "
6005,"I made the reservation at the last minute through Expedia. I was locked in with no escape (50% of the stay) immediately. The first night was four times the rate of night 2 and night 3. As they described, it was the last room on night one. It is the airline model for hotels. At the normal rate the hotel was fine. At the predatory rate it was not worth the money. Go somewhere else - like Imerovigli. Where you can get get a hotel commensurate with the price.  Other than price, the hotel was fine. Very comparable to other hotels. No bar for happy hour at sunset. Breakfast was just OK - lots of bread products. Bottem line: shop around. This place is not worth the price.    Very nice and helpful staff. No problem there. Pricing and owner policies are the problem."
6006," The existing basis is great; good beds, great shower and clean. Improvements: get Dutch speaking staff, stock up on kitchenette appliances because it’s all very limited. A receptionist in rhe reception when arrving would be nice and otherwise a sign when she returns.  Finally: it should be made clear where the entrance is of the hotel plus when with car and luggage one can enter from the parking garage underneath. Signing how to drive in this garage would help. Checking-in on street level with a car turns out ro be a great hassle: parking in the street is impossible and double parking bot allowed. Garage cost are rediculous: 35 euro per day.  Skip the restaurant next door: too expensive for simpelest ‘Spanish’ food."
6007,"Last week, we spent 4 nights in Berlin, entirely for leisure.  The hotel is conveniently located on a main thoroughfare, close for shops and all public transport.  There is no noise from the busy road or from other guests. The room was spacious with both a bath and a walk in shower, free wifi.  Breakfast was plentiful.  A very pleasant stay!"
6008,"I stayed at Louisa’s place for 4 nights with my family (wife and 2 kids aged 7 and 5). The location is great at the western part of Berlin on Kurfürstendamm with shopping places, hop on Hop off bus route and zoo all about 20 mins walk and many cafes before that. We stayed in the Grand suite which was very spacious. All in all a very comfortable stay though an early check in (after a 16 hour flight) would have made the experience even more memorable "
6009,"Don't be fooled. It is not a studio. Just a very small hotel room with a nice bathroom. Extremely small patio with kid size table and chairs. Fireplace is on a timer, have to get out of bed to turn it on. It is very low, so can't see fire from bed. No refrigerator or microwave, only a coffee maker. Very thin walls. Hear all of the neighbors conversations."
6010,"Don't go anywhere near this place until they have finished the construction/renovation. Its dirty and has structural issues (e.g. room 409, where a ball would have rolled downhill due to the warped structure. How they can rent this room, let alone place the bed so that it is totally apparent that the foot of the bed is way higher than the head of the bed is mind boggling).  They got away with charging top dollar  for a sub par property due to location and the fact that they negotiated the rates as part of the conference I was attending. Had I known what I was getting for the $$, I would have gladly paid another 30 dollars a night and stayed at the Hilton two blocks away."
6011,"Booked this hotel through Priceline and payed for it in advance,  Booked a room with double beds as this was a family trip and our teenage son was traveling with us.  Arrived much later than expected due to flight delays and upon check in I was told that there were no double bed rooms available but there was a room with a king bed and sleeper sofa.  (Strike 1) The king size was terribly uncomfortable and the room would not cool down.  (Strike 2) The walls were paper thin and I heard laughing and people walking up and down the halls most of the night.  (Strike 3) don't plan on ever staying there again."
6012,"I give Haymarket 3.5 Stars. I stay here every time I’m in Stockholm so 6-8 times per year, or more. The rooms are well appointed but quite (oppressively) small, and some of the inner rooms don’t have windows - which I hate but might be a nice choice if you have trouble sleeping through Stockholm’s bright summer nights. I always request one of the larger rooms with windows and they are reasonably good at accommodating this request. As a business traveler I have a few beefs with the hotel that keep me from rating it higher. First, the room service menu is terrible. The choices are limited and the food is, generally speaking, a bummer at best. Which isn’t necessarily a deal breaker except that the restaurant gets so busy that at times you can’t get seated if you didn’t have a…"
6013,"good hotel in nice location, frendly people attending you during your stay. Excelent breakfast with various choise of a good and fresh food. Hotel have a good parking area where you can leave your car and enjoy the Ramblas-"
6014,Don’t forget to get a massage :) great location and staff. The rooms are clean and beds comfortable. Nice and quiet on a side street with cute little bistro sets on the patio to enjoy your morning coffee
6015,"We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and we think it was a good experience. The room was always clean when we were back from the day out. The breakfast is good, with nice bread, coffee and juice. The location, close to the Nation station is a big plus. The station has 5 lines, which can take you everywhere on the city. Our room was small, but with enough space for our luggage and, as we stayed out most of the time, it didn't really bother. "
6016,"The hotel's location is great (just down the street from Sagrada Familia), the included breakfast was nice - the room was a bit small but it was very clean. The staff is friendly and helpful. I recommend the hotel 😊"
6017,"Real little gem of a hotel, premium position in Cannes, right by the train station, surrounded by restaurants! Lovely breakfast offered.  Rooms very comfortable, exceptionally clean and tastefully decorated! Staff are very friendly "
6019,"Lovely hotel. Reception not open all the time, but answer your call promptly. Miss having tea or coffee available in the room although you can get it from the dining room, but good to have daily bottle of water. Easy access to centre of Berlin via train."
6020,"Pros:  - San Telmo is a great little area, with cobblestones, lovely shops and the Tango dancers in the market square on Sundays - breakfast was superb - not only was there the usual continental choices but there was also a menu with hot choices such as omelettes etc - I liked the wine tasting. It was every night at 6pm and we were both back to join in - the dining room was quirky (bottles on the wall and under the floor - the terrace at the top of the hotel was great for sunbathing  and the cons?  - we filled in a ""taste and preferences"" form via email before we arrived. I don't know why because it was a complete waste of time as it wasn't used - we paid $48 US for a transfer from the airport to the hotel but a taxi only cost $38 US on the way back. What was worse was that,…"
6021,"We recently stayed at the Hotel Original on a trip with our daughter.  The three single bed room was perfect for our stay.  The room was clean and comfortable and decorated in a fun style.  I cannot say enough positive about the friendly, knowledgable front desk team and other staff members who went out of their way to make our stay a great one.  The area is within walking distance of good restaurants - Brooklyn Pizzeria and Chez Janou are recommended.  A great place to stay in the Bastille area."
6023,"It is a cool place. That big aquarium sold the ""tickets"" for this hotel 😂  Staff is friendly. Great location. Comfortable bed and bed linen and very peaceful over nights. Couldn't hear any noises which made it perfect"
6024,"A very nice place we are in the Residence .and love the apartment, always clean and bright, the cleaner /house maid , is fantastic, bar staff always friendly and helpful, happy hour is a little early, but ok! the hotel on the whole was clean and tidy. reception staff were helpful and happy to be of assistance :] Unfortunately the Food is Terrible! I could go on for hours about it but it is always cooked ahead and left to dry out on the hot press, salad is cut into chunks not sliced as one would expect, Fish always dry and over cooked, Veg just about ok, I wont go on I just didn't eat in the dining room. and ate out all the time"
6025,"Interestant concept, clean, comfortable hotel with a very nice restaurant. In terms of location it will depend on what you want to do in Berlin, in any case it’s in a nice area and well served with transports."
6026,"My one night stay was a nightmare. I have never done a review but can’t sweep this experience under the rug.  Normally I love boutique hotels however when I checked in with my pet I was given room 409 and everything was ok except the view which was of a barbed wire fence, inside a parking ramp, and into my immediate neighbors room. This was AFTER asking at checkin if I could get a room with a good view.  I called down and hotel phone DID NOT work to contact front desk. Once I use my cell and notified staff that I would like a better view they gave me 312🤮  1.) My dog got ahold of a huge bright pill left on the ground that wasn’t mine and should’ve been vacuumed.  2. The shower was dirty. The bathroom light switches were disgusting. 3. The AC had so much mold and dust 4. The…"
6027,$300AUD per night for a 2 star beach front bungalow. The entire resort needs a makeover. It’s pool area is dirty and ancient. The staff are untrained in hospitality and the English language. A total ripoff Bill  EUROA Australia 
6028,"This South beach hotel struggles in every area of service. From restaurant, bar, room quality, front desk. The hotel is in disrepair from critical things like air conditioning, to damaged rooms and pool area..."
6029,"Excellent location with lot of bars and restaurants around Public transport is near by Rooms are big and clean, furniture little bit old but it's ok...if you want quiet room, ask for one not facing the street! Hotel staff very helpful and neat WiFi is avaialble but poor / low qualitiy  Breakfast is ok, nothing special - could be better tho"
6030,The room was filthy.  There was no furniture. The sofa was grimy.  The bathroom was extremely gross.  The staff was rude.  They promised to refund a night because the cleaning staff never showed up and that never happened.  They show pretty pictures of the room but that is not the reality . stay away and DO NOT PREPAY because you will be really taken for a chump
6031,"The included continental breakfast consisted of ONE COFFEE AND ONE PASTRY. Nothing with protein, just a sugar/carb high. Such an expensive hotel should care more about their guests' health and comfort."
6032,"Over the years we have loved staying at this hotel, but it’s gone downhill. Mostly the service. We won’t be staying again. Lots of 5 star hotels in Chicago that will treat you better, and the property is starting to look a little tired."
6033,"I stayed 2 nights checking out May 9th, 2013. Stayed in room 721 which is directly above a nightclub. I could hear the base from the club through my Bose headphones till 2:00 in the morning.  I did not complain to mgt as the music was not there on Tuesday night. However, it was overwhelming on Wednesday night. The problem was that I had a customer dinner until about 10:30 and did not notice the music before undressing. Had to get up at 0500 and thought I could power through it. Bad call.  No bs!"
6034,"In Oia, hotels and villas are not like normal hotels, everything is spread out sporadically on the cliff, especially in this hotel. Therefore let me state that my review is specific for the Aegean exclusive pool villa, where we stayed. Sadly it is not a positive review.  The villa is nice, its one slightly big two room place, suitable for 4 pax, not 5 as they mention. There is only one bathroom, and two toilets. The view is stunning, but most views in oia are. There is no room service, which is a bummer, cause for bfast, which is not much to rave about, you have to walk 80 steps uphill. The surrounding villas/rooms were getting room service, except ours cause we were too far from the kitchen. I was happy to cook it in the room, but they give you bare minimum utensils, not enough…"
6035,"Stayed for one night - was heading south early the following morning - and was initially travelling by train so the hotel was perfect. I changed my plans and ended up hiring a car and used the nearby car park to keep the car overnight. Was charged €22 for the privilege. The hotel appeared quite new, rooms quite average. Comfortable bed. Was recognised as a diamond member so got a (small) beer for that. Had dinner in a local restaurant, breakfast was ok. "
6036,"pros: nice big (unheated) pool area which is great for kids of all ages, roomy floor plans (we were in a marina club I suite with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms with a large balcony), full kitchen (but short on basics like sugar, dishsoap), good showers, and air comditioning, close to restaurants in the marina and 10 minute walk to old town, and we had underground parking.   Cons: number one complaint is the beds, they are small and hard.   They advertise a size of bed (queen) but then state measurements which are smaller than a queen so misleading,  Also, they say coffee making in suite, they really mean a kettle to make 'instant' coffee...they should offer a real coffee maker in the suites.  The decor is fine but a bit 'dated' while online it looks much more up to date.  We were…"
6038,Stayed here in the first week of Dec 16 with my wife. Its a very cozy and super convenient property with some amazing features. The staff is very helpful and we would love to visit again.  Advantages walking distance to St Georges metro  exactly opp supermarket  clean and cozy rooms helpful English speaking staff free wifi at decent speeds quite a few eateries around the place coffee maker in the room comfortable mattress and good sound insulation to keep traffic noise out adequate number of power outlets  electronic safe in the room  Opportunities add more english channels - right now its limited to two BBC news channels arrange head board lamps - too close the bed and would often get knocked   
6040,"Friendly and very helpful staff , great location very close to the tourist district are the positives  Standard room has no view, limited menu in the restaurant are the limitations. All in all a nice experience"
6041,What a great place. The rooms are super nicely decorated and the staff is awesome too. There is no Nespresso machine in the room but otherwise nothing to complain. The breakfast is outstanding and the fitness is super modern. I had a super Jazz concert the evening I was there. The in-house restaurant is best in class but pricy. 
6042,"The palace and its gardens are absolutely gorgeous! Its atmosphere is hard if not impossible to replicate. That goes a long way into making it a 5-star hotel with the service that one might expect from a Leading Hotel of the World. The hotel needs an experienced GM, who looks at the things the international traveler demands from a hotel in this class. I would expect a well stocked bar, that stays open when full of people, cleaning rooms before 4pm, a bathroom that conforms to modern comforts (like a separate shower, not one in the bathtub). If they get this right and deliver consistent service with a smile, this hotel would be hard to beat."
6043,"My wife was attending a legal seminar here so I waited for her in the lobby bar/restaurant area. There were a number of comfortable chairs and couches scattered about the area and I took up residence on a couch with low, block style tables in front of it, much like an ottoman, with the intention of reading and web surfing for the next 5 hours while I waited for my wife. I sat on the couch with my legs stretched out on one of the block ""tables."" I had been reading for several hours when I nodded off to sleep. The next thing I knew, a diminutive woman was standing over me loudly saying ""hello"" several times in an apparent effort to awaken me. Her demeanor was disapproving as she inquired whether I was ""ok"" and did I want to go to my room! Her voice tone was annoyed, if not harsh.…"
6044,"Very central area, lots of old streets around, very busy so a bit noisy. Very comfortable studio with kitchen. Convenient subway Liceu or Catalunya. Very young district. Perfect for family with children. Be careful if balcony on the Ramblas, view is very nice but also noisy."
6045,"Everything was excellent apart from Breakfast arrangements. We had booked the stay understanding that breakfast was included in the agreed booking. It was not and at 18 Euros per person per day it was expensive as it was fairly basic and below the average we have come to expect in recent years of quite extensive travel. Hence the ""very good"" rating"
6046,"The view is really stunning. The hotel is located in front of the Recoleta Cemetery, one of the most beautiful cemetery's in the world. The staff is friendly but the hotel itself is pretty awful. The towels and the sheets were old and broken. The hotel had a sour smell that they tried to cover with cheap cleaning products. Breakfast was average. I would not come back."
6047,"We were on the fourth floor, apparently a chimney from the nearby restaurant led directly to our airvents, the room was full of acrid woodsmoke,  we complained and were told the hotel was full.  We spent the night coughing, with burning eyes.  Never again!"
6048,"This was my third visit and it was excellent in every way. I have no negatives whatsoever to report.   It is a tram ride of 15 minutes approximately from Alexanderplatz, but don’t let that put you off. The trams run very regular.   Hopefully I will return for a fourth visit.   Restaurant recommendation - “Cafe Bar Metropol”. Exit the hotel, turn left and walk to the next tram stop, Petersburger Straße, pass the Netto and its next to the “Wok & Grill” (shared entrance). I had a chicken Thai curry- delicious).  "
6049,"The hotel seems to be in dire need of maintenance. The lobby is virtually devoid of any furniture, the lobby bar is deactivated and even the elevator seems jerky and made weird noises.   The room itself had amazing views, but bathroom fixtures were broken (and the sink quickly clogged), wooden furniture was worn down and the windows didn't fit right, so a lot of noise leaked in from the street.  The breakfast was absolutely bare-bones: the omelette station had 3 choices of fillings--cheese, ham and tomatoes. One type of cold cut cheese and simple turkey breast on the buffet.   This really seems to be a hotel that's simply had absolutely no maintenance in the past 5 years, and is being run on a shoestring budget."
6050,Just spent 3 nights here for annual visit to Retromobile at nearby Portes de Versailles.its my fifth visit and hotel lived up to its past standards. Quiet rooms not large but very adequate good housekeeping nice breakfasts comfortable beds.good bathrooms. Convenient for Metro with nearby underground parking. Book one of the larger rooms with a balcony and you gain a great view of the Eiffel Tower as a bonus.
6052,"We checked into the Presidential Suite where we were given a checkout time at NOON.  Apparently, they had overbooked the room and needed the room at 11am. Despite us accommodating them by allowing the cleaning staff to clean the area while we were packing our bags, we received 7 phone calls from 11 am to 11:20 with a threat to  call the security.  When I spoke to the manager after we left the room at 11:30, we were given lip service that they will investigate and call us back. They never did. Stayed in this hotel over 10 times in the last 18 years. Its gone from a class hotel to a Motel service.  If they can do this to a guest at their presidential suite, imagine what they can do to other guest.  Would never go back. No Manners, No Integrity. Truly other excellent choices of…"
6053,"The hotel offers a great location, being just a block away from the famous copacabana beach. Unfortunately that's really where the positives end. The room was tiny with no space to even put up two suitcases. We had to remove everything from the one table in the room and place it on the floor so we could put our suitcases up. The bed had long black hairs throughout the linen (neither I, nor my partner has long black hair). The A/C only had a temperature control; no further adjustments. The hotel offers free wi-fi which is great but you will end up wanting to throw your phone at the wall since the internet cuts out every 5 or 10 mins. However, the shower was really good.   The staff were friendly with many speaking some English,  however they were not very helpful.  We tried to…"
6054,Great location and serviced by the M1 tram so easy to get around from this hotel. Nice warm welcome. Our room on the 4th floor was comfortable but dated had everything you needed except tea/coffee which caught us out. Good mini bar though. Restaurant on site but we didn’t use it so can’t comment on the food but it looked good. We would stay again . 
6056,When we arrive with group ask for higher room receptionist had an attitude  !!problem was not solved and she was very smug about it !  Since the first person you are  in contactat at hotels  is the front desk help they should be extremely nice polite and knowledgeable and have no attitude ( sorry I didn’t get her name )  Breakfast was average no gluten free items Unless you call-cake gluten free item for breakfast ! took long time to clean dishes from tables  day 2. at breakfast did fine Waitress could speak English and was willing to help me Day 2 meet a very nice front desk  Receptionist name Rita  She was polite helpful  friendly and informative  Room was small  A little tired !!bed comfortable  Bathroom small and never in 3 days replace the toiletries unless I called and…
6057,"This was my first stay at an Embassy Suite hotel and I was excited!  We checked in in the evening and the receptionist told us to hurry and check out the evening reception. So we hurried over there, not knowing what to expect. We walk there and there is a long line waiting at the bar for alcoholic drinks and the snack area is empty with a mess all over the tables.  We turned around and walked right out back to the registration area. When asked why we came back so soon, we just said “that’s ok.” We get our room which was a premium one bedroom suite. The room at first glance was nice, but it wasn’t. There was no snacks that were supposed to provided. We called the front desk to find that the buttons on the telephone were sunken in so I used a pen to dial the front desk. The snack…"
6058,"I remember walking by this place when it was the Indigo Hotel and I always thought it looked so cute.  So after being away from Chicago for years I decided to do a solo trip and choose the Claridge House.  Sure the lobby is nice and trendy but that’s where it ends.  One of the elevators was broke which led to extremely long waits to get up to your room.  The rooms themselves were shabby looking as if it was a spring break hotel.  It’s close to division/state bars so at night people run down the halls screaming and at one point I was scared....  parking is inconvenient and they don’t offer room service as advertised.  ITS A DUMP!  There are much better places to stay in Chicago, don’t go here."
6059,"The hotel is in a great location, very nearby a metro stop and there is a grocery store 1 minute away. When people complain about street noise in reviews I don't usually have any issues myself, but I did have a problem with the street noise getting in the way of a solid night's sleep. It may have been in combination with the bed which wasn't very comfortable. They charge 1 euro per bag to hold for the day and bags are held in a very secure room!"
6060,"Boyfriend and I had to stay in a dormitory style room of 8 beds. Lockers were big, and they provided linens. The bathrooms were big and also dormitory style. No hot water. The booking company messed up our reservation, and so we had to sleep on the same small bed, which we would've probably done anyways, so the hostel gave us some money back as a result. Location isn't great. Decent amenities. "
6061,"Spacious clean apartment near metro station. The apartment  had everything you need for a few days' stay (tea, coffee, cooking utensils, washing powder). Bed linen was changed every second day. Ckeaning was every day. Unfortunately internet wasn't good and we had logins only for two persons (we were three of us). It wasn't always convenient to go to the hotel office because it's almost 1 km far away. The stuff was very polite and friendly."
6062,"I stayed here with my parents for a quick visit to Berlin in September. The location was perfect;100m away from the Underground station. Breakfast range was amazing and pastries to die for! The room/suite was basic, neat and spacious, perfect for a quick visit. The staff was very helpful."
6063,"There was an amazing variety of food for breakfast, constantly replenished. The hotel is in a quiet residential neighbourhood only 10 minutes walk from the Bellevue S-Bahn station (1 stop West of the Hauptbhanhof)."
6064,"Stayed at the 9Hotel on my first night in Paris.  Quaint and lovely hotel, located close to everything.  I walked to restaurants and there's a starbucks near by.  Make sure you ask about happy hour -- they have wine on tap!  "
6065,Great location & price but hotel dirty & almost no staff. Only beds & a fridge in the room - nowhere to put your bags or cupboards. No bathmat or face washers. Bthrm exhaust super-thick with gunk. Yuk
6066,Excellent service. We had breakfast each morning.  They had gluten free options.  One can store food in the refrigerator for snacks later. Convenient to La Croissette. Great place to stay. We will come back!
6067,"We stayed at the Art HOtel over the Christmas holiday.  While we loved its central location, and didn't mind the size of the small rooms, we were very unimpressed with the staff.  They were completely indifferent and unhelpful.  Their only contribution to our stay was to suggest a tango show which was not only a rip off, but provided by far one of the worst meals we have ever had (the rest of time, we ate exceptionally well in BsAs; try Bar Uriarte, Sucre, Sudestada, La Brigada, Gran Bar Danzon).  Unwilling to make reservations on our behalf, directing us to the Internet when we asked questions about things to do around town...I don't understand what their function was, other than to sour our stay.  I wish we shared the great experience of some of the other reviwers here, but…"
6068,"Stayed at this hotel as part of a 4 night trip to BCN The hotel still seems very new and shiny, but feels like it will age quickly as some of the decor has gone for style over quality.  Bed is very comfortable and good quality bed linen.  The design of the rooms is tasteful but there are some small annoying details eg. master light switch turns everything off but doesn’t turn everything on again so you have to individually turn each light on ; shower tray is too shallow so water ends up going on the bathroom floor ;  Breakfast is fantastic, abundant and served until 11h00 so perfect for late risers.  The bar and restaurant were empty outside of breakfast hours, even on a special night when there was a DJ playing..... the menu was again quite modern.  The staff were all extremely…"
6069,The hotel has a nice localization near to the most important touristcs points of Berlin. Its room is clear and confortable so as the whole installation. Its personnel staff is cordial and nice and ready to help you  
6071,"This hotel is out of the way, doesn't have much of a pool and the beach across the street is dirty and filled with trash. also a woman got robbed right outside of the entrance one late afternoon.    The rooms are fine, but no one speaks English and there are no cabs around to take you anywhere, need a car.  "
6072,"I stayed only one night in this boutique hotel. The premises are great, superior room perfect for businesstrip purposes. Eco Products in the bathroom were hip. Breakfast offering was very nice and targeted for those who value healthier options like granola, fresh berries. Only downside was slow and unsure Service which descreased my customer experience. Service was warm and nice though and surely they did their best. Would come again! "
6073,"The room was okay, nothing especial; however, the bathrooms were tiny, could not even move around and I'm a small person.  The customer service was very poor. The front desk guy, (African Brazilian) very judgmental and did not help us with our luggage on the way out. He asked us to move the luggage ourselves before doing the check out. I had 5 luggage and two kids, and I had to be constantly with my kids because they do not speak Portuguese. Very poor customer service!!"
6074,"Well laid out room and sitting area, clever tv that rotates between the 2. sufficient lighting. good shower.  Stayed for 3 nights - every day the room key stopped working and had to replace - slow lifts, slow reception, wasted 10 minutes each day. Bed not comfortable and pillows flat. plumbing terrible - sink, toilet, shower - don't do what they're supposed to. Have a nice stay."
6075,"My (new) husband and I stayed here during the last week of our honeymoon, we splashed out on this hotel and paid extra for an ocean view and the access to 4 pools and a private beach.  On arrival the staff we friendly and welcoming, however we soon discovered that 3 of the 4 pools were closed for refurbishment. We were not made aware of this upon arrival or booking and we may have stayed at an alternative hotel if we had known.  To say sitting by the pool was relaxing would be an exaggeration. The drilling, constant building work could be heard from 8am until late into the evening. The staff tried to drown out the noise with a DJ but it only anger us more with constant noise. The private beach did not escape the noise leaving nowhere peaceful and relaxing to spend our day. All…"
6076,"I was disappointed in the hotel.  The location is great, but don’t get your hopes up for a grand hotel stay. There are no frills.  The hotel is small with average rooms, the bathroom is cramped.  The dining was just average and my food was served cold. The pool and terrace with bar at the top is fine but there are comparable terrace at other hotels nearby. It has only two elevators to service 20 floors, and they are so small they feel over-crowded with 4 to 5 people. There is no coffee maker, they just have a kettle for tea.  The hair dryer only blew cold air, they didn’t have one that fit into the 220V plug.  I had to ask twice to get a hair dryer that did.  I was told upon check-in that my breakfast was included with my stay, they charged me for breakfast and then would not…"
6077,"The hotel itself is located just opposite exit 8, People’s Square Station. You can pretty much get anywhere in Shanghai from the Metro and traveling from the Airport to the hotel was hassle free.Upon arrival we were told that there were no doubles available despite having booked and pre-paid for one. Not great for your honeymoon but we made do.The Sky Lounge is impressive and not super expensive all things considered. However, travelers beware, if paying by card you’ll be charged your home countries currency which boosts the price of drinks. Probably a school boy error on our part.The hotel is clean and the staff very helpful. Was provided with a travel adapter to charge my phone as struggled to find a local shop that sold them. Which was welcomed.Unfortunately at the time of…"
6078,The Hotel is on the Main Street of downtown Barcelona (Paseo de Gràcia) Beautiful area with lots of nice shops and restaurants. I was lucky to get a balcony facing the street.  Breakfast and a happy hour was included. The staff was very nice and helpful. Will recommend this hotel to all my friends and family. There’s no pool or a big lobby at this hotel tho.
6079,"For the price we paid, this is a terrible place. We paid $400++ per night and they dont give you a bottle of water! Very small room, the water in the bathtub faucet was brown with gunk when I first turned it on. We asked for a bathroom scale (to weigh our luggage) and the reception lend us one provided that we give it back ASAP (also subtly rude! ), this was 11pm at night, who needs it at night at the reception?! The only people there worth praising are the bellhops who did a great job at making the guests welcome. If you are willing spend the money, spend it where you get a service"
6080,"I was surprised how modern the rooms where. It was a lot smaller than shown in photos online. But it sufficed.  The only thing that really let us down was when we came back to the room at the end of our day, the cleaner had snapped our adapter for our phone charger. Half of it was left in the wall and the other half she put on the window ledge. The fact she left it without saying anything was dissapointing. My husband tried to take it out of the wall and got an electric shock. We went down and told reception that they broke our adapter and that half of it is in the wall, they got the handyman to remove it from the wall, and that was it. No compensation for the broken adapter or no concern for the fact that my husband got electrocuted. We couldn’t believe it...  "
6081,"I think this hostel was the cheapest option that I found in Berlin and it was really comfortable. Nice hall, nice workers. But if you are planning to use a shared room please think it that is the cheapest option and the rooms are always full of people from different ages. I think that Neukoln is a good location but you have to know how to use the public transport ;) The big disadvantage is the WIFI, they only give you 12 hours free. After those 12 hours (no matter how many days you are staying) they give you every day like one or two hours for free, for more you have to pay extra."
6083,The Hotel is quiet new and rooms are very comfortable. We missed nothing during our stay. The staff is friendly and fluent in english.  We went before 8 a.m. down for breakfast and had no issue to get a table for three. Beside of the room rate the location is the big benefit of the hotel. It is close to the subway Stadion Klosterstrasse where the U2 stops and from there you can reach out  Alexander Platz and all other Must-See-Places of Berlin. I can defenetely recommend this Hotel. 
6084,"We booked a suite. Looking at other reviews the friendly staff is very important. But if your beds are hard as a rock, the door of the bathroom hits your knees, breakfast is very poor and the view from your balcony looks into the kitchen of a restaurant? "
6085,The hotel is beautiful and the rooms are well appointed and large. The breakfast is also great. However the help is not the best.  We had a problem with out shower (only HOT water came out). I complained to the front desk and they sent a worker to the room. He felt the water with his hand and said it was OK.  It was one temperature (scalding). Since we were leaving I informed the front desk that unless they fixed the problem they would continue to have unhappy guests. They then sent a plumber who spent a few hours fixing the shower. In addition the maid service was almost non existent. This is an expensive hotel and I would expect more for the money
6086,"Fabulous apartment room - cheapest room type: studio. It had a huge bed, sitting area and kitchen with fridge, job and microwave and separate, modern, fab power shower. All clean, spacious and well decorated. Didn’t break the bank.  The location is fantastic. Within a five minute walk are the TV Tower and main station Alexanderplatz, Hackescher Mkt and Hofe with all their fab restaurants and bars, the River Spree, Museum Island, the Cathedral and Unter Den Linden which leads to Brandenburg Gate. It’s about a twenty min walk to Brandenburg Gate from the hotel and a further five to the Reichstag. (We are quick walkers though!) Book a tour of the Reichstag a few weeks before you go or if you just want to go up the Dome, also book ahead for a slot or try breakfast, lunch or dinner…"
6087,"Firstly location and hostel interior (lobby areas and such) are great.  However we found our private room somewhat lacking: it was really small, had poor soundproofing and defunct air conditioning unit."
6088,"The hotel is nice in terms of location, room and foods. The horrible experience was during check in, I came early at 7:30 am. I would like to check in, it didn’t matter for me to get the hotel room immediately. But the receptionist cannot find my name in his system. I showed him the booking reservation confirmation, he still insisted that my name was not in the system. Well, he was kind enough to let me put my luggage at the hotel. But the hotel is really strange in terms of how they handle reservation. In the afternoon, I came back to check in, and fair enough the reservation was actually there. The receptionist this time was sick and sneezing. Amazing as to why she was working the front desk dealing with guests. Aside from the receptionist, the bell boys were helpful. Room was…"
6089,"Stayed two nights in March of 2012 th my 15 year old.  Although the hotel common areas are nicely appointed; our room was so small as to be oppressive.  I booked on-line through the hotel website before my trip.  The full charge was processed to my credit card more than 10 days  before arrival. I booked a mid priced room; not a suite, not the cheapest category.  Room was so tight that a second suitcase could not be opened anywhere except on the floor or the bed, which then had to be closed and moved if you needed to move around on the room.  No closet in the room; an armoire that served as shelf, closet, safe, rod for a few garments.  Bathroom even smaller...shower curtain sticks to you when showering.  Fan/air vent ran loudly and constantly-had to keep bathroom door closed. …"
6090,"Lots of issues with my stay. I live in Chicago but was taking the bar exam at this hotel so I figured I should stay there to avoid Lollapalooza commuting in the mornings. Mistake.  1. Called beforehand to ask if there would be a mini-fridge in the room since I needed to bring food to eat in the mornings before the exam. Was assured there would be one. Got to hotel and they said sorry, it's first come first served and we have none left. Thank God I have a friend who lives a couple blocks away where I could store all the food I'd brought.  2. Shower didn't work in the morning.  3. BIGGEST ISSUE. I had to be up at 5 am so I went to bed early. Woke up at around midnight to the sound of doors slamming and loud music. Turns out the people in the room next to me thought it'd be fun to…"
6091,Very welcoming hotel and staff helpful at all times.  Important to have consistency of standard of room and facilities when on business and this can be relied upon at the Ibis Budget Cannes Centre Ville
6092,"I had booked with my credit card which was charged to my room 1363 and again during check in I was asked to pay for the duration of my stay which was "" Breach of trust "" being HH member .I had to speak to the Front office for refund amount . the room and the ambiance of the property is par excellence expect the Room service. Even after repeated request for the replenishment of Tea / coffee sachets they said they had shortage of staff which is not expected from HILTON which is a Global brand.i would not recommend this property !"
6093," There are plenty of reasons for this hotel's loyal and loving following. The 19th Century charm and quiet elegance is coupled with new bathrooms, efficient and welcoming front desk service, lovely little parlor with old books, and double rooms big enough for two with luggage. You're near Notre Dame and the Pantheon and the Metro is a block away (although you'll need to change lines to reach the airport). Even on the second floor, street noise was minimal; practically nothing with the windows closed. There's a small elevator and an Art Deco staircase for a better period feel. Upper floors have balconies. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel, which seemed pricey. There are fine cafes nearby.   "
6094,International standard property with all the amenities of a good 4 star resort.....but flawed by the room we were allocated. It’s simply not possible to enjoy sitting on the balcony due to the air conditioning exhaust noise. I might add this is the exhaust from the public rooms so not within our power to influence.  Having complained there is apparently nothing that can be done........which is difficult to believe given the size of the Pestana estate.
6095,This is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed in the first room we were given stank of smoke so we asked to change which to be fair was done with no problems however the second room was just as dirty and grim there was paint falling off the walls old and out dated furniture marks on the bedding!! The bathroom it self was horrendous we found hair all over the shower dirty towels and the back of the hair dryer was broken which frankly is a hazard! We ended up moving hotels as I could not face one night In there!
6096,Worth staying for a short stay in Berlin. We spent 3 days and we really enjoyed. Great breakfast and breakfast area. Very close to the Zoo and KaDeWe as well to the two stops of Hop on Hop Off bus. Specially during Christmas next to christmas village in Protestant Church. 
6097,"Very Nice hotel. Close to bus stop for Charles de Gaulle Airport bus #2. Also close to L'Arc de Triumph, Tour Eiffel and Trocadero. The Night Portier was very friendly and service minded. This will now become my regular Paris Hotel :-)"
6098,"We arrived to Berlin on 12th of July 2017 for the U2 concert, so we tried to find a hotel closed to the Olympia Stadium. The hotel was easy to be reached from the Schonefeld Airport and 2-3 min by walking from the Bismarkstasse UBahn metro station. The accommodation was just fitted for our purpose, as we didn't come to Berlin to stay in the room, nor for a romantic journey: room was clean, equipped with towels, friendly shower and very quiet (our room had a view to the backyard). The ladies from the reception were kind and efficient and the personnel from the restaurant is one of the best I ever saw: quiet, professional and always taking care of something but in a peaceful manner, so you could barely notice their presence. We appreciated the food variety, so only if on diet…"
6099,"Bad points - Poor food choice & lousy entertainment Local - cheap nasty drinks. Rather isolated - Bus or taxi ride reqd to Funchal town (limited free shuttle bus provided but not evenings   Good points - General appearance , staff , gardens & pools were fine    "
6100,The hotel is well appointed and comfortable.   The view from the rooftop was very pretty and our room offered  several extras to make our stay quite pleasant.  The hotel arranged for pick from the airport and transfer to our cruise ship.  The staff are friendly and helpful.
6102,"I stayed in 5 hotels on my Spain and Portugal trip so I had a good comparison. While none of the issues ruined my stay, combined they caused me to issue an average rating.  It started when I checked in - they said I did not have a reservation for me.  After investigating, they said that hotels.com was at fault and that they had only 1 room left. The bathroom had what looked like mold in the tub(see the picture), the clothes line did not work, the a/c was hit or miss, and the safe did not work. The shower head was broken but they fixed that after we reported it.   Other reviews say this is in a good location, but I disagree. It is very close to the Anjos metro stop, but all the good sights require a long walk or taking the metro. The surrounding area is not what I would call…"
6103,"We have stayed at other Pestanas and were disappointed with the Ocean Aparthotel. The location was poor. Yes, there are wonderful restaurants just along the road but it would have been nice to have eaten in the hotel if the prices were not so high. The staff are friendly, and the rooms are serviced every day. After staying in the Pestana Promenade, I think we have been spoilt . The excellent bus route is at the top of the hill, but for anyone with walking difficulties The Ocean Aparthotel is not for them."
6104,"Hi there!I would strongly recommend this place for staying in Berlin.Only a few minutes from the train station,also plenty tram and bus connections.Pretty central location.Very friendly,welcoming staff!🙂 The room was perfectly clean,decently furnished..even the bathroom.I liked it and would stay here again,without a second thought!👍"
6105,"First of all this is a fantastically located hotel overlooking Fateh Sagar Lake. The rooms are done up with the expected fittings and have balconies to sit out and watch the lake.  The rooms and exterior surroundings are much nicer than the functional lobby & the  very poorly done restaurant inside.  Prices are in the range of the Trident and you expect service to be similar.  We were travelling with an 80 year old and the hotel couldn't keep its elevator functional for the day and half we were there. Food was pretty average and relatively expensive.  Service needs huge improvement in terms of responsiveness & speed.  All in all, a fantastically located hotel crying out for a professional hotel chain to manage it."
6106,"Great hotel in a convenient location. The room had a decent size for Paris, nice interior and very friendly staff. We felt very welcomed. The breakfast buffet was also very good and was a great start for the day. Would definitely recommed"
6107,Everything about the Clift is old and tired.  It fits right in with the local area.  There’s not even a restaurant for dinner.  You can eat in the bar - if you can find a table but given most of the space is open this is by no means guaranteed.  Do yourself a favour and go somewhere else.
6108,"Very nicely situated hotel, almost in the airport, very clean and with welcoming staff... BUT and its a big but, there are no bathroom walls ! Only a curtain separates the bathtub from the bed and there's no door into the general oblutions area PLUS there's see through doors on the toilet and shower ? This may be ""modern"" Portugal but it's certainly NOT for me and I would never be able to stay here again. When they design these odd rooms do they ever stop to consider the practicalities ? Imagine being totally woken up by your partner every time they decide to visit the ""bathroom"" not only by the light but also the completely non existing sound proofing too. Absolutely awful..."
6109,"The hotel is very clean and comfortable, and the staff extremely nice and helpful. Location is good, near subway stations and about 10 mins walk from Alexanderplatz and museum island. Breakfast is OK, but they could make sure to refill the bread baskets instead of leaving them empty (we had to ask for bread and wait ~20 mins until it was ready)"
6110,"This hotel is too far away from the city in my opinion, certainly not worth the price we paid to stay here. It is only a 5 minute walk to the train and bus station, the train takes 5 minutes into the city and the bus around 20 minutes into the city, however, if you want to return back to the hotel after midnight, it's EUR20 in a taxi. If you don't stay out until late, then it is worth getting a 48hr travel pass, which is EUR12.50, but you can't use it on the train, only bus, metro and tram.  I would prefer to pay a little more per night and stay in the city.   The hotel is simple, but clean, beds are comfortable and staff are friendly."
6111,Sir Albert hotel was perfectly described by one of its reception staff as design over function! our room was the strangest we have ever seen. The wash basin was in the bedroom with a walk in shower as you entered the room. Unfortunately after showering the only area to dry oneself was back in the bedroom. This lack of privacy must surely in some cases lead to embarrassment. The sophisticated lighting system via a console was hit and miss and as we had to pay 60 euros to upgrade to twin beds we were not over impressed. The breakfast was reasonable but the hot food failed to maintain its heat as only the items on the bottom were retaining their heat.. On the plus side the staff were excellent and very helpful apart from the check out man who tried to charge us extra for breakfast!
6112,"My husband and I recently took a quick trip to Paris to celebrate my birthday and we chose Hotel Saint Germain at the suggestion of a friend and our experience could not have been any better!  The hotel is a small boutique property with exceptional service, lovely amenities and very helpful and kind staff - the room was small by US standards (typical in size for European boutiques) but immaculate and well appointed.  The staff were extremely accommodating and helpful.  We were so grateful that our room was available upon our arrival so early in the morning after our long trip.  On my actual birthday they delivered a beautiful bouquet of red roses that my husband had ordered and accompanied it with a delicious and gorgeous raspberry tart on a silver tray complete with candle and…"
6113,"Drunk people running around at 1am, Doors slamming at 2am, really loud elevators prevent sleep, room dirty .......Really sub standard hotel and the price tag was way too high for such low quality. Better off at a motel unfortunately. "
6114,"Clean, spacious apartment with everything you need except an oven. Maids were available every day to refresh things.  We were in a nice position for the pool, unfortunately the pool was so cold it was empty all the time, I've been to resorts with cold pools before but this was on another level, need to look into heating them for this time of year. Reception didn't give much info on what was happening during the week and so we left each evening for the bars and restaurants outside. Pool bar and resort restaurants very expensive, OK for a couple but a no, no for families. RCI users watch out for the 65 euro fee for 'amenities'. You are warned before you go if you read the small print. "
6115,We went to Paris for Valentine’s Day and took our children ages 8 and 11 years olds with us for 4 nights. It was our first 1st trip to Europe. I highly recommend this hotel well located with fabulously friendly staff. I can not say enough good things. The room was modern and clean. Location was perfect there is an awesome bakery next door and on the other side 2 business down is a place with great chicken and wonderful customer service. There is a supermarket/monoprix few blocks away. The best part is the subway/metro right across the street it takes you all over for a little less than 2 euros and happy to give you directions. Eiffel Tower is an easy 15 min walk. The location is clean and safe well worth our stay. You can rent device for internet access to take with you while…
6116,"Stayed on a recent work trip that involved a conference at the nearby palais de congres. Lovely and clean rooms of a good size for Europe. I had colleagues stay at other hotels of the same standard near the conference venue and this was by far the best choice. Only downside is that dinner/in room dining options in the hotel are basically non existent, although plenty of eateries are close by, sometimes you just can't be bothered. Would stay again"
6117,"Location is great - right in the heart of where we wanted to be Decor is modern, fresh and hip - impressed Reception were fairly quick to check us in and the check out process is simple as Breakfast was something we didn't have, but from what I could see, it looked decent The bar is simply awesome.......it's open 24hrs! Cool courtyard terrace for chilling in with their lounger seating  Rooms are extremely basic, but that's why the price is affordable for a downtown city hotel  But it's clean and covers everything you need for a short city break"
6118,"On a recent visit to Berlin, the 3 of us, Mom, Dad, and 21-year-old daughter stayed at the Derag Livinghotel. Excellent choice. Rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. We all slept well. We were given the combo of rooms 564 (Kingsize bed) and 565 (Single bed). The latter is great if travelling with a teenager who seeks some privacy ... with single bed and separate shower and bathroom facilities."
6119,"I have picked up this hotel because of two reasons: 1) very good reviews at Tripadvisor 2) being platinum elite member of Marriott group. Unfortunately I was very disappointed. It is typical Chinese hotel that shows nice photos although the reality is totally different. Here is a quick summary: A) The hotel is located in an awful area, views from windows are scary. B) Although we have arrived during the day time, nobody greeted us at the hotel entrance. When a lift boy walked out and saw our two big luggage he just stared at us without any intention to help. C) Executive Lounge serves food not better than a local fast food restaurant. D) The only positive thing is the size of the room."
6122,"a new and very modern hotel but a lot of designing mistakes: a transparent toilet room ""sophisticated"" taps  dark room (we could not read) the staff was outstanding! all of them, nice, cooperative and very helpfull."
6123,"My fiance and I stayed at Park Hyatt Mendoza for two nights in December 2014. The hotel was highly recommended to us by friends.  The first room we were put in had a smell of rotten eggs and there were still someone else's dirty towels in the bathroom. We requested to be put in a different room, which appeared to be more difficult than necessary to be. Three hours later our request has been completed.  Prior to our arrival to Argentina, I contacted the hotel to help us find a good horse back riding tour and a vineyard hoping tour. Both tours were booked on the same day only half hour apart. No apology came from the hotel. The rooms are very outdated, the beds are terribly uncomfortable. Breakfast is very limited. The kitchen staff is even unable to follow orders and include the…"
6125,"Loft rooms are grate if you are shorter than 170 CM which all my family is, so it caused us no problem. The main issue is a lack of AC in the room - I know when I did my booking I should have checked but I took that as a given in this day and age that any hotel will have an AC in the rooms, I think in Berlin you would need an AC for two week out of the year unfortunately we hit that  buried during our stay. The other issue that we had was related to the swimming pool being closed for renovations, one of the main reason I books this hotel was the pictures of the fantastic swimming pool it was a bit odd that they would close out the swimming pool in the august. I would definitely stay hear again but not in August and I will check to make sure that the pool is open. "
6126,"We booked this hotel primarily due to its proximity to the Berlin Marathon. Family of 4 so we booked two rooms as no double rooms were available. Were very happy with the hotel....very comfortable...and with a beautiful pool! 10 minute walk to Patzdamer Platz and from there you can go anywhere. Since Marathon is very early and restaurants weren’t open, they allowed my husband to get coffee from the breakfast area which was much appreciated! Rooms were near pool area but still very quiet.   Now as for whether it was good for the marathon...because much of the Tiergarten Park is blocked off, it was a little farther than anticipated getting to the start line. Still very doable...just longer. And the finish line was even longer. Normally busses are closer to this hotel, but not…"
6127,"Beautiful city! Absolutely amazing service. We were so pleased with very knowledgeable, friendly, responsible team. I would recommend to everyone who would like to be served pleasantly well nice hotel Lyric. Thank you so much to all of you! Best of the best!  Irene and Jurij"
6128,"Lovely clean and functional room. Nice toiletries. Fab breakfasts, especially the home made cakes and the honeycomb. Friendly staff. I would have loved to be able to make a cup of tea in the room, I just assumed they'd be tea/coffee making facilities especially as I arrived late and just needed a hot drink. Lovely place though."
6129,"I guess if you get the most expensive room in the place this place alright. But the first night we were put in the room under the bar which was noisy, both drawers in the dresser were broken, the shower head was broken, and the wifi didn't work in the room. I am not sure why they would even put someone in a room like that. George, the owner, is not that friendly either. He gave us a lot of attitude when we complained about the room and made us pay to change rooms."
6130,"Stayed during mid-March. Check in with Duarte and Brian was fast, efficient. Third person on March 14, 2018, working with them was not helpful at all. Upon getting off the elevator on Floor 2 was greeted by darkness, interrupted by light sensors. The hallway was cold and damp. Room had a queen size bed which was comfortable, but the layout of the room was POOR. The bed was up against the wall. There was NO nightstand so you could place an alarm clock and glasses. At the end of the room was a small stand with a phone. A desk provided some semblance of normalcy for travel paperwork. A bureau was insufficient for clothing. It also housed an easily-programmable safe. The heating/AC unit provided no relief. The bathroom was cramped as the sink jutted almost out of that room. Hot…"
6131,"Hotel's location is good, but not perfect, being close to many restaurants but a bit too far to walk to the city center (2 km), especially if you want to walk back after a nice dinner. It is an old building (probably end of 60s) and you can see many signs of tiredness. There is a spa, good bar, acceptable swimming pool (although people do not take showers before entering it) and very good breakfast. Size of the rooms is OK, they are having same old touch as the hotel itself, with worn out furniture, but are clean, with acceptable air conditioning. The ones with so called ""sea vie"" (first You see very busy street crossing can be very noisy, depending on the traffic below, but give good view on Funchal. All in all, acceptable for its price, but not thrills - except very nice bar…"
6132,"Advantage: The hostel is very near to the train station. The place looks safe as there are still a lot of people on the streets even if you'll return back late. The ambiance at the reception is homey. Everything a guest need is there but for a price e.i vendo machine the sell locks, cotton buds, earphone etc. You can leave your luggages 24hours for a certain amount. Fast wifi.  Disadvantage: The toilet looks clean but it stinks. It smell like dried pee. We stayed with them for 3 nights and 4 days but the floor was never cleaned. There are 2 nights that our sleep was disturbed due to the loud sound of a party on the next building. There is no A/C. There's no nearby supermarket."
6133,"We stayed here for 5 nights recently, in one of the more expensive rooms right next to the ""swimming"" pool. Initial impressions were good, great location, amazing views and it seemed clean when we arrived. Over the course of our stay we noticed bad room cleaning, including no linen changes as far as we could tell. Ants in the kitchenette which we had to highlight to the hotel even though the room had apparently been cleaned that morning. The jacuzzi was filthy, dead bugs and a thick layer of grime around the rim. Breakfast was bizarre and unappealing, despite there being a wide range of choice. The staff were very nice and helpful, however some well-needed changes in their operating procedure would make this a much more enjoyable place to stay."
6134,"The view on the roof offers one of the best views in the city of the Sagrada Familia. That being said, if you go during the day you have to get drinks all the way at the first floor and carry them up. It's a trade off, but the view, in my opinion, makes it worth it."
6135,"We were traveling with 3 kids, the youngest just one years old. It was hard for us to find a hotelroom big enough and most hotels offered us two rooms. At Adagio we could have one apartment that were perfect for us. The kitchen even had a dishwasher! Clean fresh and nice. Everything just perfect. "
6136,"We stayed here 4 nights and we had to move room due to noisy guests (not the hotels fault), but they did everything they could to accommodate us.  Breakfast is a standard continental, nothing special, but it was breakfast - only thing is that there are signs saying you will be charged if you take food away, which was a bit weird.  The rooms are spacious for a European city hotel.  My only complaint was that the aircon only operates during the summer and it was hot enough in March for us to feel warm at night.  The location is great, about 15 minute walk from the beach or from the city sights - we walked to most places or used the very reasonable metro for others."
6138,"I cannot recommend this wonderful hotel /home highly enough. Sabine ,our hostess thought of everything to make my stay memorable.. lt truly was like staying in someone's very comfortable and welcoming home. The breakfasts deserve a special mention. Sitting down with Sabine and the other guests at a table full of fresh  healthy food was a delight,. The location was ideal for all sightseeing and public transport. Who needs a concierge when you have Sabine? If you want to stay in a small personal hotel then you will not find anything better . Thank you,Sabine."
6139,"We spent two nights in this hotel which was in a great location. The staff were excellent, they spoke great English and the hotel was lovely. We had a room with a balcony which was perfect for sitting outside with a glass of wine. Unusually for many hotels it had a brilliant hairdryer and toiletries. The breakfast was very good and they provided tea, coffee and cake between 4 and 6 for guests."
6141,"We booked a room in this hotel for 2 nights mainly because of its location - 10 minutes from the beach and relatively close to the centre of Barcelona. The hotel is situated in the post-industrial Poblenou where I lived for about a month in the past so I was familiar with the place. The hotel is not only close to the beach but it is also a few minutes away from La Rambla de Poblenou with nice cafes and tapas bars, very different from La Rambla in the centre of Barcelona. There are more locals, less tourists and it is much more convivial so it's nice to go for a walk, observe the locals and have some nice food.    The hotel is modern and generally clean. The hotel room was OK, a bit tired. It was quite spacious and had a comfortable bed. It was a bit stuffy every time we walked…"
6142,"We arrived late on 18 November and was tired.  We had requested a non smoking room but got an uncleaned smoking room instead with smoking smells on the sheets and a bathroom that could do with some elbow grease.  The room looked out onto a dirty ledge and wall with no view whatsoever  Do check that you get what you asked and paid for as the Reception seemed to have sprung that on us weary travellers who arrived late in the night needing shower and sleep.  We complained the next day and got another room.  The breakfast was not good - nothing much for the Western traveller.   Staff not really engaged and unfocused.  This is a 3-star hotel, not a 4-star.  There was a wedding at the hotel - people were making alot of noise in the corridor outside our room late into the night and the…"
6143,"I checked in to the Adina Northbank with minimal fuss, asked politely for a midday check out instead of 11 and was told only 1pm was available and it would be $60 for the two hours. I politely declined. I booked at late notice and paid $131 on booking.com  Later, returning to the property after dinner I went to swipe into the secure door outside and my key card didn’t work. I buzzed the intercom for five minutes. It was 2005 and the door locks at 2000hrs. Two men then approached the door from inside and wouldn’t get out. It was quite humorous but awkward. Eventually we pushed the door at the same time and I got in, they got out. No receptionist in sight.   The apartment boasts a kitchenette, full fridge and washer and dryer; but no clothes washing powder or liquid.   Lastly; I…"
6144,"Hôtel de Flore was amazing! No frills hotel in Montmartre, exactly what I needed.  The staff were 100% terrific! My smartphone died before I got there, and a new one was sure not in my budget, so I hammered with constant questions. They were all wonderful. Went out of their way to accommodate me. This hotel is so clean! It's quiet, my room and bed were very comfortable, and I wish I had that shower here at home. It's conveniently located near shops, and about two blocks from the metro station. The breakfast was delicious. I've never had ham that good in my life! It was all fabulous, much much nicer than I expected, but what I will remember is the staff. From the domestic staff on up, 6 out of 5 stars!"
6145,"I stayed at Orania.Berlin last month with my wife while we were visiting her family coming from San Francisco.  As a past manager in the hospitality industry, I have a very discerning and critical eye when I visit hotels or restaurants.  The Orania.Berlin did not disappoint.  In fact, it was one of the cleanest hotels with the friendliest and most helpful staff that I've ever experienced.  The hallways and rooms looked brand new.  The front desk and concierge personnel, both day and night shifts were extremely helpful. The bar staff in the ground floor restaurant was also a pleasure and their nightly entertainment was outstanding,   I wish I could have stayed many more days and look forward to staying there again on my next visit to Berlin.  The hotel is a great value, in a…"
6146,We liked the hotel. The room was a bit small but ok. The service was good (we speak fluent German). The location is excellent. All of the point of interests were easy to reach. The breakfast was exceptionally good - 5 points!
6147,"This was the starting hotel for my tour and I took an extra night. Position for exploring Lisbon on one's own excellent if you are a walker. Rooms were small and I looked out at an unattractive central courtyard. However it was very quiet. Bed was comfortable, breakfast excellent. Generally it was a good 3 star hotel. Several choices for eating out nearby. Ver close to the metro if walking is not your thing."
6148,"I have to update my review because the WHOLE PLACE--restaurant scene is ABSOLUTELY GONE. I was astonished that there is NO lobby breakfast or meal possibility--just lite bite breakfast. And.....IF you think of any other meal, prepare to feel like you're in the dining cart of an Amtrak. You can take in a full priced meal in the 1/4 spaced bar area and it's just a cramped--negligible atmosphere. I am not giving a bad review. They are renovating. I used to go to the venue and if felt like LUXURY through and through which is why I SO ranted and raved. But,of someone shows up there now they will not see any thing even remotely similar to what I described previously. The whole lux of the place is...gone"
6149,I have stayed at the Pestana Casino Hotel twice. The public areas are fine and the dining room stunning with panoramic views of the sea. Unfortunately money has not been spent on the bedrooms which are jaded and old fashioned. The lack of sockets is a pain in this day and age when most people have electronic devices to charge. Also having a socket close to a mirror would be a bonus so that hair straighteners could be used in comfort. The rom are super clean and the linens fresh. New towels would be super as those we used were thread bare.
6150,"Very smart hotel, within walking distance of Alexanderplatz, museums & Hackescher Markt. Good range of bars & eateries nearby. U-Bahn station directly opposite hotel. Comfortable bed, clean bathroom & good air conditions."
6152,"Had 2 nights here. Chatlottenburg. Excellent. Within walking distance to Deutsche Opera with its excellent restaurant. Twin room had good space , lovely midern bathroom , good lighting and Powerpoints , tea & coffee making facilities , good access via lifts. Room 147 was very quiet for an excellent sleep. Very warm and ckean linen. Nice big window. Indoor heating was excellent with separate timed heating in the bathroom. Good shampoo soaps etc.. free coffee & water downstairs .  We didn't eat bfast here as it was €15 though room looked nicely set up.  Very  modern & ckean with modern decor  off street level entrance. Grocery just across the road , easy walj to ubahn. Can store luggsge here. Check in 1500 & check out 1200. Would stay again. Check in was swift and friendly.  I had…"
6153,"Staff réelle OK, good location, easy to find, well furnished, supermarket nearby. Good pizzeria S. Martino at 5 minutes. But it's a little noisy. People aren't very respectful and the isolation is not very good. It was the only wrong point. "
6155,"Negative: I have to call the reception desk to turn off the AC unit in my room!  Call the desk for turning off air conditioning...  Maybe I am picky, but this is a little bit too much for me.  During 3 nights stay once I have to remind the desk that our room was not cleaned in the morning despite the fact that we were our for several hours and ""please clean my room"" indicator was on.  I have no proof, but I suspect that my rented car got a scratch while it was parked in the hotel (valet parking for EURO 22 per day).  It is a 5* hotel but not all toiletries (like tooth brash, tooth paste, etc.) were available (I know - maybe I could have called the desk and everything would have been delivered, but we had everything in Avenida Palace in Lisbon with no extra effort).  One of the…"
6156,We loved the light and quiet room overlooking the street and the big comfortable bed. The décor was simple and very tasteful in white and pastel shades. The WiFi was strong and the staff were friendly and helpful. The breakfast room was pleasant and the buffet was kept well stocked and the coffee was good. A short walk from the metro and easy walk to Gare du Nord. Definitely recommend this hotel for a Paris stay.
6157,we checked into room 2204 at the first begining. drop down the luggage and then we were out for dinner. when we got back tovthe room. the glass shelf in the washroom brokeand the glass was all over the washroom. we called front center nad took picture of the mass . the only answer we got from the staff is that it is not our fault and we get to change to another room. thiw is the worst experience ever. the 2 kids were scared and we have to tidy up everything again to change room. the staff didnt confort us or apologize . it seems that we borthered them . luckily  no one was in the washroom otherwise the hotel will face a law suit for sure. 
6158,My hopes for a hotel in a big city  are:         1. A spacious room         2. A clean and nice bathroom          3. Good beds          4. Crispy bacon and firmly scrambled eggs (not ‘egg soup’) for breakfast  Berlin Hotel Mitte scored to my satisfaction on all points 😍
6159,"The Hotel is located within walking distance of Brandenburg Gate, Museums, Church and Eastern Berlin. Very clean and Good rooms. Excellent breakfast. Front Desk very helpful. Train / Tram Station is within walking distance for convenient commuting."
6160,I apid over a $1000 for two nights stay to be M put in a room with AC that didn't work n.v in an active construction zone. Nothing like getting woken up at 6 am by hammering outside your room.  Staff did nothing to fix the problem. Crummy old motel. Stay somewhere else!
6161,"2 girlfriends and I had reservations for one night (last night) we checked in at 3:00 And that went very smooth! We loved the building, the open spaces and the room! We got back from our concert around midnight. People were being extremely loud, so we decided to stay up for a while and talk. People were still being extremely loud at 2:15am, screaming, singing, laughing......here it is 4:53am and people are still extremely loud, clucking in the hall like chickens and slamming doors. This is a cool place during the day but you won't get any sleep here. Terribly saddened no one comes to check that people are quiet in the middle of the night. And I have a 3 hour drive in a few hours."
6162,"I was actually quite surprised to find such an amazing hotel at such a good price, right in the city center - but it fulfilled every expectation for the solo traveler. New, refurbished rooms, comfy beds, everything that you need to get a good night's rest. Bathrooms new and spotless, breakfast was included and was more than generous (I did arrive early to avoid the busy 9-10 AM time).  The staff at the reception was more than helpful, with a special ""Thank You !"" for the young lady that was there in the morning (didn't catch her name, but really helpful and always smiling !).  The only questionable thing is a 50 EUR deposit upon arrival that was a bit of a surprise, but it was returned to my credit card ~6 hours after checkout."
6163,"Since I was arriving late the night I checked in and have to catch a plane the next morning, very early, I was looking for a simple room in a good location. This hotel fits the bill and it even has a sauna and gym which was great cos I get to use the Sauna. There was free minibar but since I do not consume alcohol, I only drank the water which was also good. In the minibar there were 2 bottles of beer, 2 bottles or wine, 2 bottles of juice and 2 bottles of water.  As I overheard at the reception, they refill this every day too. Hotel room even had a water boiler so I can make my own hot drinks. There is also a safe which is great. Only caveat is the room is very small, that I kept knocking myself and there was hardly any room to open my suitcase. But it is super clean,nice…"
6164,"I recently returned from Paris after a 6-day stay at the Max hotel.  I did a lot of research both on TripAdvisor and Expedia before I selected this hotel. I loved the Max hotel.  The design of the hotel is modern with attention paid on how to effectively utilize space.  My room never felt small because of the effective storage in the room.   My room was light and airy with a lot of light when the drapes were open.  Room darkening drapes will keep any late sleepers happy.   The bed was extremely comfortable with good linens and great pillows.  One of my favorite things about the room was the wooden floors which is very important if one has asthma or allergies.   This was the first hotel I stayed in Paris that had more than enough electrical outlets to charge devices, etc.  Nice…"
6165,"I recently stayed at Hotel da Musica  for a few days.  The hotel is very modern and clean, and located near the Casa da Musica metro stop.  The hotel is a 20 minute walk to the center of town and 15 by subway.  The room was clean and large, but poorly designed.  The sink spilled over, and the shower was outside the bathroom, resulting in a wet floor.  The air conditioning was very weak and could not be controlled in the room.  The wifi was good.    The service was inconsistent.  Some of the employees at the front desk were very helpful, while others were not.  The young lady working the afternoon/evening weekend shift was very helpful and friendly (apologies for forgetting her name!)  Overall, it is a well located but average hotel with a bit of a business hotel feel.    "
6166,Disappointed with this hotel since they would not honor my HHonors Diamond status.  Receptionist and hotel manager would not give access to the Executive lounge since I did not book through their internet site.
6167,Small rooms but everything you need.  Full mini bar. Front desk staff was very friendly and helpful but I can’t say the same for the restaurant staff.  Two morning in a row the server was rude to me/ignored me when they learned I didn’t speak German!  But a very nice hotel ...
6169,"From the elegant check-in (""let's sit down and can I bring you a drink?"") I felt very taken care of and even a little spoiled. The mostly young and friendly staff helped me find parking, restaurants, directions, rides, public transportation, and specific souvenirs during my stay on this beautifully modern property. I'll admit I was in not critical/happy tourist mode, but this hotel kept giving me lovely surprises: large room, comfy bed, electric adapters supplied, jazz concert in the lobby, the view from my room, the Olympic size bathroom, and the breakfast was one of the best I've ever had. I can't wait to go back."
6172,"This property has everything to make your stay comfortable enough, friendly staff. I would like say ""OBRIGADO"" particularly to Olga who had help us a lot with our plans, airline check-in etc. However, there are things to improve. Internet is terrible, breakfast could offer more vegetables."
6173,It is easy to find and close to Metro Grand Boulevard. Very imprssive friendly staffs at he reception made me fell at home. Decoration is wonderful colors. The lift with the glass is amazing and can see inside and outside the hotel. Free breakfast and free mini bar are unbelievable. The room is so clean especially toilette very shiny. You can leave your suitcase at the reception area. It is only 3 stars but I feel like 5 stars. 
6174,"Hotel Martinez is demonstrating what a 5-star luxury hotel is all about. Excellent location, great facilities, professional and pleasant staff in ALL departments and fantastic Food & Beverage options with top quality."
6175,"Where do I start.  STAY AWAY.  Booked through express travel on priceline.  Price was okay until they told us its an additional $120/ per night to request double beds instead of a single.  Bait and switched us when most hotels offer it if it is available.  Free wifi-doesn't work.  Toilet was running randomly all night.  Room is small.  Credit card was charged and then we were called on the room phone multiple times to come down and present with a card again because of their errors when charging.  When we asked to speak with a manager to voice our frustrations, front desk clerk seemed very irritated and was very rude.  Never again."
6176,I chose this hotel as it is close to Poblenou which is an area that I like in Barcelona. The service was good and the room clean and comfortable. It is close the amenities and the Metro. The beach is close by and the views are great!
6178,"the location is great, near transportation, the sites and a grocery store. The room as more of an apartment and was large and clean and nicely furnished with lots of natural light and 2 balconies. The only downside is the lack of a good concierge. "
6180,"My partner and I stayed for a single night and were fairly unimpressed.  The first thing we noticed was the apparent rudeness of nearly all the staff in comparison with everywhere else we stayed in Vietnam. We were only greeted once during our entire stay (by the porters) - all other staff either ignored us or stared at us without talking.  The room was tidy and the bed was decent, but we were unable to sleep very well as housekeeping staff were moving furniture in the room above us in the early hours of the morning. The housekeepers also began making up the rooms opposite us at 6:30 in the morning without any care for discretion, throwing things loudly and yelling down the hallways at one another.  We had both dinner and breakfast in the restaurant. Dinner was ridiculously…"
6181,"At the downtown area, many restaurant nearby. The walking street also near by. The Hotel no allow for early check in and I have to hang around for 4 hours. The breakfast only start after 7am and not suitable for those have to start travel 7:30am to work. The air conditional unable to set the temperature."
6182,"I stayed at this hotel numerous times but this given trip I stayed in the presidential suite and then another high grade suite. The rooms were incredible! The restaurant on the main floor of building 2 is great and the top floor lounge of the main building is very cool and always buzzing with people as well.   Negative things about this hotel is the staff. I was always spoken to very rudely, as if I am being done a favor, upon switching rooms it took me 3 hours to wait for it after the check out time, this is with me being a Platinum Elite Ambassador level member. We also left our jacket at the bell boy downstairs and upon returning he wasn't there, we caught him walking out asking where the jacket is and he said I finished my shift and walked out. We found it in one of the…"
6183,"We arrived at 12.15 to be told that we had a nice superior room with a side river view. On pointing out that we had reserved a suite with a full river view, we were then told that was correct but the room was not yet ready. Fair enough so we decided to have lunch whilst we waited. At 2.15 we asked again and were told we had a superior room with side river view booked, again advised them of their mistake and again showed them our confirmation for a suite with river view. Asked again at 2.45 and told that the room was not ready as check in was not until 2.00; pointed out that it was now 2.45. Again told we had booked a superior room! Finally shown to our suite with river view at 3.00, except the luggage was taken to another room! Why could they not just admit their error over the…"
6184,"Had a poor experience while I stayed here a few days back. Location - too far away from the city. A toll booth just before the hotel location is a major inconvenience  Service - Average at best. The staff is not very courteous. Definitely not the kind of hospitality one would expect at a 5star  Upkeep- I stayed in 2 different rooms during my stay. Both were poorly maintained. Pictures attached  Food -  This is the only area where this place shines. The breakfast spread is just amazing. Worth a trip there for a Sunday brunch.  Swimming pool- decent. But right next to the conference halls. It would be really uncomfortable to go swimming if there is a convention going on.  Verdict - Too far, poor connectivity, poor hospitality. Great food though!"
6185,Staff is very slow.  Room height / clearance is very low.  Old hotel.  Needs renovation.   Breakfast is strictly okay .  Sharon at the front desk was the best of all ... she was very helpful and courteous.   Location is also okay ... 
6186,We booked 2 nights in Chicago for a close friend's wedding taking place at the hotel. We booked 2 nights. When we arrived for our check in they told us we had no room since our reservation was made for the previous night. They had us for Friday and Saturday instead of Saturday and Sunday. Since we did not show up when they had mistakenly booked us - we flew in and had always planned a Saturday check in - they offered no apology and said it was our fault. It was embarrassing to be treated so poorly in front of our friends - who were also checking in at the same time. The front desk person also told us we had to pay for both nights!!! What? They did not have a room - but insisted we pay! They could not have been ruder. We called our American Express concierge who immediately…
6187,"I’m not normally fussy about the welcome I get from hotel reception but in this instance the lady looked rather surprised by my arrival and behaved as though she couldn’t find my reservation which was rather unnerving! I was initially shown the wrong (and cheaper) room despite handing over my reservation paperwork which clearly indicated the room type.   When I was eventually shown to the right ""superior"" room I discovered that it was very small room and I therefore had difficulty in opening my large suitcase (quite why they gave me such a small room when there were other larger ones available I don't know. They did offer to move me but by then I had unpacked and I didn't feel it was worth it). There was a large chest of drawers, large cupboard and a tiny table with a small old…"
6189,"Would probably given 3.5 not 4.   Positives :-  Location - excellent, walking distance to several of the markets, close to transport links and walking to main tourist attractions Room - cathedral view - well worth paying for.  Bar area - really nice, although aquarium currently under renovation the bar area is nice to sit and relax  Breakfast - fine - reasonable choice without being exceptional WiFi - worked well throughout the hotel   Negatives:-  Bizarre service at breakfast with nobody directing to tables, no system in place to be clear which tables were occupied or not, and it was busy. Coffee machine didn’t work in room and although we asked for it to be fixed on three occasions, it wasn’t  Gym - could do with some new equipment - small and dated   Overall would recommended…"
6191,"Unfortunately we stayed after an experience at NH Jousten same city. Although it seems to be 5 stars hotel, it is not.  The explanation from the reception desk after the stay didn't convince me at all. Small room, poor WIFI, no amnesties (toothbrush, shoes, coffee machine)....and quite ugly design.  I do recommend in this conditions NH Jousten!!!"
6192,"It must be a candid camera. I don't believe such a beautiful hotel in center of Buenos Aires can let guests in room in such conditions. See the pictures. Not cleaned , very dusty and damaged. I really hope they shape up. After a long day and flight I want to rest. Let see tomorrow "
6193,"This is a lovely independent hotel within minutes of the main Parisian attractions via the nearby Metro station. The surrounding area itself is very attractive with a large public park with lakes just five minutes away. Our room was clean and tidy, albeit a bit on the small side, and the hotel does not offer evening restaurant or bar facilities, but there are plenty of  very good brasseries nearby to compensate for this. We will definitely visit again, but will pay for an upgrade to a superior room."
6194,"Very nice Designer Hotel, however the focus is rather in “theater” Design than on Hotel.  On arrival there was a group of ladies checking in , so obviously that takes time. However 4 employées behind the bar were fighting with systems , an ownership change (?) from February so took very long to fix all. I asked two additional clerk standing there for a glass of wine. Whilst they had nothing to do and saw the hassle their advise was “try at the bar” instead of getting us some.  30 min later after check in we took the room, all very dark in the hotel, but we found it . Nice room, good beds, but very little space for luggage or to store the amenities in the bathroom. Again design over function. Only two plugs for electricity.  Breakfast was good. Dinner was ok, but service somewhat…"
6195,"I stayed here with my Girlfriend for two nights in march 2019 and enjoyed the stay very much. We flew into Nice airport and got a train from Nice St augustin to Cannes, the journey was about 40 mins and only cost about £5 each one way using the trainline app.  The location was perfect, 5 minute walk from cannes train station and 5 minutes from the sea front with plenty of restaurants and a supermarket not far either. The room was clean and tidy when we arrived, had all the basics you would expect from a good hotel room, hairdryer, mini fridge, shampoos/body washes, a safe and decent wifi. There was a small balcony with double doors that opened fully inwards, full bathroom which was very modern and clean.  Staff were all lovely and very helpful which was good considering you had…"
6196,"one night in may 2015 on my  way to the azores, i have to leave the hotell 6,00 in the morning.  the hotel forget to wake me up, the shover  and the toilet in two separate  room in the hall just inside the door, you  also wash your hans in the hall."
6197,"We were very pleasantly surprised by the size of the room, which was quite large by Paris standards.  The bath had a large rain shower head mounted in the ten foot ceiling as well as a hand shower.  The unusual thing was that the sink and shower are in one room and the toilet in another, as well as a bonus room to put your luggage.  The room was quiet and clean.  It did not have a view but when you walk outside and look down the street you can see the Eiffel Tower.  There is front desk staff 24 hours and they were all very nice.  Close to Metro, a grocery store/pharmacy and of course, restaurants.  Our room looked just like the photo."
6199,"Loved the location right near central Station so easy to navigate from there.The room was tiny for two adults and the bathroom very tiny, very basic no frills, the room is only suitable for a single person as very cramped for two. The price wasn't cheap due to location. No food eaten at hotel so can't comment on food. Loved Amsterdam, managed to get around the city to different districts and explore. Recommend the Hilton Hotel roof top bar for cocktails which gives you a fabulous city view while enjoying your drinks."
6200,"My boyfriend and I went here only for the spa, as their partner hotel The Vintage was renovating their spa. We were quite disappointed to learn upon arrival that they didn't have any pools at all - we both brought swim wear, which was then completely unneccesary. In addition, the saunas were in the changing rooms, so it was not possible for us to be in the same sauna, I only spent 5 minutes or so in the sauna due to this, as I was completely alone there. The saunas were also very small. So we didn't have the spa experience for a couple as we had imagined. We had both booked the Sports massage treatment, which was quite nice. I also booked the Beauty treatment for feet, which I think had the wrong name - I was thinking about getting the pedicure, but I chose this instead, due to…"
6201,"The hotel is well located in Barcelona in less than 10 minutes walk to bus and metro station. It's 10 minutes away from Plaza Glories, a shopping plaza with McDonald's, Burger King and Carrefour and also a lot of other restaurants in it.  It's less than 10 minutes walk to Torre Agbar.   You have a shopping mall in about 10 minutes drive called Diagonal Mar. The beach is about 20 min away on foot. The rest of top Barcelona atractions such as Sagrada Familia are mostly about half an hour away or 10-30min drive based on traffic.  The rooms are spacey and clean and the staff are helpful. The breakfast area is very nice and and the variety is fine. The hotel is more like a vacation hotel with very large lobby which is rare among Ibis hotels."
6202,"We didn't realize that this hotel offered a full club service as an included benefit of our stay here. It was a lovely surprise and gave us a welcome opportunity to get out of our room and into an appealingly spacious and well appointed lounge. A welcome drink was provided free and a generous spread of local produce for the guests to choose from. It was all delicious and was constantly replenished by the friendly, cheerful staff who are a joy to deal with. Breakfast was also included in the already reasonable tariff and it was also fresh and tasty fare. The rooms are very comfortable and creatively appointed and the beds were comfy and had good quality linen sheets and feather pillows. The welcome we received from all the staff was particularly outstanding.  Everyone working at…"
6203,"It is in a trendy area with little or no parking so at least one lane of traffic is cars parked with hazards on.  No place to park while you check in.  $40 overnight valet parking on a weekday (REALLY!!!)  The bathroom door is frosted glass, so EVERYONE waked when one person goes in the middle of the night.  Heat that blew out cold air half the time directly on the bed."
6204,"During our 5 day stayed at the Excel Suites, the staff and management team was courteous and eager to help. I was there to do a fashion runway during the Canne Film Festival, involving many moving parts with deliveries and my team coming in and out.   The accommodations were clean and spacious. The view from our balcony was one of my favorite ways to start the day. The management staff was extremely helpful with directions, information and hands on help to ensure we had a pleasurable time during our stay. The Excel Suites is just a 15 minute walk down a quaint street to both the train station and the beach with plenty of shopping.  I would highly recommend these wonderful suites to anyone wanting to find the perfect accommodations in Cannes. I look forward to returning next year…"
6205,"Location is ok a little far from the city center .The building is a little on the old side. However staff is really nice and helpful. Rooms are clean but old as well. I wish the gym was more up to date, small and not too many machines. We had dinner in their restaurant but nothing special ."
6206,"This hotel is gorgeous. The lobby, room and bathroom are all well designed and modern. The rooftop bar is exceptional, and I recommend visiting even if you’re not staying at the hotel. Check in was a breeze, the staff were absolutely lovely and I was expecting service to be consistent throughout our stay.  Upon requesting an ice bucket and wine glasses (there is an ice machine on the 7th floor and only water glasses in the room), we were informed there would be a service charge. Strange, considering most decent hotels are happy to provide extra glassware with compliments. Furthermore, upon requesting a corkscrew, the concierge stated that I would need bring the bottle down to the restaurant to have it opened or pay another service charge. I was surprised at his rude tone, but…"
6207,"Do not let pictures fool you on hotels.com  Just booked this last minute for an over night stay.  Location is fantastic!!  The actual hotel is OK.. the rooms are so SMALL its unreal, I asked for a bigger room to which they would have given me a free upgrade but the hotel was full, so they gave me a free mini bar ( 1 kitkat, bottle of water, a beer and something else)  which they did not have to do.  Good wifi, bed was comfy but again... do not book the standard room if you have lots of luggage, its decent for a quick over night stay if you are in transit.  Staff very friendly!"
6208,"I wouldn’t return to this hotel. It was very convenient for my office but not for the rest of town, which is at least 30 minutes away in a taxi. The room was fine, and clean.  Front desk staff weren’t the best I have had. The lobby is deserted and there is almost nowhere to sit, staff are milling around aimlessly. The gym has no water available unless you are prepared to pay.  The spa massage was not what I ordered but the language barrier meant I couldn’t communicate this. The evening restaurant staff are particularly poor, service was atrocious. And the restaurant was almost empty. I didn’t get the advertised welcome drink.  The activities didn’t happen as advertised.  There are almost no guests and no atmosphere. Breakfast was good.  But this is not a 5 star hotel in terms of…"
6209,"When I get into my room the toilet brush was still inside the toilet, they offered me a double bed but no, it was two individual beds, so you have to be careful with these details to offer a better service."
6210,"It's an easy bus ride from Tegel airport or a E16 taxi ride to this quiet hotel on a leafy side street close to the temporary opera house and university. The breakfast room is bright and sunny with a pretty good breakfast buffet. Nice and helpful desk staff. The floors our room creaked and friends of ours were in the room right below. Everything was clean, reasonably contemporary furnishings, and airy."
6211,"A hotel cannot really be held accountable for badly behaving guests, but if you try to call reception because for one hour at 3am someone in the floor above or below had his music on at an insane volume level, it would be nice for someone to pick up the call, let alone do something about it. This is even more true if your own check-in after midnight was interrupted not less than three times because the receptionist had to accept in-room dining orders rather than giving you the key to your room. This service level is unbelievably bad, and room service knocking at 8am to throw you out just completed the picture. No wonder, they do not ask you about their service upon check-out. The hipster at reception, again, was on the phone anyway... Rooms are nothing special and somewhat plain…"
6212,"Reliable, comfortable, good value, friendly staff.  Stayed two nights on a business trip.  Wifi was a bit slow at peak times (early morning, 6 pm) but was adequate to check email and download podcasts.  Room had a refrigerator and safe.  Windows that opened.  My room faced the back, and was very quiet (except for excessive police helicopter activity at one point).  Hotel Luetzow is located on a quiet side street.  A bus stop for the 200 bus is just a block away, and a Netto grocery store is just two blocks away."
6213,"We booked a standard room. The staff was very nice and welcoming and the location is great. However the room and especially the bathroom was very dirty, even after the room service cleaned it in the morning:  - on the night stand there was also a little cardboard with a gum left on it...  - for the bathtub, we were kinda feeling dirtier after taking a shower - In the bathroom there was a hole in the wall with naked electric cables  - fridge was not working  - very noisy air conditioner  - stains everywhere even on curtains   Please double check the rooms before your guest check in .. or change your room service staff !"
6215,"The only thing going for this hotel is location, otherwise it's pretty shabby and not in the chic way. The hotel room was not cleaned before our arrival and when we went to complain we were told we would be unable to change rooms because we had used the restroom. Additionally our ""city view"" from the window was directly into another room. The hotel itself was fairly noisy, both during the day and night. Upon check out the phone system was down so we were unable to call down to the front desk to request our call from valet. When we arrived to the front desk to check out and get our car the front desk attendant stated he would call for our car. We waited outside as we were instructed.. My boyfriend checked in twice with the front desk each time promising that the car was on its…"
6217,"I stayed at this Hilton last week and was very disappointed in the entire experience. The lobby is run down, as well as the rooms. They were having some private party, so the main restaurant was closed. A mini-buffet at a lower price was offered in the lounge area. The staff manning the buffet stations were rude and aloof. I realize that as an American staying at their hotel, they may not be used to seeing Westerners. But there is no excuse for not offering the typical Hilton hospitality. And to top it off, the beds are hard and the towels are worn out. Next time I am in Shanghai staying near the train station, I will stay somewhere else."
6218,We recommend this hotel. The best of it: the nice decoration and atmosphere in the lobby. Correct service. Good breakfast with excellent local food...and that's all...why have I to write 200 characters minimum?...sometimes less is more!
6219,"Hotel is in a great location, near museums and cuty center, however it feels and looks dusty. Staff was professional, but could be more friendly. Rooms are quite small and tight. The hotel didn't have hot water one morning, but it was quickly fixed."
6220,"This was a great boutique-type hotel in a wonderful location - just a couple of blocks from the Eiffel Tower. The rooms are comfy and spacious for Europe, all though the bathroom was a tight squeeze. The staff is friendly and there are tons of great restaurants in the area."
6221,"If you're looking for a cost effective clean bed for the night, this does the job. The room is clean, the water hot and the shower pressure good. My window was small and didn't open. Air con was good however. It lacks charm and any sense of quality and apart from the newly refurbished lobby and restaurant area, the decor is tired. The gym is ill-equipped with one running machine, cross trainer and rowing machine - 1 set of free weights. At peak times - between 7-8am you've got no chance of getting on a machine, so go early to avoid disappointment. The outside pool looked nice but is closed until April.  The staff are friendly and helpful, the breakfast is very good with a wide range of options.  Location wise - 15-20 mins cab ride from the airport and 10 mins cab to the city…"
6222,"The room was basic but comfortable and clean. The shower was very good, The staff are excellent, very pleasant and helpful. The location of the motel is superb and all major sights are within walking distance. There is also a taxi rank and an underground station right outside the front door. The breakfast was very good value for money. Would definitely use this hotel again and would also check out if this chain is in any place I will visit in the future."
6224,"We have recently returned from a 3 night stay here and it was honestly so lovely.  Upon arrival we were greeted bu reception who were very helpful, providing us with a map and some information about what was close by.  My Boyfriend had a bit of trouble booking the hotel on booking.com and explained it has sort of ruined my Xmas present surprise so they upgraded us to a top floor apartment.  The apartment itself was lovely and clean, spacious and having the added bonus of the kitchen was a nice touch even though we didn't use it other than for tea making. The room was cleaned daily, beds made and towels changed however we did have to change one of the bins ourselves as it was missed but not a problem. The location is perfect, 4 mins walk to the Metro station that takes you to the…"
6226,"My family and I booked this hotel and stayed here at the start of October. Our first impression on check in was great and this set the scene for the rest of stay. We booked two rooms, one of which got up graded to a Seaview room based on my platinum status with IHG which my parents enjoyed, even though they were told that the room was small it was perfect according to them. We booked a junior suite which was huge with a balcony but the only negative was it was situated at the back of the hotel with a small sea view and some small noise from the trains..but you can only here this when the balcony Door was open. My disappointment was that I paid to have one for the better room category and it was stuck at the back but the size made up for it plus we were. It in our room much. Like others have said the beach is two minutes across an over bridge and the town is just a 20 min walk along the beach pathway. We where lucky enough to get a car park on the road to the side of the hotel so saved money on parking. Breakfast was great. I have stayed in many many hotels over the years and it the people that make the difference. This hotels has great staff with nothing being an issue, the basics of hospitality but these guys shined above our expectations …"
6227,"I really wanted to write a good review of this hotel, and there were many positives, but the negatives outweighed the good during my stay.  I travelled as a single business traveler, and upon arrival check-in was quick. I arrived at the hotel at 10:15pm, and the person at reception could not even offer a smile. I had to ask about the breakfast facilities, which were included in my stay, as he did not offer this information.  Anyway, I got my keycard and headed to my room. Upon entering the room, the first thing I noticed was that it contained twin beds. Yes, they were pushed together, but there was a gaping hole between the two beds, which would have made it impossible to function as a double bed.  As tired as I was from the long trip, I immediately made my way back down to…"
6228,"I just spent three nights here (8/13-8/16) for over $750/per night and it was terrible. I would never stay here again.  this place is not what it used to be.  first, on Sunday check in at 4:15 pm the receptionist told the person in front of me that his room was not ready. when the person started to tell me that my room was not ready i told him that for $800 a night and at 4:15pm, my room had better be ready. Lo and behold my room was available--but indeed not ready. Upon entering the room, the sofa bed was pulled out and the room was otherwise disorganized.  rather than call housekeeping, i folded it myself.  Then on Monday morning at 6:30 while getting ready to shower for my meetings there was no hot water. Upon calling reception, i was told that it was coming on. 30 min later,…"
6231,Check in was quick and easy. €30 block on your card for potential damage. Mini bar is free & fully stocked and replenish daily. No alcohol unfortunately though. Beds 3 out of 5 for comfort. Shower & bathroom 4 out of 5. Breakfast sounds costly but with champagne included could be a treat. We found a cafe around the corner which was reasonably priced. The dark ambiance of reception and bar area is relaxing. Electical scooter’s for free for a deposit but must be booked. Free umbrellas at hand if raining. 2 min walk from the U Bahn. All in all it was a pleasant stay. 
6233,I booked this hotel for my husbands 60th Birthday. I was not disappointed. The hotel is situated in an ideal area to visit all the sightseeing areas. The hotel itself is chic and the breakfasts were first class
6234,"The hotel is beautiful from the outside and lobby and is on a small beach surrounded by cliffs. It takes 15mins to walk to the centre of town. We were disappointed at the breakfast. It had a range of Portuguese heavy bread that took 10mins to toast, cold scrambled eggs and tin frankfurts. The coffee was good and there was a selection of cold meat, fruit and cereal.   The studio rooms are tiled And cleaned daily. Walls are thin and could hear snoring. Doors do not lock behind you.  Staff recommended good restaurants. Great roof top pool.  Great if u prefer the quiet bay beaches."
6235,A lovely small hotel in city of Paris . 5 minutes walk to the Moulon Rouge . The rooms aren't large but are very nice . The staff are very friendly and helpful with Restuarant's and places to visit . The staff are so good that they found a necklace in our safe and quickly rang and posted it back to our house . I would recommend staying here . We will stay here again . Thanks Le Grey hotel 
6236,"Absolutely beautiful hostel in a wonderful area of Berlin! The rooms are huge! It's hotel-like. Big lounge for people to search the internet and hang out near reception. The breakfast is a good deal and allows for people to meet one another, also. Mitte is an outstanding area of the city. Definitely recommend."
6237,"The hotel is fairly comfortable and has a good location, but it is let down by very poor service.  The staff is largely untrained and especially in the breakfast restaurant, it is difficult to get a cup of coffee.  Staff is not attentive - although there are plenty of them standing around doing apparently nothing.  Also getting a taxi in front of the hotel is an ordeal.  There are plenty of staff standing around who are unhelpful and inattentive and do not seem to be capable of organizing and communicating clearly to the taxi drivers.  I have asked the Hotel Manager if they can try to add decent muesli to the breakfast buffet, as I have stayed there many times.  He said he would ""look into it"".  Nothing was done.  The concierge was not able to recommend a good restaurant in the…"
6238,"Stayed for 2 nights In this Lovely hotel, there were good, clean spacious rooms.  The only issue we could find wine rooms was there was no tea/ coffee making facilities.  The pillows were not that comfortable but found the hotel offered a pillow menu.  There was a bus stop just outside & along a main shopping street making it easy to get around the city.  Overall a pleasant stay."
6239,"I loved the hotel, but it is time for renewing, i would be giving a better score when they manage to do this. The staff is very kind and helpfull. The area and location is perfect. They are modernizing the surrounding area, renewing the roads and building more restaurants and shops on the road to the harbour."
6240,"This hotel is in a great location- near Notre Dame, walking distance to Jardin du Luxembourg.  Plenty of restaurants nearby and a close metro station.  We stayed on a floor with a shared shower but it wasn't a big deal.  The staff is what sets the hotel apart, though.  You do not feel like a customer- you are a guest."
6241,"We live in Vietnam and have seen a lot of crazy places so I can say this with confidence — our stay here was plain weird.   We arrived early afternoon on a Saturday -- taking a 600K VND Grab car from the Greenlines Ferry terminal in Vung Tau. On the surface, the place looks great. The pool is beautiful, the beach is long and deserted, the buildings seem in good repair.  But there was no one staying there. After a couple of hours it began to feel spooky.  We had booked rooms in the wooden houses overlooking the river but got upgraded to beach front villas at no extra cost. There was no explanation for the move although other friends later told us that they were moved to the beach because the less expensive rooms near the river had a rat problem. We saw no rats during our stay but we did not see the wooden houses either.  There was an extensive lunch menu although it became clear that only a few things were on offer. What we had was good value. Three of us ordered simple plates of stir fried beef, bean sauce pork etc and were stuffed at the end of the meal. The vegetables were crisp, fresh and delicious. Beer was available but there was no wine.  We had the pool to ourselves, of course. It's quite beautiful but a bit too shallow for serious swimming. Being early May, the water was luke warm -- as was the sea which we tried a bit later.  My wife and daughter thought the beach was littered in garbage but I think most of it had washed ashore. There were fishermen working the beach through the day but few other people around to actively litter the beach.  Compared to similarly priced beach resorts in Mui Ne and Phu Quoc, River Ray Estates Resort had few beach facilities. There were no lounge chairs. In fact the path from our beach house to the beach led straight to a three foot drop instead of to the stairs that were several meters away. The staff was friendly but were there for laundry and house keeping -- no beach maintenance. The cook had to be called in from her home when we wanted dinner because we were the only diners.  When we went for dinner, the outside dining room was swarming with mosquitoes so the staff offered to bring our food to our room -- we had a baby with us and were happy to shelter inside. Oddly though, there were no mosquito nets in the bedrooms which is quite rare in my experience.  Our free breakfast was NOT the continental promised on the website. The young waitress told us Sunday morning that they only had eggs, bread and coffee. No apology or explanation offered -- that was just the way it was.  The Medina villas were outdated as noted by other reviewers. The kitchens had no cutlery, cookware or dishes. But the fridges worked fine. The furniture was rudimentary but comfortable enough. There was a small dining table plus a sofa and coffee table in each suite. One bedroom had a Thai-style hard mattress while the other was soft and comfy. The AC worked great. The bathrooms were functional but 1960s ugly and stained.  At one point an older German guest with a dog walked by us on his way to the river walk and explained that there were no other guests because the units were all rented out to staffers working at the new casino down the road. But in our 21 hours here, we saw no sign of anyone -- no scooters, no people, no voices.  Maybe the new casino and other mega resorts in the area have killed off business at the River Ray and its neighbours. Too bad because it is a great setting. For now though, I recommend it for seasoned Viet travellers and I certainly wouldn't pay more than $50US a night. Expect to get upgraded to a much more expensive room near the beach. (If we had paid over $100 a night per room we would have been pretty unhappy.)  I found the stay amusing and enjoyed the peace and quiet. We had heavy rain in the evening and in the morning so didn't get a chance to really explore the beach or the river walk. Great view of the lightning storm over the sea though. My daughter (mother with baby) was visiting Vietnam for the first time and found the whole experience unsettling.  If you go, bring your own snacks and beverages and a sense of humour. I hope the owners find a way to get the business thriving again because it could be a beautiful place.…"
6242,Stayed for a long weekend in July 2016. Room was clean and comfortable albeit a little petit but perfectly adequate. Friendly helpful staff and good transport links at Moritzplatz just round the corner. Would certainly stay there again. The gin bar must be sampled!!
6243,"We came to this hotel despite some quite bad reviews online.... and it just seemed like  the W just cannot deliver what others do.   I will start by saying that this hotel is definitely an acquired taste. It seems to cater more for young and millennial crowds than it does for those with a conservative taste.   The hotel experience did not start well, with a mix up in my booking, and then with a series of events that unfolded after much communication over celebrations we were holding whilst visiting Amsterdam.   It comes across like this hotel struggles to communicate efficiently through its internal departments. It took 4 attempts at getting the right sized towels - I eventually gave up asking. The room service and amenities are ok although it does seem odd that the cleaning…"
6244,Great location to explore the city at a very reasonable price. Complimentary breakfast is great and staff is making the difference with their attitude. Rooms are spacious and nicely decorated. Clarins stationery makes the experience complete. You realy have to do your best to hear the nightclub as mentioned in some other reports.....
6245,"This is definitely not a 3 1/2 star hotel. It is overpriced, drab, tired and in urgent need of an upgrade.  We stayed here for 5 nights. The first night we didn’t get a wink of sleep due to the noise not just within the hotel, but outside as well. We booked an ocean view room which you could only just see. After not sleeping for the night, we approached reception to ask for a quieter room and were supposedly ‘upgraded’. This meant a higher floor.  It was a little quieter, and better views but still very drab, and the same layout and decor as our previous room. Again disturbed sleep due to loud music playing all night long, other noise and inconsiderate guests. The only redeeming factor is that it is close too the beach."
6246,"1st stay room with 5 step escalator, Not a good view 2nd stay room too small . Nice View to Avenue with treesService at restaurant very slow .Although they were very warm and educates when they served Service at check in slow also"
6247,"First things first, yes it is a budget hotel. But there is a budget hotel I've used before then there's this. For the price of being in Melbourne for 6 days it was within my money allowance. If it had a bit of renovation it would be up to a much better standard. Our room was not all that great. Carpet was coming up in areas, the walls had paint pulled off and was covered in scratch marks. The bathroom if it can be called that was a little corner of the room which was covered with a shower curtain around a very small sink area and then the shower next to it. The in room TV was broken and the Ariel connection was broken as well with it.  The Wi-Fi is terrible there do not buy any. The beds were comfortable though but it still didn't make up for it. The location is brilliant its a…"
6248,"I stayed for 5 nights in room 203 which is a 'tribal' room on the 2nd floor with a balcony over looking the street. The room was OK. The balcony was lovely.   I stayed in late November which should have been low season and paid about 150 EUR a night. Which I guess isn't too bad considering it's right off Rossio Square, but the room itself was nothing special. Not sure why it's a 'luxury' hotel. The room was very basic and small. The double bed was 2 single beds pushed together so you couldn't sleep in the middle properly. There were few plugs and no USB plugs, the carpet was really dirty and the bathroom was ridiculous. The shelf above the sink prevented you from washing your face over the actual sink so water went everywhere. The placement of the hooks in the bathroom was mind…"
6249,"Simple but nice hotel. Very nice staff.  Breakfast ok. Clean outdoor pool with about 5-6 sun loungers. Unfortunately our room and our friend's room was damp which is a huge 'no-no' for me - It had that musty, damp smell. Seriously bad for your health to be breathing that in all night :( "
6250,"quite an unpleasant stay, completely unusable wifi, overestimated rates, unjustified daily tax, not a very good customer service either. Problem of stains on a pillow upon arrival, and a discrimination incident from one employee. I would not recommend it."
6251,"You be the judge. I don't want to judge prematurely BUT... Bar was under renovation so this is the closet like room we were herded into for drinks.  No atmosphere, TV, anything on the walls, music, blah.  Didn't stop the drink prices from being $600 for a round, even at 25 drinks that's still around $25 a pop! Seriously?!  No thought of maybe realizing that $24 a drink may be steep for ""socializing"" in a room that brings to mind the word ""sanitarium""? That's OK, the wonderful view of the parking lot made it all worthwhile. "
6252,"The hotel is Ok. Large bedrooms, low end amenities. The breakfast is not great, but is not bad. Good location for those who enjoy a good walk, as I do. I DO NOT recommend the hotel if you're in business trip. The internet access at the bedrooms is the worst I've ever experienced. I've complained for 3 nights in a row and the answer was always the same: ""there is nothing we can do"". So I had to come to the lobby to have the possibility to work. My last complaint was replied with ""it's a free service!"". If you are not working, it's ok. If you depend on internet access for some reason, you probably should think about other options."
6253,"This hotel is fantastic!  It is in a great area of South Beach....very quiet and laid back.  We were able to walk everywhere.  The rooms are clean, the bathroom towels are soft and fluffy and everyone who works there is super friendly and helpful. I can’t give them 5 stars, though, because once I got home and saw the itemized bill I had a question.  There are 5 room charges and I can only account for 4 of them.  I have reached out to the hotel repeatedly over the last 2 weeks and no one will tell me what that fifth charge is for,  it might very well be mine but I want to know exactly what it is for.  In this day and age, with the sheer number of choices available to consumers, customer service is EVERYTHING.  I will never stay at this hotel again nor will I recommend it to any…"
6254,We have stayed in this hotel recently and it did not maintain the standard from our last visit in 2005. Rooms comfortable and clean. Overall we had fun and enjoyed our stay. Would recommend a room with a view.
6255,I've been there for 3 days for business trip and I recommend this hotel for business and for family. It's in the centre of Berlin very close to the business area and to the zoo International breakfast
6257,"Nice hotel, nice rooms, good breakfast but it’s currently a building site. And they start at 7 am on Saturdays and Sundays. By all means book this hotel but check first that they have finished building the extension they appear to be putting on the top floor. "
6259,"My husband and I stayed at Turtle Bay Resort in April of 2018 for 6 nights. We booked a Deluxe King Ocean View room on Expedia in January 2018. We had been in Oahu in November of 2015 and stayed in the Hilton in Waikiki at that time. Despite being a bit shy naturally, we had a fabulous time in the hustle bustle of Hilton Hawaiian Village in 2015.  This time we decided to stay near the North Shore because we were interested in less crowds and proximity to different places. We have close family on the island but prefer to have our own space on vacation and always stay elsewhere. All in all, we were very disappointed with our stay at Turtle Bay. We found the customer service and kindness of staff to be the worst we had experienced during any of our travels to the Hawaiian islands.…"
6260,"It's unfortunate that I have to rate this as poor because it is a good hotel. We had a good experience with initial check in / valet and the ocean view 1 bedroom suite was good as expected.   The problem is the bedroom of the suite (1721) is directly behind or adjoining the 3 elevators and the noise and vibrations from them made it very difficult to sleep, they were in full swing by 6am and in use till late. Sort of like a subway noise. I assume this problem exists in the same room on every floor.   I went down to reception the next morning to explain our problem and ask for a room change. I was asked no questions about the issue nor offered any apology, which makes me think it's a common complaint. I was told we couldn't be moved till the following day and then would have to…"
6261,"I recommend this hotel despite the lack of service. The hotel & guest rooms are beautiful & very comfortable. The shower was incredible.  The location is close to shopping, but a bit outside the main tourist areas. We appreciated the distance & didn’t mind taking public transportation. Multiple stations are each about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. We didn’t see many cabs, but we took Uber without difficulty.   We took a redeye and were very glad that a room was ready for us when we arrived at about 12:30 pm. The woman who checked us in was very sweet, but didn’t seem to know what to do. She erroneously thought we are Marriott Rewards Silver members. When I explained that we are Gold, she did not look for an upgrade. She also did not know how to switch the credit card we used…"
6262,"They offer you comfortable bed and good cleaning. There is no big lobby but even in that conditions they offer you to bring coffee while you are waiting for something. Cleaning was perfect but towels little bit old. If you need some info about city or want to talk about sports, politics, history find Eric.   Ps: room 35 bathtub floor is sleepery, im sure they will take care of it soon"
6263,"When we arrived we were sent away as the room wasn't ready - despite requesting early check in. When we eventually got a room key it was to a room on the 1st floor - we requested a high floor. When we arrived on the floor there was a tray of dirty pots at the side of the lift - they were there for 2 days!!  Upon arriving in my room I pulled back the duvet to find blood on my bed sheets!  The first night I was awoken 5 times by noisy guests - the final straw was at 4.40am by a group who were lay on the floor outside my room! Despite being on camera, and one girl having little clothing on and a member of her party struggling to get her from the floor no hotel staff came to help. Breakfast was horrendous - had to wait for items each morning resulting in other items going cold.…"
6264,"The hotel was in a good location, not too far from where we wanted to go. For what we paid we didn't expect a massive room however the rooms are very small, there wasn't much space to move around at all. Toilets are tiny with no window and the shower in our room had no curtain just a glass door so if you're going with someone you don't want to see you in the shower don't go!   Other than that couldn't fault the hotel, staff were helpful, rooms were clean and beds were comfortable, there's also a bowl of delicious sweets in reception that I couldn't help dipping into every time I passed.   "
6266,"A small retro hotel in a great location that has an atmosphere of being in someone's home rather than a hotel. Although our room was very small it was perfectly kitted out with everything that's needed - including a safe, free wifi, hair dryer and tea/coffee making facilities etc. The bed was  really comfortable too.   The staff are friendly and very helpful. Nothing is too much trouble! Really enjoyed our stay. Will definitely return. "
6267,I was staying here for the first part of my solo trip and wished I had chosen somewhere else to stay. The hostel was expensive for food and drinks and you couldn't drink your own alcohol or anything like that. It was in a nice area which was very easy to get to and the dorm room was ok but not the cleanest in the bathrooms.  It was difficult to meet anyone here as the social scene wasn't very good. I would choose somewhere else in future but this may be an ok place to stay with friends or a bigger group. 
6269,"This is an average hotel, with relatively spacious room compared to many hotels in Europe. You can walk to city center in 30 minutes. There are designer shops around. Rooms are clean and quite. Small reception area. My staj was just ok. "
6270,"The concierge is arrogant and of no help.  Air conditioner is noisy, but at least it does work.  They is most probably better places to say at the same price.  I wouldn't stay here again. Even contemplated moving hotels during my stay as so unhappy with the hotel staff."
6271,"Decent service and nice room although could use a little freshening. Staff nice. Concierge helpful.  Turn down didn't always come and when they did... If main dinner time is 9pm, why is turn down coming at 730pm - when I'm likely getting ready to go out to dinner? Shouldn't they come after 9pm, when I'm likely gone?  TV didn't work, service had to come, cord was disconnected by maid. Front desk slow. Front desk, 'we can upgrade you for $300 to penthouse that has 3 bdrm and 3 bath.' I say we will take it because we actually have 3 rooms reserved.  Oh, 'she replies then it will be $900 per night to upgrade.' Well which is it?  Then each room had a spending credit, but not offered to each - had to ask and then they disappeared in the back for a long time. Buffet breakfast nice. …"
6272,"A very normal hotel from the DoubleTree chain from Hilton. Good beds, reasonably amenities, normal breakfast... nothing amazing, nothing bad. I believe the breakfast could be better. The good thing: the staff is amazing."
6273,This small but very nice hotel is two blocks off the main street in central city and has one of the friendly staffs I have ever encountered.  Room are small but very well priced.  Clean room but limited storage for luggage.  Its location out weighs all other comments however due to being near the center of La Ramblia.  Many restaurants are in walking distance and so is the meeting points for most guided tours around town and the countryside.
6274,"We stayed here for 3 nights on our recent trip to Paris. When booking, they were running a deal that if you stayed 3+ nights, you could get a package that included breakfast. The breakfast was perfect for us and allowed us to get our day started early. They served an assortment of pastries, yogurts, hard boiled eggs, cheese, juices, and hot beverages. The staff at the desk were kind and helpful. Our room was very clean. The shower was one of the most spacious ones I have used in Europe, although there is no shower curtain, as others have mentioned. We put a towel on the floor and aimed the shower head downward and it wasn’t too bad. There is a hair dryer in the bathroom. I did notice the “smell” that other reviewers mentioned in the lobby when we first checked in, but did not…"
6275,"The hotel staff were ok, not rude but not necessarily friendly as well. The room was average it was on ground level with the view of the parking, it was clean though. The location was't so good as we though in the beginning, too far from everything, you definitely need a car to go around the island!!! The public transportation bus stop is far to walk, from Thira with a car took us around 30' with all the traffic and to go to Oia to see the sunset (the most popular village of the island) with all the traffic took us 1 hour!!! The worst part of our stay was that we had booked it with half board food ( breakfast and dinner included). I mean the breakfast was Ok nothing special though but the WORST part was their dinner. I mean they served us whatever they wanted only 3 courses,…"
6276,if i could give it a zero i would -- was lied to by front desk about a voucher and was asked for my phone number so the general manager could call me the next day and it's been 3 days and I still haven't received a call from the general manager. 
6277,"Check-in was slow. Like really slow. They were moving at glacial pace. I know it's Europe but after a red-eye and a connecting flight, you just want to get in.   Hotel was really cool looking. Lobby looked like it was in the future. Elevator was trippy as hell. They offered complimentary wine, which was nice.   Room: This was room was small. That is what I remember. It was tiny."
6278,"I have mixed opinions about this hotel, and it's hard for me to judge it in a fair manner just because it's not the kind of place I usually stay at. In terms of utilities, room quality, service, etc, Brooklyn Hotel is a pretty good place (although not exactly cheap). Its only problem is that it's located on the 'other' side of the main canal, so in order to get there you need to take a (free) boat ride each and every time, and not only it takes you quite a while (approx. 20 minutes, if I remember correctly) but it can be not obvious how to get there the first time.  I would recommend Brooklyn Hotel to people who want to enjoy a good view of the city port (if you get a high floor, that is), as well as to people who enjoys fancy modern hotels regardless of the location. I would…"
6279,"First oval I would like to start from positive, hotel has a nice design and since it's brand new it's clean... But is it enough to have good vacation? Well, definitely not! Room theoretically was the best one with sea view, but it means located very far from beach! I would prefer garden room which is next to beach than high, this was not specify on their website!  English is close to poor or absent at all in the hotel... Ordering food and had half of it missing, since Lady couldn't understand a word... Sea side at the hotel is worst one on the island, we cross all of it and Melia as most muddy water, not a case for nice beach. First day water was full of jelly fishes, but this is can not be controlled by hotel :) but their is no warning signs on the beach! Also water was sort of…"
6280,Do not stay here this hotel smells like piss and the room are veryyyyyy small. The toilet in the bathroom does not flush. There were stains all over the curtains. The carpet in the halls are dirty. They also charge to an extra 200 dollars for no reason. I just recently went here for my birthday June 26 and I had the worst experience of my life this hotel is more like a motel it's disgusting!!!!! Stay at the Catalina it's much nicer  that's the hotel I stayed at the first time I went to Miami but I wanted to try something cheaper but I made a huge mistake!!!!!
6281,nice place close to old town. nice and clean room. breakfast ok. restaurant for dinner is wonderful. nice wine menu.  just help the 2 trainees at the reception. the checkout lasts more than 20 minutes...painful  
6283,"The resort itself is very nice, some areas need a little sprucing up and to be cleaned a little better but overall it's nice.  My problem was with the management: they booked us into a room under construction.  Although construction time is supposed to be 9-5 we could hear people in the room as early as 5 and as late as 9.  One day they were breaking up the tile from the room above using power hammers, so loud we literally had to leave the room.  The manager had no place for us to go that was quiet.  This was supposed to be a week my wife could rest up for surgery, so much for that.  Construction is 7 days a week and don't be surprised if they start early and end late.  It would be easy to make a buffer zone between the construction and the guests, but they proved they don't…"
6284,Type of hotel between modern and classical with a good restaurant and bar with great cocktails directly on the spree river at 5 min walk from the first subwaystation. Very friendly and englh speaking staff 
6285,"My husband and I recently stayed at AMC Apartments in Berlin. We booked a studio apartment and were very happy with everything.  The gentleman at the reception desk was very friendly and nice.  The room was clean and fairly spacious for a studio.  It came equipped with a little kitchenette and an oven which came in handy when we did take away from the cafe downstairs.  The bed was very comfortable.  The bathroom was also quite spacious.  There was complimentary bottles of water available for use as well as umbrellas and an ironing board, hair dryer, etc.  We were very happy with our accommodations and would stay here again when in Berlin.  You could park in the garage next door but be sure to clarify where to go exactly.  It was a little confusing and we did wind up parking in…"
6286,"This hotel is well suited for visiting the Rijksmuseum and the Van Gogh Museum.  It is very basic---small bar of soap and towels, but it was clean and the breakfast was good served in a light  nicely decorated area.  The lift was very slow if more than one person wanted to use it."
6287,Parking: wonderful Entrance: Nice Reception: Professional Breakfast: Well assortment Internet: could be stronger and more stabil in reception and room area  Room: quiet and nice Bathroom: a bit to Little  TV: fine Loewe TV Table: to small for work-to-do in the room
6288,"Stayed here for two nights. Clean bathrooms and bed. Private locker/drawer. Good lounge area.  I didn't enjoy the stay as much as I did in other hostels, the AC is turned off during the day leading to very hot rooms, loud music was coming from the rooftop till late most evenings. Hostel does rent out bikes but they are very run down."
6289,"We went to Berlin for a few days. The staff greeted us with a drink/hot beverage of free choice and we were allowed to store our luggage until our room reservation kicked in. During our whole stay the staff met us with smiles and created a nice atmosphere overall. The lounge area offered computers, table football (foosball) and comfortable couches packed in cozy surroundings. The rooms were clean and modern and offered free WiFi.  Definitely worth the price 👍"
6290,The studio apartment was great in every way. We particularly liked the balcony and the well equipped little kitchen. The area was very quiet for such a central location. We loved the pool and sauna and made use of this every day. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend the Adina as a great place to stay.
6291,"We stayed 2 nights, yet again in China the air conditioning was not working, with much discussion we were moved to another room,we could not get the air conditioning below 24 which  was not comfortable.  They said there was no air conditioning in the hotel at the moment, it had been turned off.  Lots of people were complaining.  The reception just said open a window, it was very smoggy so that was not an option.  The beds were really comfortable.  In all the hotels we stayed in on our visit we had two double beds.  Our bathroom had a bit of mould.  Trying to get down from the 17 th floor for breakfast was impossible with people trying to leave with their luggage.  we used the staff elevator with great success, but don’t tell anyone.   The breakfast was excellent, great choice of…"
6292,"This was my third stay at the Hotel Comete, and it's just as good as ever, if not better. Having stayed in many hotels over the years, I can say that this is one of my two favourites (it's a close call as to which is best) and easily the best value hotel in a major city. Why? Firstly, the staff go out of their way to make sure everything about your stay is perfect. Secondly, the rooms which, while compact, are tastefully furnished, spotlessly clean and equipped with everything you might need, including a safe. Third, the modern bathrooms with rain shower. Fourth, added bonuses such as the espresso machines in every room, free bottles of water, and fresh macaroons on the first night. Fifth, the excellent breakfast with fresh croissants, breads, beautiful scrambled eggs, cheeses,…"
6293,"The rooms are nicely appointed and the A/C works well, an important point in Salvador but the restaurant sucks. We checked in about 7:30 pm and went to get dinner at the restaurant immediately after taking our bags to the room.   Relatively simple menu, which is fine, but the problem was in the execution.  We ordered one hamburger and two sandwiches, all with french fries.  It took almost an hour to get the first part of our order.  All of the entrees were lukewarm or cold.  The grilled vegetable and cheese sandwich had cold broccoli, cauliflower and carrots in it that appeared to have been frozen.  The cheese was congealed to the bread.  It literally was not edible.   A man in a chef's hat was standing in the restaurant talking with two other people during the whole time we…"
6294,"Been here several times before. Good hotel, nice modern rooms. Beautiful view over the city if you’re on the higher floors. Subway Wittenbergplatz is only 1 minute away. Pity the rooms cannot open a little bit for fresh air but the airconditioning works ok. Photo’s from room 1721. "
6295,"This hotel is somewhat removed from downtown, with some restaurants and businesses nearby.  The staff was friendly and their English was excellent.  The room was contemporary with 2 chairs for relaxing.  The free morning buffet was excellent, well above what is typical in US hotels.  We would stay there again if we return to Barcelona."
6296,"I had booked a room through the site for 3 nights. I called to change the check in date 2 days prior to my arrival which I was told was done. When I called the next day to cancel my reservation, I was told that first of all, I was only booked for 1 night instead of 2. And then they told me they could not change the reservation because it was booked through Expedia. I looked at my history in Expedia and I have not used that service in over 2 years. A call to Expedia confirmed that I had NOT used Expedia to book this room. I then called the hotel back and I was told I was not in their system at all and that the person must have cancelled it. The reservation number I was given does not exist. I asked ""Are you sure I have no rooms reserved?"" and was told yes. Imagine how upset I was…"
6297,The hotel is really convenient for a stop over near the airport.  The rooms are a little on the small side but perfectly clean and good value for money.  The staff were incredibly helpful and friendly.  The hotel even has a guest kitchen and there is a supermarket within easy walking distance. The breakfast was lovely and just what we needed before carrying on with our journey.
6298,"While the property itself is good, the experience of dealing with the staff is just terrible. If you’re used to getting preferential treatment according to your loyalty/status at Marriott properties, you can kiss that goodbye here. I have titanium elite status and a lifetime status, however, I have struggled to get even the basic recognition from the staff here. It’s been a pain to even get my bonus points and night credit for the room that I booked using my certificate. Just look for a different Marriott property in the city."
6299,"Hilton was the only global brand available for this New Year’s Eve. Sofitel in Copacabana was closed for refurbishment. Rooms at Hilton are poorly decorated and maintained, service is absolutely poor, cleaniness of the pool a disaster and breakfast memorable, from a negative standpoint. The only good hint is the view: it is really fantastic. If you don’t care about hotel services and quality and want to get a view, this is your choice."
6300,"All the staff in this hotel are so good, nothing is too much trouble. Bed was comfortable, kettle provided, very quiet, delicious breakfast. Short walk from the metro and cafes/bars. We walked ( long) along the river to the Louvre and Musee D’Orsay. Would recommend "
6301,"Location was great to get around to different parts of the city and see art. We got the twin room and both slept the best sleep we have had in years!  The beds are so comfy, bathrooms are a dream and the lobby is very comfy to hang out in. I love that you can help yourself to tea and coffee throughout the day and do a little work there.   The staff are also so friendly and accomodating - all greay!"
6302,Nice modern hotel in Berlin with interesting historical links to the old diary market. Recommend to have breakfast in the hotel breakfast room which was part of the old diary. Nice location by river. Recommend to have a nice German beer in the garden and enjoy the boats and views
6303,"Seriously, I had to endure 5 days there, and my god was it hell. The pillows sucked, and the bed was as hard as you can get. Worst bed ever. You realize, the bed is the most imoortant thing in most peoples stay right? Yes you are in a good location, but I stayed in the doubletree Central and it was much more enjoyable. Get better beds!"
6304,"group of 7 friends visiting Amsterdam specifically for the coffeeshops transferred here after being double booked. Nothing wrong with the apartments themselves, but had originally booked one that allows smoking. the Samsung smart tv with Netflix installed was great. clean comfy beds, however we found a 'hen night' sash folded up inside one of the sofa beds. Stoners should avoid, this place does not tolerate cannabis being smoked on the property at all. was easy to find and we had no problems checking in or out. I received a phone call the day after we checked out saying there was still someone asleep in one of our rooms, but we had all left the country by then which makes me question their security. Overall good stay but was really let down when we were told we couldn't smoke…"
6305,"First off, I have never left a trip advisor review. This hotel makes me break that.   I really wanted to like this hotel. It is cute, and relatively well priced given the city it is in. The hotel has a cool funky vibe, decent lighting and friendly staff. Our room was on the 6th floor and pretty spacious I have to say. The bathroom was small (sink outside the bathroom, but no big deal) - the showerhead was awesome. Bed was OK. Cool brick wall. We didn't hear any of the neighboring rooms at all. Sounds great huh?  Well, the problem is the street noise. We had the windows shut (I doubt they open). When we got to the room we thought ""hey, cool! you can hear the trolly cars go past"". Course, that was 3 in the afternoon. This sounds 10000x louder at 1am when you just want to go to…"
6306,"Stayed here for a weekend with friends. Really enjoyed the stay and will probably return at some point. The hotel is beautiful, we had a Junior Suite which was spacious with fabulous decor and great views. The food in the hotel was fabulous, and many delicious healthy choices available so we didn't come home feeling that we had overdone it. It's pricey but we knew that when we booked. Good location In the city centre."
6307,Stayed here fo two nights a few things to start wifi wouldnt connect with instructions from hotel eventually sorted couldnt get tv to get english language again sorted but should have ok in a 5× hotel. Food at breakfast not hot - not difficult!! Rooms very good but its the little things which make for a good stay. Staff very friendly
6308,We throughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel was a refuge from the bustle of the city outside. Our room was large and with arm chairs to relax and the most comfortable mattress I’ve slept on in a hotel. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We have shared our recommendations with friends and family and hope that a room will still available for us when we want to return.
6309,"the hotel is beautiful, an ancient art deco building, and the room is as big a it could be. but, and there is a lot of `buts`, the staff is cold and distant, the breakfast of a 3 stars hotel and the overall impression is that they aren`t worried wether you are happy or not."
6311,My wife and I stayed at the Peninsula Paris for our anniversary.  The hotel is as beautiful as it gets and our room was stunning. The staff were very friendly and the service exceptional. They prepared for us a really spacious room and as it wasn't ready on time they offered us drinks at the very elegant Kleber Bar. They also offered us macaroons in our room. The room was great with a dressing room and a very elegant bathroom. High end amenities and very personalised service. Justifies its reputation and price.
6312,"The location is perfect, middle of the city, the quality of bed and amenities are ok, nothing special Housekeeping should get training how to clean rooms and how often amenities should be refilled and linen should be changed most negative - Front office - the staff working there are not qualified, not costumer oriented, busy with their private thinks, never a good morning, never a word how are you, NO thank you during check out, no question how did you liked the stay , it very clear the staff need professional training"
6313,"Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights with my family. The location is quite good. The hotel is just next to the railway station also few good bars and restaurants around the place. The hotel has free wi-fi. Nice breakfast . A bit far from the city center . The only drawbacks were the front desk service, that  depends on who happens to be at the desk at the time. The ladies at the front desk are really rude and unable to be friendly  at anytime, can’t  help with a simple  tourist information or any other information .Overall a good place to stay for value. Only thing to improve is to have more pleasant staff."
6315,"I promise to keep this as short as possible though the innumerable instances over my two day stay at the Novotel will need some narration. Begins at check in where I was told there were no king beds leaving me with no choice but forced to settle for a smoking room to avoid staying in a twin room. 30 mins into check in I was amazed to find an extremely unhygienic and way below standard room given to me, the room was dusty with stub marks on the headrest of the bed, crinkled pillow cases, a piece of steel wire lying unnoticed on the  carpet and dusty remote and phone which  unfortunately I had to use to call them to raise an alarm about the state of the room. Well this is not all, it only gets better with more findings like a strand of hair on the towel, dal stains on the curtain,…"
6316,"overall it was Okay. It was 'Nice'  it wasn't  Fabulous. it was €500 per night for an average size room. (€250per per) the view was nice.Everything else was okay..  The  pillows were FABULOUS.   We slept very well. On the 3rd day house keeping wanted us out of the room at 9am... bang bang bang.. she would not give up. she wanted to do the room early. i thought that was ridculous. we sent her packing, with difficulty, and put a do not disturb sign up for the remainder of the next 2days. overall it really wasnt worth the money.  The staff are nice, and very polite, but dont seem to care, at all, you try to order or get there attendion they  look in the other direction when you want them, no attenion to detail. very very slow service.  All of this is quirky, and funny to a degree,…"
6317,"I was there many times. but for this price (+/- 120€ per night) you can find better place. anyhow if there is no better choice, you take what is only possible. main problem is the smell in rooms which can be comparable with moulded carpet or something like that. windows are small, cannot be open  whole range, so that`s why as I guess. but for me the biggest problem is breakfast. because they prepare also scrambled eggs as fresh keeping the windows closed - you smell during the whole day as mix of breakfast. that`s really announced for the reception desk, but until now no result. I always keep my old shirt for the breakfast and then have the shower and as the fastest runner go out form the hotel to avoid keeping this smell shirt or suit while whole day..but anyhow.....nice ladies…"
6318,"If they create a 6 stars hotel certification, then this hotel would be the first one in line. The reception team was extremely kind and helpful. The room is extremely spacious, and clean. The bathroom is very well equipped. The bed is super comfortable, along with the pillows (I wish I knew from where did they get these)... The service throughout my stay was amazing, the breakfast was great. Overall, this hotel deserves to be really recognized. Highly recommend it :)  "
6319,"Don't choose Clift Hotel for your stay in SF unless you want a very useless and expensive experience. Wifi is not include in the room price (yes we are in 2018) : extra 18$/day for wifi. and they charge a 10$ each day for food and beverage even if you don't consum anything. so nearly 30$/day to add to an already expensive price room. Rooms are just normal, nothing exceptional and if you have the chance to be in front of the fitness room (we were lucky!) you'll be able to sleep around 5h per night because sports man make lots of noise from 6am to midnight. And dont try to request anything, we asked for high floor and they gave us 2nd floor... Furnitures are old and carpets durty... Except the lobby and bar, nothing looks like a high quality hotel. Fortunately employees are nice,…"
6320,"It is uneasy to find Hotels in Paris at 3 stars rating, which are as clean, modern and with a cool interior design - The ""La Parisienne"" has it all and also the staff is very friendly and speaks good english  !"
6322,Visited a bit before march 16 but this won't let me input dates. This place was great. Central and full of young people travelling. We met people from everywhere who all wanted to go out and enjoy the city. Would recommend this for a group of friends. Noisy but clean
6323,"This is a very simple but clean, modern and very comfortable hotel. He room is compact but doesn't feel too small because of the design, the lobby is nice, breakfast was very good. Very good value for money and great location, walking distance from checkpoint Charlie and the Jewish museum."
6324,"Weakness 1) the smell of dirt of the carpet that pervades the whole structure and in particular the chamber. 2) Late check-in not available before 3 p.m. Strenght 1) The structure has a strategic position because it is attached to the subway, to the stop of the tram n°13 that is very comfortable to reach the historical center, through the subway it is very comfortable for the airport and the last day I was able to go to the center with the tram13, to return to take the suitcase and in a moment with subway and train to arrive to the airport. "
6325,"It is a clean and nice property. Very close to our event and not too far from the airport. OK for business stop overs. Also close to UBahn and other central amenities. There is a new hotel being constructed next door, so make sure you stay in the right room. "
6326,"I am writing this review at 01:50 in the morning because housekeeping are cleaning the rooms around me and I am now wide awake. To put my review into context - in the last 2 months I have stayed at a number of leading 5* brand hotel.  When requested I will complete a hotel survey and thank staff when I have had a quality stay.  I have not written a review on Trip Advisor for a number of months as any hotel issues I have faced have generally been resolved with minimum fuss. In the case of the Sheraton Rio de Janeiro - I make an exception.  This hotel positions itself as luxury, 5*, leading resort.  It is not.  My room was dirty on arrival - old plastic bag on the floor and somebody else's sandy feet in my bed.  The in-room coffee facilities are budget hotel at best.  The pool…"
6328,"This hotel is very basic and no frills, but it is modern and clean, and the service is friendly and prompt. It is near several restaurants and a huge shopping mall. My daughter and I stayed there for one night. The power and wi-fi went out several times when we were there (they had warned us that it would due to some ongoing work), but other than that, the facilities were fine. They do not offer room service, so we went to the 24/7 restaurant downstairs one night about about 7 or 8, but we could not order anything from the menu that required cooking or mixing a drink, which was disappointing. The breakfast, which you can pay for as an extra, offers a wide variety of basic breakfast food. The custard tarts were particularly good. Checkout was easy, and the front desk staff called…"
6329,"I fly to san francisco every week for business. i try to avoid this hotel like a plague because the rooms are awful, dirty and flat out not worth $400/night. Further, and despite being a loyal SPG member, and having stayed many times, I always get the worst rooms (maybe all of them are like that).  No surprise, I got an awful room yet again this trip. I asked to change and they agreed. the other room was no better but what made this unique was the awful smell in the room and the bed. Needless to say I didn't sleep all night and I didnt want to call front desk since they would be useless. The smell was so bad in the carpet and in the bed..pretty disturbing!"
6330,"This was my first family trip to Paris and we had a very pleasant at this nice hotel. It is small but very newly renovated, clean and compact. Rooms are really nice, even if they are compact they all the necessary amenities including an electronic safe, automated toilets, tea coffee makers, nice soft beds and extremely modern and well maintained. We were 2 adults & 1 kid but always comfortable in the room along with a child bed. The main advantage point is it is 5 mins walk from Eiffel tower, connects to 3 metro lines at the La-motte Picquet station. So you can go to Arc de triumph or Notre Dame or Louvre museum from this place. Very conveniently located. We traveled in Paris using the Metro always, so convenient, free of traffic jams and quite cheap. We even went to Disney land…"
6332,"Fabulous location to your Paris--walking distance to most tourist spots.  Easy access to metro.  Rooms clean, comfortable with lovely large windows.  Facilities are modern.  Staff helpful and courteous.Breakfast was convenient and great start to the day.  Would stay again and recommend to friends."
6333,"The only good thing about the hotel is the view and maybe the pool. The rooms are dirty and old, the beds are not good, television is a joke (only open channels with the bad transmission). When I removed my bag off the closet I noticed a layer of dust stuck in the trunk, which certainly had not formed soon. The only thing the maids seemed to do was make the bed, I was fifteen days in this hotel and I have my doubts if the bathroom was clean."
6334,"This hotel is brutal. Probably one of my least favorite hotel experiences in recent memory. Room has windows that are opaque because it looks onto a shady alley (even with an “UPGRADED ROOM” so there is no natural light. The record player did not work. The water pressure is terrible. Nobody outside to help you with your bags. Valet says it will be 15-20 minutes to get your car, closer to 45-60 mins. The room smells like mildew. Place is totally brutal."
6335,Very small room for a single bed. Great location seconds walk from the tram stop. Nice and clean.  Very noisy in the morning Staff dont smile at all keep on saying okkay to end the conversation. Very tiny and high stairs difficult to get down.. nearly tripped twice coming down. I stayed there for three nights.  I probably would not stay there again.
6336,Room was dirty and the hotel staff was completely rude and unhelpful. We were approved for an early check in but the front desk woman wouldn’t even look up our reservation. She simply screamed “NOT UNTIL 3PM”. She was a complete shrew. 
6337,"We stay at this Ibis hotel for five days and enjoyed it. It is located 5 mins from a metro station so very convenient. The room was a nice size with a large shower room, it was cleaned everyday and all the staff were friendly and helpful."
6338,"Our daughter and son in law  had already stayed at the hotel last year and loved it. They booked for us and themselves. Hotel was lovely, the management up graded both our rooms for the 4 night stay. These rooms very luxurious, staff all very helpful. Cigar room with bar , which had lovely atmosphere, and was always full, sometimes difficult to get a table and chairs. would recommend to anyone. Near to station and underground."
6339,"I spent 7 nights in the Hotel du Lion on my first solo trip to Europe. The trip from the airport to the hotel was very easy. My room was ready when I got there. The room was very clean and was cleaned in a timely manner every day.The location is great, the metro is right outside the front door, and the staff was extremely helpful. The shower was really small, but everything else exceeded my expectations."
6340,"This hotel is located in the quieter Museum Island area but situated nicely to roam the city. The Spittelmarkt U-Bahn station is just few minutes walk and from there you can get the U2 line to Alexanderplatz, the German Market, Potsdamer Platz, the Zoo or out towards Charlottenburg. If you fancy walking everywhere you can easily walk to many sites in under 15 minutes.  The rooms themselves are spacious and comfortable. The mini kitchenette is great if you want to use it. We just used the glasses for a late night glass of wine. Check-in was smooth and we arrived at midday to told our room was already ready which was a bonus. The bathrooms were great with a normal shower or a rainfall shower. More importantly, the staff were friendly and helpful (something that can’t be said of…"
6341,"I and my family had a table booked for the celebration of 100 Years of Latvia as well as birthday of my Dad on 18th November. We arrived promptly at 7pm just to be told that hotels parking was full. We went to speak to the reception staff and were advised that although ‘parking space was complimentary it was not guaranteed’. Our party of 11 people including two very young children had to split. We went inside while 3 others went looking for nearby parking places. They returned around 40 minutes later having had parked nearly 2 miles away in Agenskalns! They returned on a tram as taxi service was equally unavailable during this busy time, therefore it was already 8 pm when we finally all had a chance to sit down by the table. Although our waiter Daniels(unsure about spelling) was…"
6342,"If Amsterdam is your destination then you should consider this hotel. It is wonderful in every way, starting with the warm welcome at  check-in and right up until your bags are packed and ready, waiting to leave. The lady at the reception was nice. Everything seemed to by very modern and elegant. It definitily is one way, but also with little rooms, dameged carpet in the first floor, no fresh beds by the house keeping etc. It is great anyway, but for 200Euro p.N. I expact a little bit more."
6343,"Very nice budget accommodation ranging from dormitory bed to private room. We, me and my friend stayed there for two night in private room. we were surprised to see the comfort level.  Staffs were very courteous, process of booking awesome and cleanliness was as good as any hotel... centrally located near BERLIN central (Hauptbahnhof) station. 5 minutes walk, most of Berlin attractions are very close by......"
6344,"Stayed here for three nights early September, 2015.  Staff impressive and so were grounds .  But disappointed because of no air conditioning (it was hot) and no restaurant or room service in hotel. Furthermore they charge a significant daily fee for fast wifi. Finally walls are thin so heard upstairs guest in morning (at 6:30) showering and packing."
6345,"Hotel is conveniently located close to Museum Island, so you can walk to all the main attraction on East Side of Berlin, subway is also very close.  Room was rather spacious, but walls are a bit thin, so you can hear it when people in next room move something or making some noise, so bring some earplugs if you plan to stay here.  Breakfast was a standard hotel variety, yet it is a bit too expensive - 21 Euro.  Not sure if I will stay here again, as I prefer quiet rooms, but would have if it was not an issue."
6346,"Stayed here for 10 nights, 5 nights during the carnival and 5 nights after. My intial assessment was that the staff are so horrible probably because of the carnival but they didnt even get better afterwards. The rooms are ok, bathroom looked a bit dated and they will sell you room on the side of the hotel as a beach view room which might show you a glimpse of the beach if you stretch out on the balcony. It is an expensive hotel compared to other hotels on copacabana beach and it is definitely not worth the price."
6347,"This hotel is really awful - rates 2, maybe 3, stars The positives are that (whilst it is away from the action) it is literally above the subway station, making it easy to get around, and it has the best Concierge desk we came across in China. However, despite advertising to the contrary, there is no general lounge area, and no bar (and no ""live music"" as promoted). We could not recognise ANY of the photographs on their website, which was really disappointing. The main entrance is in a dirty back alley. We booked and Executive room, and were amazed that it was so small. The switches for the lights were impossible to get to work, and the curtains could not be drawn without stretching over the ""furniture"". The Executive room gave us access to the Executive Lounge, which we hardly…"
6348,Fantastic place. Great service. Will recommend to all. Check it out.  Close to center. Quiet and secure. Love the place.  Personal service from great owners with great care for hospitality peaople that care about their guests. 
6349,"Worst Hilton I’ve ever stayed at. Room service failed to clean my room during my stay. Shower floor was filthy.    Conferences rooms way over priced. No window, poor amenities and the probably the most expensive lunch sandwich I’ve ever come across.  Recommend you look elsewhere."
6350,"I was in Barcelona for a conference and as the conference venue was in the hotel itself, i preferred to book the room in the same hotel.  Checkin process was easy and i was given the city view room as per my choice. Rooms were spacious and clean.  Hotel is close to the FCB stadium and some other amenities. Breakfast buffet was good and the spread was really excellent. choose this hotel if you really want to have a luxurious stay. it was close to metro, and tram stations."
6352,"I booked this hotel for a guest of mine from China and this hotel continuously gave me issues from the time of check in. I booked it as club carlson member where it is clearly mentioned all payment will be done at checkout. However this is the series of incidents happend despite of me being totally coordinating with them.  1) On check-in of guest, I got the call from Front desk (Ms. Komal) and asked for booking confirmation and I confirmed that I have already given the card as gurantee in booking and as per booking payments will be done on checkout. She very abruptly said, we cannot allow the guest to check in without full payment being done. After discussion it was concluded that I can send the CC form for authorization however I will be charged at checkout. I agreed and sent…"
6354,"Fantastic stay, location is excellent, in walking distance of everything. The morning breakfast sets you up for the day. The staff were very friendly, Mud (that is her name) at the front desk was most helpful and very good at her job"
6356,"The resort was ok, but mainly because of the views. The condo was clean but had lots of bugs and no good fan.  We had to ask for extra fans. The staff was not as friendly as vietnamese are mostly. We wonder why.... The food was not that good. And way to much. That is a pitty to have to throw it all away. The view is perfect, the sea nice to swim in. Don't forget shoes because of stings of the sea urchin. The snorkling trip was not what we expected eather. We had a boottrip for one hour but not that nice koral and only a few fisch."
6357,"Location ok, price ok , But ""bed bugs"" forget it!!!! Stayed there for 3 nights.when i was getting up on my last day ,i saw i big bug on my shoulder (ewww) hurriedly get a tower and killed it. blood stains on the towel. when i checked-out, brought the evidence to the front desk . The reaction that i got shocked me.It seems like it happens alot wth other costumers and theyre not doin something about it, we showed it to the manager, and he just shrugged his shoulder, didnt even say a`word!!!!!! AVOID THIS HOTEL!!!!!!!!!"
6358,"We thoroughly enjoyed our five night stay at the Hotel Lumen.  From the friendly staff to the comfortable room to the fabulaous location, we could not ask for more.  When we return to Paris, we'll be sure to stay here again."
6359,"Very good hotel in excellent location. Near the Potsdamer Platz, but very quiet surrounding. Family friendly. Very quiet and good climate control. Excellent breakfast choice. Separate buffet table for children."
6361,"I think staying on the beach at Ipanema is great, and this hotel is very well located. But it's quite expensive and the service leaves much to be desired. The front desk had especially poor service, i.e. they were very unhelpful and even slightly rude. The quality of the room was okay, nothing very nice about it, but it wasn't terrible.   Highlight : very from the rooftop pool/bar. Lowlight: front-desk service was terrible."
6362,"I visited this hotel with my girlfriend for a 6-day tourism trip in Berlin. It is situated quite close to the U-Bahn stop U-Bismarckstraße which provides easy access to the city's public transport grid. Our room looked like the one in the photos in the hotel's website and we asked for one with a separate bathroom. It overlooked the back side of the hotel. The bedsheets and towels were clean, as was the floor's carpet. In the bathroom soap, body wash, plastic bags and paper tissues was conveniently offered in dispensers. Tea and coffee bags were also offered although not free of charge. The bed's mattress was soft providing comfort during sleep. Air conditioning was operating normally at any temperature set. Only one hint: since the breakfast in hotel is quite expensive…"
6363,"We booked 2 nights but our plane was delayed and we arrived the next morning. The hotel staff didn't let us in our room although they charged us.They asked $20 to go in early as they gave the room to someone else! We were upset so they gave us 2 small bottles of water to compensate! It was the most expensive water I've drank ($96)! Finally, we got in our room and boy it was bad. The hallway was dark like you're going to hell: the walls were covered with brown wallpaper as well as the carpet which,by the way,was sticky and looked really dirty. Then, the room was small and dark.We paid for a king bed and we got 2 double beds.The sheets were smelly and the room was humid.The shower had no curtain, only a half glass wall so the water got all out and immersed the washroom.When we…"
6364,"Excellent for vacation, close to the harbor and major sites. Little bit difficult to enter the parking but it shouldn't be a problem for a average driver ;) Seaside is just 8-10 minutes waking distance"
6365,"I would never recommend staying here. My first room had bed bugs, and when I flagged this with the concierge I was told that it was probably an allergic reaction. I wasn't able to speak to anyone in person, the concierge, manager and claims department choosing to interact with me over the phone. I have since had a doctor look over my symptoms and confirm these were in fact bed bugs. I've re-submitted my claim and called, and no response. Terrible customer service, terrible hygiene."
6366,"The hotel decor is timeless and elegant.  That is the best part of the hotel.  We were looking for a few relaxing days by the beach/ pool.  We expected, wrongly, that by paying $2000/ 3 nights we would be staying at an upscale hotel and expected the service and facilities to be comparable.  Sadly, there was little relaxing about it.  If you weren't pool-side/ beach side bright and early, it wasn't possible to get a seat and you couldn't take one on your own, you needed to hunt down an attendant to try to find one for you or you were tossed out.    Beds/ cabanas were running $450 - $1000/ day.  At the beach, the front row was taken by beds with covers, so no one else could see the water, unless you were in it.  Forget about watching your kids from a chair!   Want an umbrella,…"
6367,"The receptionist told us to park outside the hotel while we took our bags upstairs and then move the car to the garage behind for $18 per 24hr reduced rate. We got a $95 fine as parking outside the hotel is apparently not allowed (for even the 5 minutes we were upstairs). It was also $40 per night parking as the reduced rate deal finished the month before (we found this out when we picked the car up after 2 days).  At 1am on the 2nd night we awoke to water dripping through the ceiling. The night man (great help, although apparently not a full time employee) let us stay in a different room, but told us it was a known heating problem (from the water sprinkler? Really?). On check-out, the receptionist refused to let us speak with the manager and instead spoke to her on the phone in…"
6368,"We booked the Hotel de Hallen for our mini-moon after getting married, we contacted the hotel prior to our arrival to let them know it was a special occasion for us, and they told us that this had been marked in their diary. When we arrived to check in, no mention of this was made, which is fair enough, we were happy enough to be away together celebrating getting married. However the least I expected was to be shown to the right room, we were originally assigned to a twin room despite having booked a deluxe double room, I sincerely hope that this was an oversight and not because we were two women checking in together. We went back to reception and got a new room with a king bed.  We could not work our what the difference is between a deluxe double and a regular double other than…"
6369,"Me and my friend we stay here for 2 night. Overall here if I can give scroll from 1-10 point I will give only 3 in 10 point. Well the only thing we like here is Staff especially James in the dinner time and Sam in the breakfast times both of them are so friendly, nice and keep high standards of the Intercontinental hotel. The less I don't like it and will not come back here again."
6371,"I've planned an event at this hotel before. I fell in love with the garden and lobby area, and the overall feel of the hotel was really interesting. As a gift, I decided to stay here with my husband and we were shocked after our experience.  First, the hotel room was massive, yet felt empty. There were staples/nails sticking out on the edge of the carpets which ripped my socks. No other room issues otherwise, but nothing looked as advertised on their site. It felt like a small empty studio with cheap carpet, and decor.  The hotel staff was scattered and it felt like no one was communicating to each other. At one point, all I wanted to do was go to the lobby bar, which I've been to before. Normally it opens around 4. Upon check-in, I was told the bar opened during this time.…"
6372,"The hostel was fine. Little overpriced. Good location (near Vondelpark, Liedsplein, museums and nightlife) good breakfast for extra €5. Clean enough. Pillows and mattress were really good. They have a lift! Not many hostels in Amsterdam do, so that's a plus. The only bad thing were 2 cats living in the building and I'm allergic. "
6374,"Just spent three very pleasant nights at this lovely hotel.  Set back on a quiet-ish street it's a haven from the hustle and bustle, while being an ideal base for exploring historic Montmartre.  The welcome was warm and the check-in quick and easy. The room was very clean and quite spacious by Paris standards.  The room could have done with a little more soundproofing.  However this appears to be a common issue with Paris hotels.  A minor grumble and it certainly didn't spoil our stay.  We were visiting Paris to attend a concert at the opposite end of the city and we had been looking for somewhere with good transport links. The hotel is well served by two metro stations on different lines - making the whole city easily accessible.  "
6375,"I stayed at Casa Aurea during the month of July for 10 days. The accommodation I stayed at was very modest and basic, although because it was located in a basement under the kitchen it was quite dark, with views of a construction zone, and no window in the bathroom (thus chilly in the evenings and morning). There was a lot of noise on the ceiling of my room, from foot traffic in the main house's kitchen very early in the morning, and the wifi signal was very weak in the basement bedroom. Even though this rusticity is part of the ""charm"" that Casa Aurea advertises, I feel that for the price that one pays, one does not really get very good value or much comfort. While Casa Aurea costs less money than other hotels in Rio, it is not inexpensive either. The pousada's decoration is…"
6376,"Stayed here with two friends for 2 nights. The staff couldn't do enough, including allowing us to chill out for a couple of hours in the afternoon, before we caught out flight even though we had checked out in the morning. Location is perfect for anyone wanting to tour Paris, Metro and buses on your doorstep. We had a great stay, thank you."
6377,I will start with a positive - the hotels location. We had a great view of the apple shop on stockton street and the hotel is right next to Powell street station. The advantage of its location is the hotel is so bad that every time you leave it at least you are somewhere good.   Now i live in the heart of the east end of london and live in a listed building with no double glazing. I am used to noise but oh my god this was crazy at the zelos!! It was so busy so we were on the same floor as the bar which was an incredibly noisy place to be. On top of that there was the drummer that played every evening relentlessly. The walls and ceilings were also like paper so you can hear other people in adjacent rooms and in the corridors.   Our shower was broken and emitted a high pitched…
6378,"Good Hotel. Very good situated. On one Hand next to a U-Station and on the other Hand next to the Potzdamerplatz. It has many lifts, so that you never wait long. Also at the reception is allways somebody, and you don't wait long to get the service."
6379,"We booked an apartment for six days. The room decor was a bit tired and needs an update, but was of a good size and very bright and airy. The only thing missing was a table and chairs for eating. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The location is conveniently located to all of Berlins main attractions, plus there are are plenty of cafes and supermarkets nearby. The Bacco bakery cafe is just a few doors away, serving a fantastic breakfast."
6380,"We were here for an event at the bar. We came to get our car at the valet and it took 45 minutes to get the car when we were leaving, as they couldn’t find the keys (which were in their drawer) despite checking five times with no update from the valet. This wouldn’t have been so bad if their lobby was not freezing cold with no heat on the coldest day of the year. Honestly a bad enough experience that I would never come back here. In addition, they argued with our friend that he had been there for 90 minutes more than he was to attempt to charge him for the valet, and they would not check our bags during the event though we had come straight from the airport and had nowhere to put them. Pretty unacceptable all around, would highly recommend against visiting this place"
6382,"Decent hotel but nearby night clubs and bars blast music till at least midnight.  Ridiculously noisy, like a Beats Pill blasting in your room. Not acceptable for business travelers or anyone expecting to go to sleep before 2am."
6383,"I'm a platinum member with SPG.  This hotel has the worst customer service ever!  I left my silver sweater and scarf there and literally I got the run around.   First I was told that ok, we will mail it to you.  3 weeks went by, I haven't receive them.  Then I got some lady name Brianna calling me and told me that I still have my sweater and scarf there.  Well then she told me that I have to pay shipping for them which came out to exhorbitant amount.  I called back and told them I will be picking them up.  They asked me for my room number, into,d them I don't remember but I've described the items to them.  Then operator transfer me to accounting, accounting transferred me to house keeping. Housekeeping transferred me back to front desk, front desk,told me he has a customer and…"
6384,"Got a single room with private bathroom for under £40 which feels like a good deal in Amsterdam.  The room was very small, not really an issue as I was only there to sleep, but seems to have been recently redone so that was nice and was clean.  However the bed was very very soft so wasn't the most comfortable which made sleep take a while to come along with the fact my room was at the top of teh first flight of stairs which was quite noisy.  Those stairs are also very thin and steep so be warned if you have an issue with climbing stairs, also bed was rather short so anyone over 5'10 may struggle to get comfortable.  I didn't have breakfast in the morning so unable to comment on that.  The staff were very polite and welcoming though and if you are looking for a hotel in a decent…"
6385,Good location but an awful hotel.  Friendly welcome turned into a hard sell on upgrading room.  Initially the guy suggested a great deal for an extra $100 per night.  I declined and then he told me he had to help us since we were staying for 5 nights.  Eventually I relented and agreed to pay 30 extra for a recently renovated room with a bridge view.  Room was poor and old and brown!  We had to chase housekeeping for essential items and cleaning was sloppy.  Deli was convenient but more than $6 for a small latte with an extra shot is crazy.  Valet parking closes from front of hotel at 8pm and costs $67 per day and u have to walk to back of hotel to collect ur car so it is same as self parking.  No breakfast included in expensive rate and the welcome for Honors guests was a bottle…
6386,"I was staying there from 1.10.17 untill 5.10.17 and enjoyed every moment. The service was very good, the workers are very kind, the room is big and clean. The location is perfect. And the breakfast was delicious! Highly recommend"
6387,"First visit to the ""AMAZING CITY OF BARCELONA"" So picked a hotel away from the busy city, but needed a location with great transport links !! this is perfect. HOP ON /OFF BUSS outside,hotel, METRO two minutes away.   HUGE shopping mall next door !! great for shopping & dining. The hotel is very clean, yes it needs some touch up cosmetically in some areas, but I cant see this hotel ever being empty enough for it to happen quickly. HERE IS THE REASON I have written this review is i am a people watcher & sat in the lobby lounge guests who needed help with luggage /help/taxis were met by a member of door staff who was smartly turned out huge smile & gladly helped everyone, his name is   PAULO     Nothing was to much trouble for him.   I have complained about service or bad hotels in…"
6389,"Unprofessional staff. So many things to name that went wrong & that were handled incorrectly. They charged the wrong credit card. The dresser in our room was missing drawers, we did not have a remote to the tv, only one elevator working in the hotel, people were picketing outside of the hotel the entire weekend, they charged me $62 a day for parking when I was supposed to have the $25 per day parking package, I called the hotel on 4 different occasions before the arrival and not one note was put on my reservation!!! That is what Hector said anyway!! I have names and dates of every time I called & person I spoke to. NOT ONE NOTE ADDED!! Was charged $9.95 a day for a service fee. WHAT SERVICE FEE??? This hotel did nothing to service my family. It was a mess from the start. I even received an email from Elizabeth apologizing on behalf Cambria and for everything that went wrong. The only thing good about this property was the location & the housekeeping staff.…"
6390,"Loved the hotel, but hated the roaches. My friend saw a review which spoke of the roaches, but the place was just so lovely, I believed it was probably a past problem.We did not see any until the day of checkout, which was also a little wierd. The disappointing part was that the front desk just apologized and that was it. Not one accommodation!"
6391,"Generally this hotel was quite good.  The location was decent, though not quite as good as some of the other reviews implied - however, by no means a bad location.  Just a bit farther than expected.  The hallways leading to the rooms are VERY dark, which was a bit strange.  The room was basically fine, though the TV was a bit comical (13"").  The shower really needs a curtain or sliding door, as it makes a mess of the floor.  The pillows were also quite small and only two for the whole double bed - easily fixed by asking the front desk for more, but it would have been better if they were already there.  Finally, we had a power outage on our last morning, though I suspect that was the town and not the hotel's fault.  The staff was quite good throughout our visit."
6392,Great Hotel! Nice and helpfull staff. Rooms are a little small but beautifull and very clean. Can't beat the value for many and it's just a 10 minute walk from the Palais. We book this hotel year after year due to the conference we attend.  I would recommend this Hotel any day!
6394,"We arrived at 2:00 pm and totally understand that the room won’t be ready until 3:00. We went to the restaurant, flies were everywhere, food came out cold. Only set menu options. We voiced that our food were cold and the server said he will check for us but never came back. Food portion is very small for the price we paid. Bowls and plates were all wet, we had to ask for tissue paper to clean the plates and bowls. Staff are very friendly and trying their best to accommodate. We finally got to our room, the floors are dusty and the extra bed is not done. They entered the suite without knowing we were already there. On the bright side, the pool and the beach is beautiful. We might sound a little hard on the review, but it’s a five stars resort."
6395,"For the past three hours (it's now 3:30 am) a series of garbage trucks have been LOUDLY unloading just a few floors below my hotel room. If you like to hear loud, abrupt bangs throughout the night-- this place is for you! Otherwise, I would advise the hotel to figure out what the hell is going  on-- and fix it-- so people can sleep."
6397,"We stayed 3 nights which was more than enough. The hotel is close to the Back beach popular with the locals, nice clean sand and sea.Nobody speaks English, certainly not at the hotel so can only assume a change of ownership given the previous reviews. The family were friendly so lots of mime.Laundry was excellent and cheap, 1kg = 20,000vnd. Most bars (although looked a bit seedy) and restaurants were a bit too far at Front Beach but some nearby places to eat local fish and com dishes OK (if you don't mind watching the rats running around!) Disappointing was the cleanliness of the accommodation, dead mosquitoes on bedroom floor, dusty windows, dirty mirror in bathroom, marked walls and housekeeping not done every day.We had to change room after the first night from the front as…"
6398,"What a disappointment with customer service, I purchased a weekend getaway through SF Travel which offered a gift certificate of two $100.00 gift certificates for the sky view lounge at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis. The gift certificate is very specific to email chelsea.ricketts@marriot… why you list a person who does not respond to emails or phone calls? The disappointment is not that the gift certificates are expired it's the lack of customer service and response time provided. It's really simple to respond to an email or a telephone call.  John  "
6399,"Our stay at the turtle bay resort from November 5th to November 12th fell well below expectations. It totally bummed out our trip to Hawaii. I can say that I’d never stay there again, even though the pools and the beach area are fantastic!!  We were in Hawaii for a wedding. I thought why not splurge on a nice hotel. The Turtle Bay came highly recommended by our travel agent. The issue we ran into is that my daughter and I had got bug bites all over. We stayed in room # XXXX. I had more in the way of number of bites, but my poor daughter’s bites were worse as they were super itchy and inflamed for days.  I was REALLY disappointed by the hotel’s response (which was not much of anything, except initially to put new sheets on the bed).  They said all they found in the room was…"
6401,We stayed at the Hotel SERHA Rivoli Rambla on a recent trip to see our son in Barcelona. I must say that the location could not have been better with the La Rambla right oustside your door step. The hotel was keeped to a very high standard and hotel staff were extremely friendly. The buffet breakfast was very good with plenty of variety. Overall my wife and myself enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again.
6403,"Hotel is huge with many pools and a tower block some 11 floors above ground level and similar down the cliff to sea level. Our room was a sea view on the 15th floor. My wife, who suffers from vertigo, walked on to the glass-fronted balcony and went dizzy. We asked to be moved, which was not a problem, and finished up on floor 2 overlooking the infinity pool. This was supposed to be an upgrade but was actually nothing special as hotel rooms go, and we were now overlooked by pool users. The buffet dining room was like a huge barn with about as much ambience and the food choice, especially at dinner, limited. Breakfasts were good with plenty to choose from. I was not impressed with having to pay 4 euros per day to have the courtesy tray topped up - not 5 star behaviour!. We have…"
6404,"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights recently.   Firstly I'll start with the positives of the hotel. It is well located in the city centre with lots of amenities around it. The staff are welcoming, friendly and extremely helpful in general. Nothing is a problem for them. The view from the Rossio restaurant is breathtaking and breakfast is such a treat at that vantage point. The nespresso in the room is a nice addition as well as welcome fruit and water. We were also given late checkout on our final day which was extremely kind of the hotel.  However unfortunately for us the negatives far outweigh the positives. This hotel is advertised as a five star property and we felt it was a long way from that. We were so disappointed with our room- it was extremely small and the windows…"
6405,"Been coming here for more than a decade several times a year.  Overall very good hotel, BUT what's the deal with the cookies?  They tell you that the warm cookies will be out at 7.  By 7:30 they were all gone!  Sign says one per person!  When I asked when the next batch would be available I was told that one batch of two dinner plate sized portions was all for the night.  So sorry.  You either have cookies or you don't."
6406,"Went on a long weekend Christmas market shopping. The hotel was near some markets and therefore no transport was needed. We had a family room size which was good, but quite basic. Some of the interior could do with a face lift, but for the purpose of our stay, it was comfortable and good. It would have been nice to have a bar to have some drinks in the evening. The wifi in the room wasn't very stable."
6407,"There are many H10 hotels in Barcelona, but this H10 has a great location. It is rated 4 1/2 stars. It is in walking distance to the marina and the gothic quarters. The rooms are small but clean. It has great free WiFi. It also has a small roof top swimming pool with a bar and lounge. There is no onsite gym, but they will provide a voucher for a gym close by. There is no room service. Also housekeeping does not get to your room until 5 or 6 pm. They usually do not clean the room, the only make the beds and replace the towels."
6408,"Stayed three nights at brand new Hotel Provocateur, and would come back without thinking twice! Tastful design & color concept, very green, quiet and nice patio, super comfy beds & sheets, but first of all by far comes the outstanding nice & charming you staff! We stayed 3 nights and everyone of the team has been outstanding nice and thoughtful! never heard the word ""no"" - always, ""yes"" ! and ""of course"" ! So pleasant!! The hotel concept probably fits better to a younger crowed, but no hipsters... all in all, a very good experience!     "
6409,After a long day we were looking forward to staying at one of the best hotels in Salvador.  The check-in process was painful; took forever and the language barrier was very difficult to overcome.  We paid extra for the 'lounge' on the top level expecting a concierge-type experience and there was nothing there.  The hotel air conditioning was very poor; my room was sweltering when I opened the door and it never really got cooled off.  There weren't many nearby amenities and we didn't feel safe in the vicinity of the hotel after dark.  I'm surprised that Sheraton actually agreed to put their name on this place; it is by far the worst Sheraton I have ever stayed.  We moved hotels after two days. 
6410,"This was still a fairly new hotel when we visited. Location was great, our room had an awesome view of the beach and the Lady Buddha statue. The staff at the front counter upon check in were very friendly, with some international staff hired to help the local staff with running the hotel the correct way for an SPG hotel. The pool and bar were beautiful, with amazing views, however the pool does not get a lot of sun, which is great for preventing sunburn but it does mean that the water is very cold.  One very large problem did occur. Neither of us got very much sleep due to the fact that once the room lights were turned off, the bright green flashing light from the smoke detector in the room cut through the darkness like the worlds brightest laser. Every 10 seconds or so the room…"
6412,"Everything is great with this place. Perfect cost-benefit relation. Great breakfast, great people, great attention and great location, close to the Eiffel tower and with a nearby metro station. I was very happy with my stay here."
6413,"One of the greatest properties in the world ! An unique setup that cannot be compared to any other property. I have enjoyed several stays in this hotel and have seen over the years how the human factor in relation to service has deteriorated. The attitude, the lack of commitment and performance was so strong that I will not return. The rooms are also in the need of a caring touch and the cleanliness could also be improved. However the worst issue is the staff with the worst team at the restaurant. My review is based on a stay of 5 nights and daily incidents at breakfast, room service and technical problems in the room. Shower not working, water leak etc etc. A pity because it is a remarkable property but the performance not worthy the brand of Leading Hotels of the World!"
6415,When we booked here I hadn't realised it's really two hotels in one. In the Plaza section you literally go down rabbit hole like corridors depressingly small. Once we reached the room the overall accomodation was ok but we literally looked out at a brick wall. Also be careful to tell reception you would like sheets/towels changed as they only routinely do this every three days!! The hotel is right next to a very noisy restaurant & in the evening hearing the reception staff is virtually impossible. I don't know how they manage to think it's so noisy. Location wise the hotel is ok & it was easy to get around & hop on the free Trams circulating the city.  On the plus side there's Molton Brown goodies in the bathroom & free coffee/ croissants/toast after ten am in the mezzanine &…
6416,"Everything you could possibly want from a hotel this close to the station. The staff were lovely, the decor was inspiring and interesting and the bed super comfortable.  We didn’t get to try breakfast but would definitely recommend this hotel. A total pleasure."
6417,"I could have stayed any where in Lisbon for our 5 nights away,this looked good on TA. However,no previous contributors mention the direct flight path or that it seems to get the majority of its business from group tours,conventions and day seminars. Why should this matter? 5 star hotels I am familiar with have staff that address you by name, including the manager who would be talking to guests, and have staff keen to provide service.Not so here, apart from Ricardo at the door and the ladies at reception.They also do the job of a concierge. A dying pigeon roamed the pool area among the children for 24 hours until I threatened to finish it and bag it. Our cups from home disappear from our room one day, next day, the kettle,next day my bathroom robe,all to returning eventually.…"
6418,"Location 10/10, the administration 10/10. We were absolutely happy in this hotel! Hope to come back here again and again.  I dont know what else to say, so im writing something to tripadviser. :)))))))  Good bey see u soon"
6419,The Bathroom door wouldn’t close without force. The Closet door was off of the track. The toilet leaked during our entire stay. There was also a raw sewage stench from the lobby and throughout the hotel. Will never stay here again and would not recommend this hotel unless some major renovations were done. 
6420,"Loved the hotel!  Large rooms, amazing shower, large bathroom, quiet and so close to Alexanderplatz. Wifi is also super fast and easy to use.  Rooms on fourth floor facing the courtyard are totally quiet!   Minor issue was the pillows, which are so flat they’re quite useless.   Everything else was beyond our expeditions and perfect.  Great room in a great location."
6421,"The room was super small, the bathroom door wasn't closing properly, the electric panel was making too much noise, I complained but nothing has been done during our stay.  The location is very nice though and the staff very friendly."
6422,They have amazing team like Julie and marguerite . AMAZING EXPERIENCE!!!! All the best. Best food and best time in Cannes. I will continue visiting this hotel with my self or my family. I like every thing there and the just Renovation the hotel rooms 
6424,The staff is so nice!   For 2 people who are not a couple it is better to ask for a room with two separate beds. You have more space!   The hotel is very noisy.  No isolated walls.   The breakfast is normal but not my kind of perfect breakfast.  The bathroom is very small.   The location is very good. Next to the yuyungarden and 15 min walk to the bund. Perfect! 
6425,"I can tell that this is the worst hotel I have ever been. Reasons: my bed had hairs in between the sheets. The pictures from Expedia absolutely DO NOT match what you are getting. The elevator from The Tower Of Terror in Disney is way safer than the one they have here. The price is not justified at any means, you can get better hotels for the same price or lower. The lamp on my side of the bed didn't worked. The lighting of the room is awful. If you are up to paying a lot for getting nothing, this is the place for you."
6426,"The One Barcelona does tick all the boxes and does almost everything right. The welcome from the front door was fantastic and the checkin was warm, speedy and efficient. The rooms and bathrooms are spotlessly clean and well appointed. Only one negative the bar services is veeerrrrry sloooooow. First occasion after 10 mins we gave up waiting for service and just left. On the second occasion I set the timer on my iPhone and we were asked what we would like to drink after 13mins. They saw the timer running and the drinks were back within 1min 34secs, Wow!! Finally, the location is great."
6427,Very nice designed hotel. Helpfull and attentive staff. Comfortable rooms. Well situated: not in a very busy neighbourhood but metro and restaurants at reasonable walking distance. Only minus: there was a coffee machine but no tea making facilities....
6429,"This is a large hotel, beautifully decorated and with really helpful staff. We particularly enjoyed politely being advised of the need to be 'textile free' if we wanted to use the sauna.:)  The rooms are large and they had accommodated my request for two and three separate beds (not doubles) in respective rooms that were situated just along the same corridor. This was perfect for a group of five friends.  There is a good supply of toiletries, with a hairdryer, plus tea and coffee. The beds were extremely comfortable, with crisp white cotton bedding and what felt like (with a slightly crackly noise) goose down quilts and pillows. Although you are adjacent to a large road and tram interchange, there is very little noise in the rooms.  Small niggles: shower temperature a bit…"
6430,"Our stay at the joke hotel was fantastic! We stayed in Paris for a week and it really felt like home. We were able to have a great breakfast each morning before our day! We were also in Paris during the week of record high temperatures and the air conditioning couldn’t have been more appreciated!   We also booked a 3 person room which wasn’t available, but the manager gave us a second room to better accommodate us even though we we didn’t use it- very thoughtful.  Highly recommend going and the only place I’ll stay again in Paris. "
6431, I think it was located at a more quiet side of Mitte away from most of the eatery and hip places were. However that wasn't so mug of a problem for us as the metro was very close to the hotel i.e. Just across the street. Room was clean but was expecting the toilet to be bigger which reminded me of an Ibis hotel bathroom. Although the room still came with extras like sewing kit and complementary water & beer. Overall we enjoyed it.
6432,"Knowing that hotel rooms run small, we chose to pay the premium for a Large room at Max Brown based on their website's description, ""extra spacious... extra sofa-bed ... you can easily fit a party of three"". What we got was a narrow slot of a room, 3-6' wide, with maybe ~25sf usable floor space, and a double bed walled in on 3 and ½ sides. The sofa bed ~ 4' long, sized for a hobbit or small child. Hardly what we expected. Not at all like the photos on the website.  That said, you can't beat the location, just a block from the Rijksmuseum and a tram stop, good pubs and restaurants a 10 - 20 minute walk way, and a helpful, friendly staff.  Despite its good qualities, I regard the room description as borderline bait-and-switch, and so can't  recommend this hotel."
6433,"The staff is very friendly, the hotel is clean, and has a familiar atmosphere. However, the construction is a little bit outdated, the price is not cheap, and what bothered us was the fact that they don't have a parking lot, and all the nearby street parking spots are charged. Either way, we had a great stay in this hotel, and we recommend it to couples and family travelers."
6434,"Nice front staff 'Amelia' who is very friendly, helpful and cozy. The room is contemporary and clean. The bed is nice and comfy! Overall everything is good. Walking distance to the city center about 15-20mins. "
6436,"Very comfortable hotel and good access to Alexanderplatz and the public transport system. The hotel was clean and nicely finished, great coffee, but really really noisy. I unfortunately had a room on the street side of the hotel and each and every time a tram passed it felt like it was traveling through my room!"
6437,"I choose this hotel due to its proximity of the famous shopping mall KaDeWe and it is literally 5-10 minutes walking. The hotel is nice, the rooms are well equipped.  The breakfast buffett is outstanding in its variety. I can totally recommend it!"
6438,Nice trendy hotel in quiet street not far from main shopping are of charlottenberg. Do your research and it easy to get to we got train from Airport SXF to Zoologischer Garten for 5.30 euros for two of us then it is less than ten minutes walk. Check in really quick and staff friendly rooms are immaculate and roomy the free drinks are a nice gesture but you won't be partying in the room on 1 bottle of lager plenty of restaurants nearby and had breakfast at the end of road on corner really good . wifi not too good in room 112 and only complaint was this room is above the bar and you can hear the noise so not good option if you are a light sleeper
6439,"We stayed four nights and were very satisfied with everything. The room was pretty and clean, bed very comfy and the service very kind. Location was excellent and we walked everywhere - but the metro stop is also very near. We only had breakfast once since we wanted to try different places - but it was so nice that next time we'll probably eat there more often. We already decided we'll come back. There were some minor details that would make the hotel feel even more luxorious - like offering hair conditioner, and using real drinking glassea instead of the disposable plastic cups - but nonetheless, 5/5!"
6440,"My family and I stayed the night here on July 12, 2014 for my sister's bachelorette party. HAD A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!  During check-out on Sunday, July 13th, the front desk clerk made a HUGE mistake and over-charged by card by over $700.00 in 3 separate charges. At first - the manager was nice to contact my bank and speak with them - which took almost 2 hours- but he was unable to have the charges immediately reversed. He promised that the Hotel would not charge my account anything until the whole matter was cleared up. That following Thursday, not only did the Hotel charge me the correct amount, but overcharged my card AGAIN by another $750.00!! - leaving my account in the red. It took several calls to get in touch with the General Manager wherein he refused to give me a…"
6441,"At this hotel. We come for up to 5 weeks a year. We love the location. We love the staff. We love our apartments, (we have two different ones) what is annoying is the lack of certain conveniences which one would expect of a leading 5 star resort. Things we were promised when the hotel/resort was first built. We were told that there would be shops inside the complex, we have none. You can only buy an English newspaper from reception which they print, this is at an inflated price and is inconvenient, being separate pages stapled together. The internet is virtually non-existent. Very frustrating! The TVs are tiny, set in a huge cupboard! Hardly any English language channels. We used to have them for a while but not anymore. I could go on. These are things which people expect to be…"
6443,"A very busy hostel with lots of movement. I found the rooms very stark and cold, I stayed in a 8-bed dorm room and the shared bathroom was not very clean.  The hostel is in a very ideal location and good for getting to and from the airport. There's a small sausage place at the end of the street which is open till quite late and I cannot recommend it enough!"
6444,"The hotel is ideally situated, 1 minute away from La Rambla and 5 minutes away from Placa de Catalunya. We have found the rooms and the hotel in general old. It looks like it has been built in the seventies and has not evolved since then. It clearly needs renovation work.  Our very positive experience is that, after a terrible first night because of the noise made by other customers, we have shared our experience with the front desk. They took our complaint very seriously and, after having looked for a solution, they have proposed us a Suite. We did not even ask for an upgrade. We have of course been very pleased with this solution and our second night has been excellent."
6445,"Elaine Rothenhaus the worst person to work with groups in the entire world. Really rude, should learn how to be kind before working in the hotel segment.  She is too arrogant to be polite and to treat people as they deserve it."
6446,"The hotel is easy to find, taking the airport bus from Tegel airport. There is a lot  of work going on around the hotel, but as our rooms were away from the main road it didn't concern us. Check in is normally from 3, although we arrived just after 2, and our rooms were ready, which was great. We were on the third floor, rooms 314 and 315. Our rooms were very spacious, and there was a radiator to control the heat levels. There is a TV, however very limited to English channels - only business ones. The free wifi was fine, although you kept having to type in the user and password, when returning to the hotel. The bathroom, consists of a very large bath - very welcome, and a shower in the bath for use. There is no safe, tea/coffee making facilites, or iron/ironing board. There is a…"
6447,First time in Berlin and the Scandic is in an excellent location.  Convenience to the metro is a plus.  Many eating and shopping choices within a five minute stroll from the hotel.  Potsdamer Platz is a fun and comfortable part of Berlin.......Hands down the best breakfast buffet!!!  
6448,"A really nice hotel, close to the metro, and 1 km from the train station (that you can reach by metro, it takes 1 minute), the area is quiet and full of restaurants. The people at the desk is really nice. The rooms big and very clean, beds are really comfortable and with a very big bathroom. More than 100 euro for one room is maybe too much but if you want to be sure about your location, without surprises I really suggest you this hotel. The breakfast costs 12 euro per day per person (crazy considering all the place when you can have it for less) , such as the bike renting. "
6449,"I had a very short stay; in fact it was too short. The front desk was extremely helpful in solving a personal issue. The location is great; the property well maintained; the decor, modern. Road construction in front made it difficult for taxis but this is not the fault of the hotel."
6450,"The hotel is within a short walking distance to metro. You can also have nice walk to the city center. There is a small grocery nearby, and El Corte Ingles and the  beautiful Parque Eduardo is only 1-1,5 km from the hotel. The rooms is nice, wounderful beds and the breakfast is good. BUT, please take care of your belongings.  My ring, a gift from my husband, was unfortunately stolen from my toiletbag in the bathroom. I report it to to receptions desk, but they didn't seem to care about it. I would have given more stare, if it wasn´t for my sad loss."
6451,Great stay in friendly hotel. Nice restaurant And nearby the Metro station. Worthwhile going there. Even a carpark is available. Convenient downtown Paris. We stayed in an executive suite with 2adults and 3 children: 
6452,"There was no adequate information booklet so we continually had to go to staff and ask questions, which were not greeted with the warmest reception.  All we found was a triangle thing that said they was a pool, BBQ area etc, but not where they were and how to get there, what hours of use, and so on.  The pool was a little cooler than I like, and that and the gym were always busy as the complex is mostly residences who use all the areas. The previous guest had obviously smoked in the room or on the balcony as the room had a very stale smell as you walked in each time.  Bathroom was great and clean, great samples given.  Big fridge, good kitchen.  In general it was some of the minor details that really added up to get annoying.  Marks on the wall as you headed into the bedroom, TV…"
6453,"We got a package deal to Kauai.  The room and hotel are not as nice as they are shown in pictures on hotel webpage. The pictures may be taken when the hotel was new or maybe they were polished. In any case, we were somewhat disappointed. The floor is marble that is not maintained and mopped. The bathroom tub is dirty and there is dust collected for days under crevices etc which adds up to the feel of dirty. It is given that the hotel is quiet place to relax and the staff is nice."
6454,Not a 4 star experience. Excellent food though . Not a place to visit if you want a relaxing time especially in the evenings! If you want to leave the hotel it’s a steep steep walk up a very long hill. Also book your own taxi don’t let hotel do it. 
6455,My husband booked this and we were pleased. The rooms were clean and updated. We liked the location. I would only have two things to mention. There is no concierge to help with reservations for restaurants or tours. The front desk staff try to be helpful but they are not all knowledgeable. The other thing I always notice is if the rooms are well equipped with toiletries. The housekeeping staff did not replenish the body cream. We ran out by the third day. It is a little thing but it can be bothersome. Other than that we were pleased.
6456,The lobby is very trendy.  Staff are dressed up casual but friendly. I liked the modern vibe of this hotel. The room is clean and in decent size.  The only problem is room service.  It takes forever to have an attendant to come or does not show up at all.  Just a note that there is no kettle in the room. We only stayed for one night so it was not a big problem. Overall it was a lovely stay and definitely worth the money.
6457,"This place was a utter dump!  I was literally checked in the hotel long enough to find another hotel, approximately 1.5 hours.  This hotel is awful!!!  I wouldn't allow my pet to stay in this place.  The floor lamps were bent, the room(s) (I asked to be moved because, believe it or not, the first room was worse than the second) smelled liked air freshener and cigarettes - which caused my throat to swell and my ears to itch.  Dump!  Dump!  Dump!  I would presume that a Motel 6 would have been a nicer place to stay."
6459,"Yes it was a bit tired and the trek down to the other hotel for dinner was unusual , it was a very steep hill, We always found something we could eat and fortunately I like milk based deserts and fruit.  We did not pay much for this holiday so had a good relaxing time .  The sun beds on the terrace should all be thrown away and the entertainment was odd. And there were not enough chairs to watch it . Staff were very friendly, helpful and hard working. Our view from the 8th floor looking over Funchal was spectacular."
6460,"The good: Good central location, good customer service The bad: Ran down facilities, equal to a 2 star hotel in the US.  Room service food goes from fair to nasty.  The room is OK but there is mold in the bathroom.  Hot water was available most times but not 100% guarantee.  The WiFi comes and goes so bring a LAN cable for your laptop.  If you go by the international hotel rating technically this qualifies as 5 star hotel due to the amenities but the quality of the amenities is way below par say compare to the Intercontinental.    Value is way down for me on cost vs. quality of the hotel."
6461,"This hotel was chosen by my friend, and I was expecting a true 5star hotel.  Is average quality hotel. Maybe I was expecting too much of ""one of the best hotels in town"".  Service: very good and polite, young staff but very helpful. Room: clean and all expected accommodations. Gym: small, lack of stuffs to exercise properly. Pool: lowest point of the hotel. With more than 120 rooms at full capacity, a 5x10m pool with 1.10m depth... the water was disgusting... I was not the only one to reach the pool and get away with the face of disappointment. Breakfast: need more fruits options. Restaurante: poor management... in new year lunch, they said there was 45min delay, but the dishes arrived after 75min... if they know is full capacity, why don't they hire more staff? Location: good…"
6462,"This is an expensive design hotel perfectly placed for Rijksmuseum visit (which is why we selected it). The room we stayed in was a two-level room, with a lot of high-tech which was NOT user friendly. Just finding the right button for all the option is a challenge. Also, the airco in the lowest stand is way too loud, keeps you from sleeping. Also the room (517) was on the inner courtyard so a lot of noise from the reception, lounge and the restaurant. And we DID ask for a quiet room! Turning airco off makes the room too hot. It seems a lot of investment was put into the design, and function was sometimes forgotten... Who needs a mirror on the INSIDE of the toilet door? One advice: if you ask for top money, make sure you get the basics right: a good night's sleep. Then build a…"
6464,"Meininger Tiergarten is a cool hotel which offers you cheap rates and a clean and safe environment. Nothing more and nothing less.  The location super close to Tegel Airport TXL. Taxi costs only 18 EUR from TXL. Apart from that it is not really a central location however it has restaurants (high end to burger joints), grocery stores, a shopping mall etc.  The breakfast is basic but edible.  The rooms are decent. Bunk beds, no phone, no iron but comfy beds and good shower. Most importantly: very very very clean.  The hotel has many groups - mostly school tours and young adults. If"
6465,"A very good, new apart-hotel. We had a large room with plenty of storage space. It was very modern, clean and well-equipped. Great to be able to lift the bed out of the way in the daytime, assuming you are strong enough. The kitchenette was very usable and we were happy having a dishwasher. The area was very quiet as was the inside of our room. Staff were very pleasant and helpful. As for location, we had easy access to the 109 bus direct to Tegel Airport. Also, so easy to access buses, underground or trains to anywhere in the city - Berlin has an excellent public transport system."
6466,This hotel is becoming a little frayed round the edges. The bathroom light was flickering  the television did not work and the marble room threshold was cracked. The staff were very good fixing the light within a couple of hours. The television took longer but it was not for lack of effort on the part of reception and housekeeping.
6468,"We had a junior suite which was spacious and tidy. The noice from the street especially at night was disturbing. During our 3 night visit breakfast wasn´t good at any morning - food was allright but there were always a number of things were run out. The spa was small - that would have been allright but there were no towels one day and the water was freezing. Spa treatment was nice. If I´ll ever go to Riga again, I´ll chooose another hotel."
6470,"Did not enjoy this hostel too much, it is pretty fair from a lot of things and lacks basic amenities... The mattresses are pretty gross and the stairs are reallt steep and winding to get up to the rooms (difficult for luggage, hazard for drinking, etc.) Staff was friendly enough, and no bugs (backpackers know what I'm taking about lol) so that was good..   Wouldn't stay here again, but not terrrrible if you have to stay a night...."
6471,"I arrived in Cannes after a few days in Amsterdam. Had some business in the south of France and Cannes was the first stop before the Film Festival got underway. Because the Cannes Film Festival preparation was underway, it was a bit busy around the hotel but that made it exciting. This is an icon property. I bit old school in it's design but it works very well. Don't change because it has so much history. The pool area was closed because they were getting it ready for a Festival event. The room was very comfortable and I had a sea view. A sea view is a must in this hotel. Make sure you arrange a sea view or you may be disappointed. Breakfast at the Grill was excellent. The staff were superb. I will be back again next year!"
6473,"The beds are too soft for humans.  The housekeeping staff knocks on doors even if you have a do not disturb sign posted.  Front Desk will offer to call you when your room is ready, but they won't.  For the price, definitely look elsewhere.  Stupidity reigns supreme here."
6474,"Beautiful setting, great service. Wonderful bed and comfortable food. Breakfast is good but don't eat any other meals here - overpriced and much better quality and authentic tasting food in local restaurants a short taxi ride away. Hotel is more set up for functions than business training - it fell short in some ways for our session. "
6475,"We spent 3 nights at the hotel. Hotel needs a refurbishment. We had the impression that four stars are very far away. The service to the guests is somehow improvable. For example, if you make a question, you get an answer but no action is following. Just that info. We wanted to send a postal card and needed a stamp; personnel informed how to reach the postal service up to 2/3 blocks from the hotel instead of having a stamp there and handing the card to Correos. In other hotels, we did have this service paying the stamp, of course. Another issue is that we were hosted in a separate part of the hotel and had to carry our luggage to the elevator through a 20 steps (stairs) at least... 3x7. The same when leaving. That is not acceptable because we had to carry the luggage by our own…"
6476,"The facilities are good but facilities need to be updated. The bad: a wild party organized by US citizens that affected the whole 4th floor. The worse: the hotel staff that couldn't do nothing else that tell me: sorry sir but the hotel is all booked and we can't move you to another room (i was beside where the party happened).  After a while and when I ask for the book to complain, they moved me to a room that was far from the noise."
6477,"The location of the hotel is 5mins walk from Cannes SNCF station, 7 mins walk to Cannes harbour. The staff are very friendly and supportive, our 2 room apartment was great, clean and well appointed. Breakfast was very good selection."
6478,"We loved the beds, and bedlinen. The breakfast was super!! We only missed the possibiity to make coffe/tea in the room. The rooms where also very quite. Perfect location, very close to the U-bahn and busses to Tegel."
6479,This place was only a step above a discount hotel.  I've stayed here before and this was THE MOST disappointing Hilton stay ever in my lifetime!! I had to change rooms because of an AC issue. No resolve  
6482,"I stay here regularly for business, but would recommend for tourists as well. The rooms are modern and very comfortable. The food is actually quite good. As other reviewers have noted, the hotel is also very quiet, even when quite busy, which is great for recovering from jet lag.   The hotel is well-located for public transportation and the Berlin Wall Memorial is easy walking distance. The prices vary depending upon whether there is a meeting at the adjacent convention center. However, it is great value if you book at the right time.   While the hotel staff are not the friendliest, they have been very responsive when I've had issues that needed to be addressed.   I will continue to stay here."
6483,"I stayed at this hotel two years ago and it was very charming. I looked forward to returning but I was very disappointed on this trip. When I first entered the room I noticed the windows were filthy and there were strange stains on the wall. I went back to the front desk and asked to change rooms. I was told they were fully booked but to come back tomorrow and they would find a new room. That night and the next morning I discovered the bottom sheet had a hole in it, the comforter had large stains and the shower curtain was moldy. I repacked my bags the next morning and left them with the front desk. They said they would have my new room key when I returned that evening. When I returned the young guy at the front desk retrieved my bag but seemed unaware of the room change. He…"
6484,"A group of 25 of us were camping in Death Valley and some of us stayed in Bishop to rest on Sunday after a long night hike on Saturday. My husband and I booked two nights because we couldn't get an early check-in at 11am and paid for an upgraded patio room.    Since we initially thought we could get an early check-in, we ended up booking through two different sites. The two reservations caused a huge problem for the staff because they weren't trained on their new booking system. I made sure to let them know that we would be sleeping all day after a long night hike and asked to fill out all of the required paperwork on Saturday so that my husband and I weren't disturbed during the day.   The front desk forgot to run my credit card on Saturday for the ""second reservation"" and…"
6485,"Everything nice and mildly clean.  However heads up; all extras are gonna be billed! ( towels, coffees etc )  The environment is really young and noisy, however the walls are quite thick and with some good earplugs I have been able to sleep nicely. "
6486,"This hotel was a bit old. The biulding itself was old, ok! But the inside needs some refurbishment. The elevator was still the old type, where I felt a bit scared; the heater system was also too old;  the bath on the toilet, and all the things in the hotel could be replaced, or at least repaired. Even being clean daily, the aspect of the room was a bit dirty if looked at the first glance. Although, the staff was very respectful, kind and helpful. The bar on the last floor has a great view of the city and it is very charming. A bit cold, though."
6487,"Tried 4 different rooms, could not sleep - A/C can not cool room to comfortable levels - terrible.  Finally, front desk put me in one of the few rooms with old A/C system and Aleluya!   Able to sleep at last!"
6488,"Three nights in early September. Expected a no-frills budget hotel with basic facilities and carbohydrate breakfast. What we got was slightly better with a comfortable & reasonably sized room, effective air conditioning and clean, functional bathroom. Breakfast was chaotic & crowded but acceptable. The location is reasonably central with good bus & metro routes within 2 minutes. A good base for a city break is what we wanted & this is what we got. If you want 5 star, pay for it! Unless you are a culture vulture, don't bother with the well advertised 'Lisboa Card' - Caris the local transport operator do incredibly cheap day or short break travel passes which are obtainable from Metro machines & kiosks with easy to follow instructions (they are in Portuguese but are obvious) "
6489,"A good place to stop over if you are on a budget, All inclusive food was good but basic, inclusive beer was great. The hotel is at the top of a steep slope so beware. We did book a classic room and the room we were given seemed very small so I wouldn't like to see the standard rooms."
6490,"I would recommend this Hotel if you are looking for a clean, reasonably priced no frills accommodation.The Front Desk staff are excellent. The location is excellent as it is close to some good restaurants and reasonably close to the main tourist attractions."
6491,"This hotel would have been a three of four star hotel except for that I was overcharged.  There is nothing special about it. The hotel is close to some attractions, but puerto madero seems to be the safest area in town. The staff is attentive, but the rooms are not the best kept. There are signs of age.  I have a feeling that they have been overcharging many of their US customers.  I hope this is not the case and that it was an honest mistake, but I think they are pulling a fast one, read on. First of all, the bill was not put under my door the last night which is typical in US.  Maybe this isn't typical in Argentina? I got down stairs and i wad presented with a bill in local currency. I was surprised by this since my reservation was quoted in USD.  No big deal. I paid the bill…"
6492,For a family we would not recommend this hotel. In our case a third bed was added to the room which makes the room very tight and further no additional toilet articles or towels were added. The breakfast was lousy and the staff not really helpful.
6494,"Good points: rooms are spotless, the communal areas are stunning, the pool area is great and the staff are very friendly and helpful.  Less good: the price of the food and drinks by the pool is extortionate!  A captive market as there's nothing in the area and boy, do they exploit it. Yes, I expect to pay more but this is London prices 10 e for a slice of cheese on two bits of bread? What a rip off.  Second: the location isn't the best. It's a long walk into Porto and it's an oddly industrial area.- we had workmen on a level with our bedroom window all day, every day. (Not the hotel's fault)  Third: There was a function when we were there and a lot of noise until very late.  Fourth: the breakfast's ok but they watered down the juice and there isn't even a free bottle of water on…"
6496,"Overall, this was a very nice hotel.  The front desk reception was wonderful and helpful.  Location was safe.  Breakfast was very well presented.  Rooms were very comfortable, however, we did have an issue that greatly impacted our visit.  Upon using the hydromassage tub in our room, a large amount of brown substance came out of the jets into the bathwater.  It was disgusting and very upsetting.  We attempted to explain to the maintainence woman, but she insisted it was only the residue from the small bottle of bath salts provided by the hotel.  We asked her to run the jets and see for herself because it was not the salts!  We never heard back from anyone in regards to this issue, so I doubt it was pursued by management.  Unfortunately do to the fact that we had no idea what my…"
6499,"It was a nice hotel in a good location.The rooms aren't big but the design it's great. Restaurant and bar are very fancy,they also gave us free cocktails at the bar for my boyfriend's  birthday. Probably would stay again."
6500,"Arrived at my hotel, decided to sit at the bar to get a drink before heading to my room and was ignored by the ten servers I was trying to flag down that were at the bar for fifteen minutes before I gave up and went to my room.   Gift shop doesn't have toothpaste, doesn't have enough change for other small purchases.  Gave me one hell of an attitude about them not having change for a $100 peso bill at the beginning of their day.  Thanks but no thanks. This isn't what a quality hotel should be like."
6501,"We stayed here recently and wish we didn't, For 3 hundred dollars a night it wasn't worth it! The hotel doesn't have a pool for one thing and if you have kids, I know you know how important that is. Next, the bathtub was filthy! We had to hand wash it ourselves before it could be used. In the morning, there was no hot water. In the afternoon, again there was no hot water. When complaining to the staff, their response was ""Well no one else is complaining"" For the breakfast, they don't serve waffles Friday-Monday, which is one of the reasons we chose a Residence Inn, because of the breakfast and the waffles. Anyone with kids who regularly stays at a Residence Inn does so partly because of the breakfast and waffles, especially if you have kids! I don't know what this building was…"
6503,"My family and I were not excited to stay here. During the time we stayed in this hotel, we got problem with the A/C. When we called the reception to ask fix the A/C. They said we would not need the A/C so we can turn off it. Oh my god, we could not sleep because the weather was too cold. In the next day, no one cared about our problem. We won't recommend this hotel and we won't come back."
6504,"New (only third time ever worn), expensive swimsuit ruined/bleached by too much chlorine in hot tub on 12/27 even though I shower rinsed it in the locker room immediately after getting out of the pool and hot-tub and then machine washed it that night. Swimsuit still smelled of chlorine after going through the washer!! The hot tub was lukewarm and smelled so bad from the chlorine that day my niece didn't want to be in it, and she has been in the same hot tub on many previous stays at the Palace. Complained about ruined swimsuits at front desk and was told ""the pool technicians know what they are doing""-- they refused to compensate or discount stay as recompense. This was on the same trip where they took our luggage upon check-in at hotel and then left us stranded in the city for…"
6505,"This came as part of a good value TravelBird package. We didn’t expect too much and so were not disappointed.  Firstly, the location is pretty much off the beaten track, in a residential area and a car is essential. We drove past four times before we identified the property – maybe we are stupid – but the signage is poor. Parking at the hotel was good. That said you have to like driving on narrow, winding and steep roads which pass along the edges of mountains and through long tunnels. I loved it, my passenger not so much.  Sao Vicente is not worth more than an hour’s visit, maybe a coffee stop. We preferred Santana to the east. That said getting anywhere from anywhere away from the south coast takes and age because of the roads. Driving from Sao Vicente to Santana and back is…"
6506,"The Montmartre Mon Amour is an Excellent hotel, It is located close to the metro with connection to the city center. Is a hotel with an amazing decoration.. Cozy bedrooms with a very good shower, And good staff, all speak english and are very friendly."
6507,"I was very much looking forward to this stay but was utterly disappointed. Unfortunately due to the excessive heat, lack of AC or any sort of air circulation, we ended up having to leave in the middle of the night because it was impossible to sleep in an 100 degree room. In addition, the ""patio"" section of our room was consistently used by staff to place their trash, laundry and used for their ""coffee breaks"". There were actual times in which I had to stay inside my room while I watched the staff use our chairs and tables to engage with each other, drink coffee, and clearly not care that they were using the patio that I paid $300 a night for."
6508,"Maybe my expectations were too high based on the name of the hotel and its presentation on the Accor website, but I found the hotel to be wanting on a number of levels.   I booked a beach-facing room (at a considerable premium to other rooms, understandably), but the room quality was very disappointing: To list:  - There was no kettle or coffee/tea making facility - There were no ironing facilities  - The TV had exceptionally poor reception - There was no bathroom tissue - The room's appearance was very worn (wardrobe, sockets, door frames) - There was no minibar menu (so not clear if the items were free or not), and in a very loud fridge  Hotel information was distributed on a piece of paper at check in, and apart from a room service menu consisting of photocopied papers…"
6509,"Hotel was nice, nothing too special. It was really hard to park om the area even to find any parking place, finally we parked in shopping center 10 min away. Hotel has very good views in the breakfast area!  "
6510,"Stay here for two nights for our last trip for anniversary and celebrate my Birthday before we go home, we flew 16 hours from Singapore to San Francisco, even flying with business class, we still tired with the jet leg. With so many good reviews on Tripadvisor, we have a quite higher expectation with ICSF. Unfortunately, we will NEVER come back here, please refer to the follows timeline for everyone's reference and please think twice or triple before you place your reservation.  Arrived at 4 pm and get into our room around 4:15 pm. 4:15 pm The room was not CLEAN, very dusty everywhere and sticky on the table, we never think about the housekeeping, we think that maybe the air conditioner, no problem, we can clean ourselves. 4:50 pm After we cleaned the whole room (even the…"
6511,"Although our visit was short, it was a great place to stay. Easy to walk to various places, and what I like the most is that the building is secure. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and the apartment was nice and clean! "
6512,"I spend my life in hotels around the world and can honestly say I was floored by the attitude that greeted my at the front desk of the Ritz-Carlton San Francisco.  Worse still, digging deeper into the reviews both here and elsewhere, I can only assume the hotel general manager doesn't care.. The front desk manager has been called out by name for her poor attitude which I have now experienced first hand.  On arriving at the hotel after 24 hr of travel from Dubai, all I wanted was to get a shower and sleep in my pre-paid room.  I got to reception, normal formalities and handed over my credit card after the receptionist asked for a $200 security deposit.  The card was declined, this happens, especially when travelling (security checks etc.)  I said I would call the bank later in…"
6513,Room condition was relatively fine but staff's attidude(her name is Nancy) was terrible. She was not responsible and unkind. She forget to important notice which I asked  and didn't apologize as well. I'm very uncomfortable and upset coz of her rude and terrible attitude. 
6514,"We spent almost three weeks in this hotel. We stayed in one of the ""top floor"" sea facing rooms. Our room was very pleasant with a very nice view. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. The room was very clean but could be updated with more welcoming decor. The view from the room was obstructed by dated planters, with half dead plants and ugly plants allowed to grow too high, which obstructed the view while you sat on the balcony.  The bathroom could do with a revamp. The shower leaked everywhere, until maintenance were notified and rectified the problem, which should have been resolved long ago.  Our air-conditioning was a major issue, it did not work properly and had three visits from maintenance to try and fix it, but there were still problems and it made our stay…"
6515,"Close to Vondelpark and walking distance to the museums and Leidesplien, this is a good location to explore the city.  There are several nice bars and restaurants round the area, and a tram stop on the block so getting around is easy.  Room was small, but comfy and fully equipped.  The beds are super comfy.  The staff are exceptional, friendly and helpful.  Breakfast is ok, fresh bread, ham cheese and yoghurts, but no hot options.  Quite nice, but 15€ seems a bit much.  The living room with its honour bar is really nice place to hang about. My only reservation is the noise.  My room was right next to a door and it seemed to be clacking open and shut all night.  Sound proofing on the room door was really poor, so if you're a light sleeper, then it might not be for you.  Also, if…"
6516,"Stayed at this hotel for a total of four nights, rooms were okay although  if you just take your time to use the Internet you could have located the grand hotel Central Which is the sister company of the central hotel The listed tariff £170 per night however we went on to booking hotel.com and observed the price was only £70 per night quite a drop I thought, Service and the attitude of the hotel staff we found very uncomfortable, recommend therefore You tried the grand central hotel which you will find opposite the Central, hope this helps. "
6517,"Our anniversary weekend ...Labor Day.....Chicago.....super busy weekend for any hotel, but our started off with a rough start.  By no means are either one of us strangers to hotel life, but we hate to complain.....so we didn't.  Our second day we mentioned a few things to this incredibly sweet and professional guest service lady.  Well, Taylor S. you took our concerns to management and within minutes excellent customer service went into overdrive.    The negative complaints we had were quickly remedied ten fold.  Our complaints are in the past, and our anniversary week is changing for the positive.  We have travelled a lot in our many years.........outstanding job.  We thank you.    Special thanks to Taylor S. outstanding guest service with an incredible "" make the guest happy""…"
6518,We spent a few days in Hotel Design Sorbonne and we really loved our stay there. The staff was really nice and helpful to guide us through the city. The hotel location was perfect for us to take the most of our few days in Paris despite the rainy weather. The room was clean and we particularly enjoyed the homemade crepes every morning for the breakfast.
6519,"Second time staying here for holiday and will come back again. Everything works and is in place, people are polite, the interior is cozy Scandinavian and kept clean - and the location close to KaDeWe etc. and the Wittenbergplatz U-Bahn -station, but still away from the noise of traffic is great. Connected rooms with own private part of the  corridor is an excellent choice for four (when available).  "
6520,"I liked the location, we were only a few minutes walk to the trains, buses and the Christmas market at zoo garten. room was nice and had all the amenities such as safe, bed was comfortable, great shower. staff were friendly and I liked that we were given free use of umbrellas when it was raining. breakfast was fine, plenty of choice. tv reception was not great on the English channels and room temperature switch made noise when turned on so it got a bit too hot during the night. Gym is small and not many weights but its ok."
6521,"I loved. Feels like home. The common area it's really good, you can have a lovely end of the day in the hostel, playing, meeting new people, eating and relaxing with a movie. Everything is planned to guarantee the security of your stuffs. The atmosphere is good, all the staff are willing. The bedrooms are good, although i had some small problems, all of them were resolved. The location is perfect to go everywhere by walk but there are many metro stations around. I will definitely come back."
6522,"this hotel is an average 4 star Mercure hotel. Nothing more nothing less. The rooms are clean. Stayed in suite 323. Very god space, nice with"" two ""rooms if you travel with kids.  The breakfast is as it should be. An ok selection of cold and warm food. Nice and clean. The staff is friendly and helpfull. No information about allergenes on the buffet. If you would like gutenfree bread you have to ask the staff.  We did not know.  The hotel is close to Berlin Mall and check point charlie."
6523,"The shower was interesting. Hot then cold then hot......... Put in a plumbing manifold and a thermal control - and make it even. The business traveler just wants a nice bed, a decent shower and a place to have breakfast. You did great on the bed and the breakfast but the shower was a disaster.   Other than that, the room was great. The breakfast was excellent. "
6524,"I have been a Hyatt member for many years spending a lot of money over those years for business trips. The Hyatt has now lost all of our trust and will never be staying at a Hyatt again. We had a flight cancelled due to a snow storm 2 hours before departing. We called the Hyatt to let them know we needed to reschedule our stay. The front desk said they didn't know how to do that so they transferred us to the manager. The manager, Aaron, did not return any calls. We called 9 times leaving voicemails to both the general manage and assistant. When we finally reached them we could hear them in the background to tell their front desk agent that they were unavailable. As each day passed Hyatt declined to rebook our stay saying the day has passed. We had proved to them multiple times…"
6526,"Do not use the wifi in this hotel.  It is not secure.  I did and my email was hacked by spammers, sorting it out has been a nightmare.  Hotel rooms are basic and noisy.  Bathroom very grim, complete with ants on 14 floor!  This is a one star business hotel.  However, lovely bar and pool overlooking the beach and the staff could not be more helpful or lovely."
6527,"I'll start by pointing out what we really liked about the hotel: the location was amazing, on a very modern area with lots of hotels nearby. And the station is located just a stone's throw away, which gives you access to the all public transport  quickly. Additionally it has elevators, which is a huge plus in Amsterdam, and they work perfectly. The downside of it was that the staff wasn't neither very nice nor helpful - weird for Dutch people - we had issues with the room (no idea why we got assign to a room for disabled guests, which had alarms... You can guess what happened). Cleaning of the room could also have been better.  And organization... Wasn't all that organised - almost seemed that they didn't know what room they got you. Also... In my opinion, lockers for your…"
6528,"Spent 4 nights here and found the hotel to be, in a good location; nice size room; clean; friendly staff; excellent food; good choice of breakfast food and above all good value.   So, defiantly recommend giving this one a look if your planning a trip to Berlin."
6529,"This hotel was very clean. I enjoyed my time spent here staff was extremely pleasant and more than willing to help with required needs.I would gladly return to this hotel when revisiting this city, I found it very close to the subways to get us too any landmarks we wanted to visit.We was surround by many cafes restaurants so food was never a problem."
6530,"The location CANNOT be beat.  The hotel is within walking distance to Notre Dame Cathedral and The Pantheon.  There are so many restaurants within walking distance.  To get around the city the METRO is also close.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place.  The size of the room was a little small but plenty of room for my husband and I."
6531,"i have never stayed at a place which was more chill and laid back than at the Moxy. Let me tell you, what blew me away was how kind and professional the staff was, they literally took care of us and they made us feel right at home. Definitely coming back here!!! "
6532,"We chose this place mostly for the price, as I'm a budget traveler (who refuses to stay at hostels), and it happened to be in a great location, so it was a no brainer. We got to the hotel (by train, from the airport) about an hour before check-in and were a bit disappointed that they didn't let us into our rooms since most hotels have them ready close to check in time, but they did let us store our bags which was great! I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. The room itself was amazing and clean, and we definitely thought it was a bargain for the price of places around it. Theres a bar/restaurant on the first floor which we didn't get to enjoy but looked very nice/upscale. The hotel is within walking distance to many attractions and the train stop is close by as…"
6533,"What a beautiful hotel, thoroughly enjoyable stay. Hotel is immaculately clean, in a lovely quiet but accessible location with a Fantastic view of the Odéon Théâtre de l'Europe from our room window, helpful staff and well equipped and comfortable rooms"
6534,"The location was very good, with lots of transport links close by.  A comfortable and clean room with an average continental buffet breakfast included.   The only thing was it was a bit expensive, because they hiked up the prices for the football Euro 2004. "
6535,"I stayed for two day in a junior suite, the room was okay (really clean) but the bathroom is far from a five star hotel maximum a three. The staff was friendly but the gentleman at the bar. Very good breakfast included at the rate. For my surprise the hotel doesn't have a restaurant."
6536,"Overall very good apartment , nice location but poor elevators . If more than 2 people ride elevator it gets stuck. Nice bathrooms . Rooms clean . Little pricy  Close to train station .  Would recommend to others                       "
6537,"Cannot recommend this hotel. Although the location was great and service fine, the hotel creaks in the wind!  3 of our 6 nights were disturbed from loud creaking!  We were told it’s a design fault of the building. Brackets were used for earthquakes but they move with wind. Very disappointing. "
6539,February 2018: the second time we stayed at a double private room with private shower and it was fantastic! The room has the ideal size and it is very clean. The television makes the difference when you want to be in touch with German. The localization is the best in town! The staff is very friendly. We would certainly recommend it!
6540,"Hotel is in a great location but rooms need urgent upgrade. AC is old and doesn't work properly, TV also not good, bathroom clogged. Breakfast also could be better.  Communication between front desk and maintenance is also poor. "
6541,"This is an excellent hotel, well situated in an affluent part of Lisboa. Walking distance to center 20 minutes. Our room was fine with a good view of the Edward VII park. However, two days in a row our room was not cleaned. The first day we had a clean the room sign on the door. The second day we had no sign on the door. Our complaint was met with a nonchalant ""sorry"". Our friends who asked for a change of room also received a rather cold response. The staff need a course in politeness and smiles. The breakfast was fine except for a non-satisfactory cooked ham."
6543,"I contacted the hotel and had them reserve rooms for us.  When we arrived, they were expecting us, so that's a plus since some of the hotels we had reservations didn't recognize us until I show them emails them.  I find the rooms adequately large and clean.  However, room functionalities seem to be in disrepair.  For example, we had to move to three different rooms to find one with a functioning air conditioner.  Each time, we had to argue that only warm air comes out of the unit. They seem to believe that all you need from an AC is flowing air, regardless of temperature.  Sinks clogged.  Ants crawling around floors and walls.  Tried to put us in rooms with no windows and AC.  Most disappointing for me was that the laundry service was totally unacceptable.  They mix guests…"
6544,- Smiling and welcoming staff  - Clean and very spacious room - right next to metro station (few steps away To Poissonnière station and the 7th line) - Very close to Gare du Nord (a little more than 600 meters away) - Overall very good location  - Coffee machine with complimentary capsules
6546,"From the first glance, the hotel looked good but... We were given a room with walkable balcony and no privacy (not sure whatever it was a walkable alley but jumping kids did not care), later moved to a different room with... no conditioner.  First ever time when we had prescribed medications stolen from the room.  Found only one person who was able to speak English. When we arrived the cheerful manager greeted us with a phrase he was repeating non-stop: ""Bahboh pee"" - in 5 minutes we realised that the manager was asking for our passports please. Yes, they do now speak English at all.  Their tourist office was tried to charge us for the tour we didn't book.  Ans the last thing - the beach was super dirty. Get ready you relax next to cigarette butts, used tissues and plastic…"
6547,"The hotel has a good location, not on the Bund but 10 min walk from it and also close to shopping streets. Don't be fooled by taxi drivers at the airport. A proper taxi car is often red or light blue or light green and the car will look really run down, they will start the meter. Don't get in a taxi that doesn't have a meter. We were fooled our first time and had to pay 200 RMB to get form the airport to the hotel. On our way from the hotel to the airport we had a proper taxi and paid 40 RMB.  The staff are OK, the rooms are quite run down, the wifi is almost not working at all, the views are OK, we didn't try the breakfast. If you get this hotel at a good price I guess it's a good alternative to be close to where the action is but I would not exactly recommend it to anyone."
6548,"Amazing amazing amazing!!!! We really enjoyed our stay, perfect for a romantic vacation.  Check-in was fast and professional, the room was clean and bed comfortable. Receptionist Anna gave us very nice advises and recommendations :) Breakfast was nice, location - the best! We definitely will come back - they made our vacation and we want it to repeat."
6550,"I was very disappointed.  There's often a long wait for the elevator to and from the rooms in the annex due to lines of people trying to get to the cabana.  The ""lockers"" in our room had dust on the bottom shelves.  The separate shower room is great in theory but has no ventilation, quickly turning it into a steam room.  The room sink is cool to look at but provides no space to place items in use, such as the hairdryer, which kept slipping off the tiny table next to the sink.  The staff in the second floor lounge were often rude.  One criticized my cousin's taste in beer.  We had a group of dozens staying at the hotel and would gather there nightly, spending quite a bit on drinks over several hours. Yet when I brought back cookies for the group to have with their drinks, I was…"
6551,"Having stayed at the Westin St. Francis a number of times over the years, I recently decided to stay at the hotel for a weekend trip to San Francisco with some friends.   My friends mentioned the front desk clerk was very rude to them at check in.  I was not there at the time this occurred.  However, I did speak with the front desk over the phone to resolve their issue.  In my room, the bath mat was severely stained, in my mind, calling into question the cleanliness of the room/bed. At checkout, the valet was very slow, claiming they were busy despite not one vehicle coming or going during the time we spent waiting for our vehicle.    I get issues can happen.  The most concerning part was the response I received from hotel management.  A response I viewed to be insincere and one…"
6552,"Arrived  late omFriday night to friendly staff and quickly taken up to the room. The room 308 was modern, bed was decent enough and mini bar had some interesting contents.   1) aircon was a bit dated and struggled to cool the room, this was okay but for warmer months one would struggle  2) There were no hooks to hang towels.. we literally were hanging them on the door knobs  3) I enjoy dog friendly hotels but think guests should not be allowed to leave the dogs in room unattended for more then e hours as we had a dog barking in room 301 for most the time we were there. We did mention this to the receptionist.  Breakfast was fun, fresh pastries and a good selection of meats, cheese and coffee. The service during breakfast was very good.  The private function downstairs was a…"
6553,"We recently stayed at this hotel in Poblenou, it is in an authentic part of Barcelona & I liked this, we were welcomed by the reception staff who were extremely polite & made us feel welcome.   I liked the hotel but felt as though it lacked the luxuries which we have experienced in other Melia Hotel recently (Palma & Seville). The room was nice & quiet and the service was excellent.   I did find it frustrating at times having to wait for the lifts, we were on the 14th floor of 26. For the duration of our stay, Tuesday - Friday two of the lifts were out of order, consequently the wait for lifts was excessive and often they were full and quite uncomfortable.   The breakfasts were excellent, the staff welcoming and that made a lovely start to our day. The pool area looked nice, we…"
6554,"Was on our honeymoon, expecting to be blown away by our room, which unfortunately ended up being so low down the mountain , an average room for the price paid, with a tiny balcony, and an even tinier spa. The view from the balcony was blocked of by the rest of the building.....The rest of the property though is divine. Staff too were fantastic. .not to mention that awesome pool. But better rooms with better views can be found with a third of the price"
6555,"Room was okay, clean but smelled like damp and no window. Bathroom clean, very small and shower door won't close because sink is in the way.  At 6:30 am they started construction work on the hotel. Drilling, banging on the walls,... Good way the wake everybody and piss of your guests! "
6556,"My husband and I stayed here for the last three nights of our honeymoon. We had read a bunch of reviews about how the rooms were decorated by local artists and it is located right in the thick of most of the action (read: right next to the Red Light District and about a 20 minute walk from anywhere you want to go) Amsterdam has to offer.   The location is great. Unlike other days when we were staying further out of town, we didn't need to utilize any public transport and weren't killing our feet walking constantly.   The room itself was a private double with an ensuite bathroom. The size was small but not cramped, you're not spending all that much time in the room as it is. However I did feel a little let down that the way our room was decorated was pretty subpar compared to the…"
6557,"modern, tastefully decorated apartments, light and bright,  on arrival can upgrade if available as units are different, we were shown 4 different ones and decided on smaller bathroom for bigger kitchen. Clean and well maintained Deserves more than 2 stars"
6558,"Just spent a week here. First time in Berlin so didn't really know what to expect in relation to surroundings, and booked the Ku' Damm 101 as it was cheap and I'd read a few recommended reviews.  Like Berlin itself, I found the hotel clean and the people / staff friendly. No issues at all. I had access to free Wi-Fi at all times (up to 300mb per day, enough for emails and facebook). Rooms were cleaned every other day which was fine. Bed comfortable with 2 pillows (very soft!). Hot water at all times. I never used the restaurant in the hotel, as it was quite expensive, but there are lots of choice nearby. Only gripe during my stay was a couple of mornings, workers nearby started at 7.30am which was fine with me but folk that party may have been woken. Not the hotels fault, unless…"
6559,Lovely looking modern hotel. Very well insulated and quite. 4 stops away on the train from city centre.  The rooms are small and no coffee or tea in rooms.  Breakfast is expensive at 11 euros for continental- better to walk down the road for 5 mins for a better breakfast and a lot cheaper.  I would use again and recommend  with these points in mind 
6560,"The hotel is 5min walk to the metro.  The rooms a good size with a waterfall shower.  The hotel has a pool (unheated) with large massage jets, sauna and steam room with heated seats included in the stay.  We enjoyed this very much at the end of long day of walking.  The hotel is on a quiet street, but is surrounded by shops and restaurants.  I would say here again when I return to Paris."
6561,"We loved this hotel, great staff, great breakfast, great location, great value for money, Great room except the room was far to hot and couldn't be controlled separately it was  uncomfortable. The helpful staff make this hotel, we would stay again and would recommend it for short stay. Great location for the Zoo and easy to get into city center. Lots of places to eat out - we used the Chinese next door, the Steak house 2 doors down and the pasta & pizza place 600 yards down the road all good and mid-range price wise"
6562,"I have stayed at several Nh properties and countless other hotels throughout Europe, Asia and the Americas.  One item that stood out at this Nh was the complete lack of open customer accessible electrical outlets at  either the desk or bedside.  I had to unplug a floor lamp on the desk side of the room to charge my mobile phone and tablet, and to unplug the desk lamp for my laptop.  Like many, I use my phone as my alarm clock while it charges; but this was across the room from the bed.  Disappointing..."
6564,"We arrived Friday night at 23h. Our children were tired and it took the reception 30 minutes to do the checkin! Then arriving in the rooms, for 1 room the entry cards did not work and both rooms were not ready. Mind you, Friday night 23h!! 1 room missed 1 complete bed and 1 room missed pillowcases.  Went back, they promised to fix in 10m. We went for a drink next door. Came back an hour later, a dirty mantras was dumped in the room, with no bedding. The other room still missed the pillowcases.  Etc etc etc. only at 2h we had all taken care off. they don't care for clients. Only the staff at the breakfast and the concierge were friendly and helpful.  The renovated pool on the roof opened Sunday and this looks really nice.  I certainly won't go back there. "
6565,"My first conract with IBIS hotel(s) was in Luxemburg, being on bussines trip (European commision, 4 years ago), I needed a hotel near airport, not expensive, but clean....with bathroom and toilette...to spent a nigt, to rest.. Ibis Lux was perfect.  So, next trip to Luxemburg...again IBIS. And when my wife and I planned a trip to Spain for 15 days....IBIS chain was the first choice. And this choice was the best choice ever...relatively cheap, clean, with parking place(s).....good breakfast, dinner at your choice..."
6566,"This hotel is without a doubt, the worst Accor hotel that I have stayed.  Room: tired looking room . Old.  Breakfast: limited variety . Hardly a 5 star hotel standard.  Front desk: insisted on charging a guest about 100 SGD for early check in at 8 despite having rooms that are available. Efficient in revenue management but sucks in customer retention.  Only saving grace is the service of a porter Ying Jun who was spot on with his information and his concern for his customer""s tiredness."
6567,"A fine hotel, very impressive lobby, good reception, the Junior suite was impressive, good towelling and bedding and wifi. The breakfast was not impressive, better variety required for vegetarian, they do have options for hot omelets. "
6568,"Very good location, just minutes away from galleries lafayette and place madeleine and Opera Garnier but situated in a quiet neighborhood. Best of all, the staff treats you well like family. They were always very attentive to our needs. We almost missed our day tour to the Loire Valley if not for Eric, who was at the reception and who kept calling the tour company who was supposed to pick us up from the hotel. We will stay again when we get back!"
6569,"Let me just start off by saying that my friends have been staying at this hotel since 2012. We always stay on the same days, because we come down for TBOX since we are on the royal court.  We had booked a weekend to stay at the majestic. Never have had issues before them, but literally if they were to check the account they would see we have been going there for 6 years.   FRIDAY. We check in. We had a King Room, with a pull out couch. we had 4 of us. Not a big deal we do this every year. Around 4 in the morning, we were all woken up by a loud crash, and what sounded like someone was taking a shower. MIND YOU WE ARE ON THE TOP FLOOR (THIRD). All of us got woken up, and we had to be up by 6 am to start TBOX. So awoken from slumber, we were all trying to figure out where this came…"
6570,"To whaleisland resort operator I have booked the room via Agoda. Unfortunately, the date was input wrongly ( checking date is May 1st instead of 2nd ). I really do not know how to make it changed. Then I did contact directly to the number posted on your home page. The answer I recieved confused me so much. The guy, who gave the answer, said he has nothing to do with the case and asked me to deal with system by myself in a very inresponsible manner. My point of view: even though i booked via Agoda but you are the final service provider. it is no harm to you if you can create more supportive attitude toward potential customer from the very first time that we keep in touch. I saw some negative comments on Tripavisor about your service. But i think i may be isolated cases. Service…"
6571,"This hotel has a crazy policy of cancelling your already booked and prepaid room if you are not there by 12:00am. I arrived just after 12:00am to learn of this policy, by which time the hotel already sold my room to someone else. Apparently this is in the fine-print when booking but I failed to read this ridiculous policy. Meanwhile every hotel in the Chicago area was booked and I ended up out of town in a nearby city. The woman at the front desk only offered apologies. No water. No help finding a room. Nothing. I will never return to this hotel or this chain again."
6572,"Great location for transport links - about 4km from the airport, and 2 mins walk from the metro and Oriente train station.  The workers on reception, during arrival and departure were excellent- really friendly, and made an effort to make me feel very welcome at the hotel.  The room itself was a good size- clean, and comfortable- with a good view over the train station right behind the hotel.  As I was visiting outside of the tourist season, the hotel was catering for the many business travelers that the visit Oriente for the large company offices across the road.  This meant that the hotel felt a little sterile- but I guess it's very different in the summer months.  I was mildly disappointed with breakfast, in that there was a real lack of seating, co-ordination, and…"
6574,"We stayed at the Hotel Angleterre for four nights, and had a good stay. It's well located, just down the road from Checkpoint Charlie on Fredrichstrasse, in the centre of Berlin. There's an underground station almost right outside, plus a number of coffee shops where you can get a cheap breakfast. There's also a small off-licence just next door. The hotel is clean and tidy, and the staff are all very helpful and speak good English. The rooms are a decent size, with a very large television on the wall. First night, we needed more pillows, but a bilingual note to the cleaners sorted that out. We had problems getting the safe to open and close, and eventually gave up on it. We ate in the attached restaurant one night, and it was good, and reasonable priced. We couldn't see any of…"
6576,"I stay often at Hilton properties but after my experience at this Hilton I am having second thoughts.  Several staff members were rude and the work is of poor quality with many mistakes.  Instead of making one reservation, a staff member made duplicate reservations for 2 nights, beginning one day before the intended stay, then skipped one night, and then for four additional nights, essentially leaving us without a room in the middle of the stay.  Luckily I called two days before the intended stay, and was surprised to learn about the four separate reservations (I needed one) that skipped a day and started a day before we were going to arrive. After spending 3 hours on the phone one of the managers, Fabiola, was able to fix the reservation.  However when we arrived we got checked…"
6577,Hotel was just ok expected more got less.   A hotel that wanted to Fleece us on everything. For a trip to Sugarloaf they wanted to Seniors to pay 280R round trip. We paid 70R for Sugarloaf and 16R for UBER a total of 86R. NOTE the Taxis are out to rip you off like this Hotel. Call UBER to get you to the airport or this hotel will want Double what a taxi would charge and Triple on what UBER would charge.   I had to call down three times in the matter of an hour just to get towels.   Wifi was not very good.   They overcharged (Fleeced)for the money exchange charged 100R for 200USD That is Triple on what the Money exchange on the next block charged us.   The Front desk person got mad a us because we could not understand her and snapped at us.   They did not tell us how much the…
6578,"I was in Rio for the Caixa Marathon and stayed for one night at this 5-star hotel. What a disappointment! Check-in time at 3 pm and check out the following day at 12 noon sharp, no late check-out allowed, which means I paid an outrageous daily rate of around USD 300 for a 21-hour stay at a very basic no frills stinky room! The staff is not rude but far from being nice and welcoming. I paid USD 45 for two sandwiches and a coke!!! I am aware that Brazil is not a cheap country, but this hotel - more like 4 stars than 5 - is definitely awfully expensive. Forget the Sheraton Barra when you make your plans to visit Rio - stay somewhere else, say , the Windsor Hotel next door. I will definitely not go back."
6580,"I stayed at Varandas for few days, I didn’t pay attention to the room description because I was enchanted by the pictures that I have seen. The property is beautiful and brand new and the location is absolutely great. But the rooms with no view are not exactly what I would recommend. There is never fresh air coming in the room from the outside, no mirror so is always necessary go to the external bathroom. The room was extremely small. Air conditioning is really noisy so I suggest earplugs. For the price that I paid I was expecting more but as I said, my experience is conditioned by the type of room, staff was really nice and the place well cleaned."
6581,"Reception staff were helpful on arrival, rooms are nice and clean, abit annoying we had to and ask for the shower gel to be replaced, bar was nice but was busy one night and the bar staff couldnt control it which was abit frustrating.  Me and my partner would recomend this hotel overall it was lovely. "
6582,The hotel was much shabbier than the photgraphs portrayed.  We didnt have a great deal of choice but to stay there so asked to view the rooms beforehand.  The first room smelt of sewerage. They gave us two more choices and we eventually settled on the third one but it was not like the one shown on the website that we had booked.  Breakfast buffet menu had very little choice and we ended up going out even though we had chosen B&B - we were so dissappointed with the breakfast meal we decided not to have any evening meals there.
6583,"I like the place because of the quiet and comfort I had during the stay, location is great and though the rooms are small but good enough if you stay alone and don’t have guests to visit you. Food quality and taste is great but it’s more like something between self service and assisted. It would be great if they serve the breakfast on the table."
6584,"This splendid hotel is situated in the heart of Paris,  very close to the Arc de Triomphe and the Metro. The most important places of Paris metro can be reached in 10 minutes.  The hotel is very clean and the staff smiling and helpful (especially the lovely brunette :)  Room in the Empire style very bright and spacious , tea and coffee making facilities available . Beds extremely comfortable . The room was cleaned thoroughly every single day.  Ironing room very handy to us . Overall a very good judge ."
6585,"Nice rooms, very good breakfast, super staff, great views of Berlin from the rooftop bar.  Only issue was the noise from the patio area of the restaurant late at night when they were setting it up for breakfast the next morning.  Otherwise, excellent service and amenities."
6586,the price is okay for amsterdam; hostel is central in the city; service well; room is smart; breakfast to small but tasty; stair is to long but i know you can`t change it;  bathroom and toiletts are clean
6587,The hotel was nice if not a bit dated. Well kept gardens but room cleaning could be improved. The location was very goid enabled easy access to different sides of Funchal. Breakfast mundane and repetitive.
6588,"My background - I travel 10 days per month all around the world. I have many hotel experiences BUT THIS IS THE WORST. Supposedly, I was getting a real good rate. The problem is that the room was very old and dated. Dark and dank. The carpet was so old I was honestly afraid to walk in my bare feet. Here is the worst part of my story ... I told my issues to Gerd Knaust and he had his assistant Penny call me. She proceeded to remind me I had the room at a discount rate. She said - ""What would you like us to do?"" to which I said - I am not going to beg you for anything nor will I argue - You do what is right. Again she reminded me I was getting a discounted rate already. I can tell you that the rooms are much nicer at Radison Blu, Marriott and several other properties in Shanghai.…"
6589,"Great location and immensely clean, this is a great hotel. The staff are so accommodating. 5 minute walk to Metro and a 20 minute walk to the Arc de Triompe and Champs des Lysee -- hope to be back soon "
6590,"Great location right next to the famous Kuddamm street and not far from the Zoo station which you can take train to any place in Berlin. Service was great ( special thanks to Mr  Sebastian and Ms. Jessica Aue at the front desk) We upgraded our room for a decent fee and it was worth it Our room was ready for our early check in and it is something we were grateful for. The only thing which was totally unacceptable was that one of the dining room staff insulted my wife for no reason ( my wife asked just for hot milk) and when informed one of the staff regarding that, the only thing she said was: "" we will speak to her"" ( she knew exactly who we are talking about - do not want to mention names at Tripadvisor) Last thing -as a manager at the hotel industry i wonder why the front desk…"
6591,"When I booked the room I noted that we were coming from the U.S. and would arrive EARLY in the am. Navigating from the airport to the hotel was really easy, I've been to Amsterdam before but if you're a first time visitor you will not have any issues finding the hotel. When we arrived at the hotel the guy looked at us as if were insane for asking to check in at 8 am. The room was clean and as described. It was really hot in Amsterdam and we had no AC (to be expected) but only one window opened a little bit. The bed was really comfortable and the hotel was quiet. When you stepped outside, though, it was like a flophouse. So many people hanging, where did they all come from?! The room has NO telephone in it so remember that when you need a taxi. We took a taxi into the main city…"
6592,We stayed at this hotel for a 2 week break in July . We have an ongoing complaint at the moment with Jet2  who are hopefully in conversation with the hotel . ( one blaming the other ) anyway I thought I would just write a bit about the hotel in general. . The staff are great. From the staff behind the desk to the maid they are all really friendly and helpful. The rooms were  clean but the bed could have done with changing more than once . We had 2 different rooms and the view from the second was better as the palm trees seemed to blocked the first room we had .  The pool area was clean apart from the German guy who would stub his cigarettes out by the side of the pool everyday and just leave them there . They could do with a few more umbrellas. We paid to go premium . Its cost a…
6593,"Terrible 3 day business stay.  I stayed in room 264 the room was nice enough maybe slightly dated with the popcorn ceilings and stand alone hvac unit.  There were what looked like pizza/spaghetti sauce stains on the curtains.  There shower head was also even with my chest and I am 5""11 so I had to squat to wash my face and head.  Whatever-  I can over come those things.  What I cannot over come is the outside coming into the room.  You could hear ever conversation, ever car, every bus, every intoxicsted person screaming, and anytime a car hit the grate outside it would sound like a shot went off on top of they if someone was smoking outside or a bus lingered outside long enough to smoke and exhaust would come into the room.  I should have known when ear plugs were left in the…"
6594,"Not sure where to start. Room was a 2 bed 2 bath listed a ""hip and historic"" decor.  It should have said ""tired and worn a2 star hotel decor"".  Room did not have a coffee pot. One bathroom had no hot water. The other had a stopped up drain in the shower. There was no room service menu.  There was a tablet that  was fully discharged which took an hour to get enough power to boot up.  I'm guessing that a room service might have been available there....but....the thing has both front and rear cameras on it.  HOW CREEPY IS THAT? CAMERAS CONNECTED TO THE HOTEL NETWORK IN THE ROOM. And the main restuarant appears to be an afterthought. It is crammed into several side rooms.  No ambiance and the food is mediocre at best.  I will not be returning ."
6595,"Room was lovely and clean, with a newly renovated bathroom.   Bed was comfy, we always had water and the staff at the hotel were lovely.  The location is brilliant - close to everything you could need.  I loved this hotel!  Can't wait to stay here again."
6596,The hotel was recommended to me by a friend who stayed there many years ago. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the hotel. I  enjoyed the hotel's facility and excellent service of the team. The location is ideal as it is close to the train station and many restaurants. I will stay there again.
6597,Decent hotel with nice restaurant - typical Holiday Inn really.  Had an issue with the breakfast not registering as being pre paid - not much of a problem but the rude staff however was an issue and didn't like me giving it back!!!  IF you are going to give me dirty looks while I have breakfast - believe me I am going to have something to say about it!!!  There is a free shuttle that takes you to the airport which is fine - if a bit slow.  Overall ok and would stay again
6598,The pics are a bit deceptive.  The actual sea view is a tunnel view between other buildings. Constrction noise next door means you can't stay in the room during the day for more than 5 minutes.  Location is good if you need to visit Nha Trang beach but I would give the place a miss.
6599,"The unbeatable location close to major points of Lisbon, just steps from great connections by bus and metro, Cais do Sodré. The charming, small and very cozy hotel has lift access to the upper floors. Each floor has a denomination; I was on the Fado's floor, where fado prints on the wall. A detail: no tubs in the rooms, so it's a litle a pitty just in suits rooms....Another thing that makes the hotel special: people working at reception are very helpful and welcoming, so thanks to Tiago Oliveira!"
6602,"The hotel is beautiful and the rooms truly come with many nice details such as TVs in the bathroom mirrors, lots of outlets in the rooms, lovely spa and pool area, etc. However, we did feel a bit nickel'ed and dime'd since breakfast is 38 euros and wifi is not free. Would probably stay somewhere else that included more for that amount of money."
6603,Location of the property is great and the building itself is very well done. Unfortunately the staff was disorganized and check in was terrible (took two hours to complete the process despite being told the room was ready). 
6604,Nice location to stay served by public transport good value the quality of the places room and parking avalable and silent places; very nice cooperation from the reception for the place and facility to visit Berlin.
6605,"To start off, the location from the airport is great. It was one stop off the train which was really handy. However we had to catch a train everyday to central Amsterdam. We didn't mind as we was able to see scenery on our journeys. Some places we had to jump on the train and the tram.   We arrived at Mercure hotel, sloterdijk station and overall it looked nice. The reception area was cosy. We spoke to the lady reception and was taken back by her attitude towards us.  When we arrived I had explained we made a mistake booking and that we booked a family room for two couples rather than two double rooms. I am very friendly and approachable and was very understanding when she told us there was nothing she could do. So we enquired about booking a room for that night and she firmly…"
6606,I stayed in h10 because of the high ranking  The hotel was excellent  The room was very nice despite the fact the the blankets were too small  Breakfast was with large variety and tasty  The atmosphere was also very nice The service of the front desk was absolutely great  I will definitely be back 
6607,"This hotel has two things going for it.  1 ) Great location  300 meters to the beach and 300 meters to a lake.  2) Next to a popular restaurant, in a safe part of the city.  However, the rooms need renovating, and the towels provided are stained and thin.  It is a greatly overrated 3 star establishment, and extremely poor value for money. The staff in the main try to be helpful, but are promoting a defective product."
6608,"Centrally located hotel with many attractions within walking distance. Alexanderplatz is about a 20 mins walk away. The bus stop and underground stops are also very close by. There's an Edeka supermarket round the corner. It was also easy to reach here with the airport shuttle bus with just one switch (on a weekday, not sure of weekend schedules) and the hotel is just across the road from the stop. There are some good restaurants for dinner which are a 5 mins walk away on the other side of the Spree. The hotel itself also has a restaurant and bar. The room and bathroom were good. There was also a kettle with tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Stayed here 5 nights. Good and efficient staff. Didn't have the breakfast so can't comment on it."
6609,"As always , wonderful , brings me back to my childhood in which I went with my family . Excelent service ... I hope next time they have update the TV and the plastic spoons for the coffee that Don’t match the hotel room , other than that , is one of my favorites hotels in the world .Timeless Chic Hotel "
6610,"It is well located in Kista, near Galleria (5 minutes walk). Not all the staff is welcoming, they do not clean your room everyday. The hotel concept is nice, the room I was in was very good, separate bedroom, living room with kitchenette . Breakfast is average."
6612,"Not really much else to say really. Staff need retraining: in my experience the hotel breakfast was the worst I've ever had. Food items mislabelled, bread burnt, and the coffee!!! The staff also had unpleasant attitudes. I saw one lady drop a fork (clean) on the ground, pick it up and then put it with a set :-0  My husband had a particularly awful time asking about how to get from Xian airport to our next Accor hotel (novotel). I observed the tail end of this conversation.  The room, had black scratch marks everywhere!!! This place is overdue a renovation."
6613,"In short don't stay here.  Long version,  The spa is not 5 star, its nice but the 30-35min (they claim 50) massage was average at best. You can book 2 day although they claim unlimited. In the end I skipped a couple of the bookings as it was not worth the time. Free rubbish is still just rubbish.   The food, well if your looking to eat in a pretentious french restaurant from the 90's you have found the right place. Again not 5 star food or quality just oversize plates from the 90's with what was clearly frozen seafood. Its a on a beach I cant believe they serve frozen seafood.   Apparently we had a ""fusionista"" some sort of private butler but given I did not even meet this person in the 4 days we stayed how can i rate that service as anything other then 0 out of 5.  On heading…"
6614,"We arrived around noon on Saturday, knowing we probably wouldn't be able to check in but we needed to check our bag in because we had plans with friends. At the desk, we were told our reservation didn't exist. I showed them the email confirmation that said otherwise and was told they would have it fixed in about 30 minutes. We decided to have a drink at the bar with our friends while they figure it out. 30 minutes later, no remedy. We needed to get going so we left our bag with the ambassador and were told the manager would be in contact with us later that day to confirm our room. We received a call a little after 6 p.m. that all was well and we would be able to check in when we arrived back to the hotel. Fast forward to about midnight. We arrived, checked in, and gave them our…"
6616,Lovely hotel with an underground station just opposite the entrance! The room was lovely with a great ensuite [no bath tub but a large shower which was fine for us]. The variety on offer for breakfast was excellent catering for all taste - our room rate incl. breakfast. Cannot comment on some of the hotel facilities like swimming pool or hotel restaurant as we choose not to use them but the hotel bar was relaxing
6618,The hotel location is very practical for business or local tourism. The rooms are fairly modern and with a fully equip kitchen. They have a nice selection of beauty products to try and the multilingual staff is very friendly.  Average Price: €100/night
6619,"Fly 1/4 way round the world only to arrive to LOUD jackhammers and demolition. Wanted us to pay $40 a night to be placed away from construction. Honestly, they should take $40 bucks off per night to stay. We would not spent our trip to Kauai this way if we'd known. Ice machine in our bldg is broke. Probably a decent place to stay next year or if you're hearing impaired. Room decor is nice. A/C cools well. But this construction noise is not what we expected. Ocean drowns it out so if you're tolerant stay but know going in or call ahead to find out progress of the project or stay on the ocean front. Why can't the resort run a huge special? At least one would know what to expect b/c it seems like we've been taken advantage of showing up to find this and not being informed."
6620,"Overall, you would be better off going to another property. I stayed here because it was the wedding hotel my friend booked but there have been far more cons than pros.   Cons: 1) the staff has been extremely unhelpful and not knowledgeable about simple things. I asked to leave a key at the front desk for my friend who was arriving at 2am and they said ""I'm not sure if it's going to work out for you"" (what does that even mean??) 2) they charged us $150 PER NIGHT in incidentals on top of a 60% pending deposit. That left us with over $600 of incidentals and $780 for a pending room charge for TWO NIGHTS and the employee made up some excuse as to why we had so many pending charges (the math did not add up since we were double charged for incidentals and she was rude). 3) no in room…"
6622," Restaurant service is definitely the worst there. Breakfast has a lot of items, but not that good quality, the whole bread is no 100% whole, cheese aren't brand new, there is no sandwich toaster.  I have bought a wine bottle in the supermarket to drink at my room. As I ordered in the room service a sandwich (that came to my room completely cold and I had to ask to heat it) plus 4 beers and also I asked for a corkscrew to open my wine. They said me that I should pay an almost USD 10 fee just to use the opener at my room !!!!!!!! It's an absurd, I have been in several different hotels in the world and in a wide range of price, I have never seen a hotel's restaurant charges a fee to offer a corkscrew !!!!!!! Besides it, as I complained about the price, the employee told me that, if I paid in cash, he could open it for the half of price (bribe). I said thanks, however I couldn't agree with that, I use to pay tip, not anything like this.  On the other hand the lobby's staff is efficient and kind.  If you don't want to deal with these situations, I highly not recommend this stay. …"
6623,"Nice and comfortable apartments with everything you need. Friendly staff, spacious and clean apartments, with all the things needed for an apartment hotel. Very positive experience and the prices are also at an equivalent level compared to the standard of the apartments. Close to the Hauptbahnhoff, not the most colorful area, but within af 15 minutes walking distance, you'll reach Brandenburger Tor and plenty of other sights."
6624,My fiance and I stayed here for 2 nights before our cruise.  Very helpful staff and nice rooms.  Location could not be better.  Walkable to so many of the sights!  Be aware that in booking on-line you could get an inside room with no windows to the outside.  Make sure you specify that you want a room facing Las Ramblas.  All rooms are sound proofed so you don't have to worry about the noise.
6625,"This hotel looks like it was an old, converted apartment building. Parking is tight and they charge you $20 per day. You have to leave the key with the front desk.  The air was stale and it smelled like mold/mildew. If you open an outside window it faces the street where the bus stop is.  The bedroom windows face the common interior hall, with lights on all night. The bed is very hard and uncomfortable.  The bathroom is uncomfortable, the shelf above the toilet prevents you from sitting comfortably. It is clean, and the staff was curteous but strict. I would not stay here again. "
6626,"Hotels in Paris are usually very very small. This Hotel is way above the average size in Paris. At the check-in you will be amazed with the kindness of receptionist always prompt to help you. Location is great, very close to metro station. Breakfast is complete."
6627,"Although the decor was lovely, we checked out within 20 minutes of arriving due to the overwhelming musty odor in the room. There were stains on the sofa in the room as well. We were charged nearly $300 for the night anyway."
6628,"Hostel fine (reasonably clean) but my stay was seriously let down by one particularly aggressive, unhelpful and rude female receptionist. Everything I asked or required seemed to be like asking her to travel to the moon. The management should pay more attention to this aspect of the experience - not just focusing on fancy new en suite rooms. Incidentally, my room was clearly new but there was quite a bit of builder's dust in many places. I wouldn't advise against staying there, but I'd like my comments to be picked up on by someone..."
6629,Our keys would never work to allow us entery to the building or our room.  We were constantly having to visit the office to have our keys re-programmed.  The patio doors to our room were left open after one cleaning - the odors that were allowed to fill the room because of this were not pleasant.  One of the towels left in the bathroom to dry yourself with had a hole in the middle with hair left on it.
6630,"Check-in at night was excellent (russian man) but check-out was terrible. The lady at the reception was not kind and was very rude. It was really a very disapontment in such a Hotel, and left a bad impression."
6631,"The front desk staff were extremely helpful, accommodating and friendly.  Everything about our quick visit was terrific.  Very comfortable bed, bedding and room decor appeared to be recently updated/renovated.  Loved that the window in our room actually opened. The evening breeze was lovely."
6632,"The front desk staff was very nice and tried to be helpful but most of their English was not great and I was given some misinformation regarding trains and if I didn't look in to it myself I likely would have been at the wrong train station. The spa was nice but one of the Jacuzzi options did not work and no one on staff even tested it for several days. One other Jacuzzi option they said worked but it did nothing. Some of the motion lights by the showers were also not working. The breakfast was good but the service was not. The eggs are very runny. I had dinner there only one time and for a simple order it got screwed up and took an extremely long time to get it. They did offer me a free glass of wine. After dinner, no one came with the check so I had to go to the bar to ask for…"
6633,"The hotel was beautiful, spotlessly clean, and quiet. The staff (who were all fluent in English) were exceptionally helpful and the breakfast was extraordinary. Dahlem is a little far out of Berlin, but the area is quiet, close to Freie Universität, and quite lovely. Head to the botanical garden, just around the corner."
6634,"My partner and I came here to view the room. It took staff 15 minutes to find the key, and they stated the price was 4,500,000 dong for the standard room ($190 USD per night). I feel I have to say, we were very polite and well-dressed, because we felt we were treated as if we were not welcome here.  The room was cute, but very average. Not much space in the room, very firm and uncomfortable bed, no gym, cheap and small looking bathroom, and standard pool for the Phu Quoc area. We stayed instead at Brenta Resort for 900,000 dong ($39 USD per night). It had a great pool and bar, nicer bathroom, and a good gym. I would advise looking instead at: -Brenta Resort -Coral Bay Resort  Both are equal or better in quality and 1/4 of the price. Edit: My partner and I did not choose to stay…"
6635,"My daughter & I stayed here in a twin room.  We basically only slept as tree are plenty of places nearby to get a lovely breakfast for a few euros. It was clean and tidy.  The room had a good shower, large towels, plenty toilet paper and basic toiletries.  There was only one electric socket useable in the room right above one of the beds so take a multi plug for charging more than one device. I also take a kettle & it was a bit dodgy have the lead hanging over my pillow whilst boiling water! Staff were helpful.  A taxi to the airport is about €12 and they will ring it for you. It is about a 15-20 minute walk downtown.  There is a metro but we liked the exercise.  Walking Lisbon is a great workout! The hotel is in the financial centre."
6636,"After a long day of work then travel, my wife and I headed to SF for a first time stay at the Adagio.  I knew we would be a late arrival so I checked in on my mobile app earlier in the day and notified them of our late arrival.  I even received an email late in the day from the duty manager in the early evening welcoming us and wanting to know if there was anything he could do.  Nice I thought.  Upon arrival, we are checked in and realizing that we are from Arizona the receptionist goes off on how bad the Cardinals football team is, and how her football team (won't mention) is better.  Odd I thought, great to be a fan, I'm one, but  no need to shove it in a guests face.  She went on to say as a elite member she upgraded our room.  Nice I thought again.  She briefly showed us the…"
6637,"Nice clean and quiet hotel with an amazing veggie/vegan breakfast bugget. Good location close to al lot of nice restaurants, cafes and shops. Its close to public transport and they rent good bikes as well"
6638,"The hotel was well situated and the staff friendly and helpful, however, we had no idea of the large amount of stairs  we had to negotiate to get to our room , not ideal for a lot of people. The room was clean and adequate but one night was enough , it almost felt like we were in an annex, silly little outside balcony with the AC unit on it , so , would not stay again unless allocated a better room ."
6639,The rooms were clean and the staff was very friendly and went out of their way to help us with any question or request. It is a bit out of the historic area which requires a 15 min subway ride to get down to the city center.  We liked being out in a neighborhood area.  There are many great places to eat near the hotel.
6640,Great hotel with many amenities and spacious rooms! The pool is small but will do the trick for you to enjoy a pampering evening. We had a family room which is two that connect! Overall everything was great!
6641,"My recent stay (5/25 - 5/27) at the Clifton Hotel - A Cambean Earth Hotel located at 1343 Collins Ave, Miami, FL, US, 33139 was DISASTROUS.   First, I would like to start off qualifying myself by saying that I do my best to take vacations often. I normally plan between three to five mini or extended vacations a year with family & friends. This means that choosing quality, reputable accommodations is extremely important to me.  Everything about the Clifton Hotel description (located on their website: http://www.cliftonsouthbeach.com/ and bookit.com: http://bookit.com/us/florida/miami/hotels/cliftonhotel/?cameFromVoucher=1) is a flat out lie. This hotel can easily be charged with false advertisement as well as misleading guests / customers. Below are just a few examples of their…"
6642,"I stayed 2 nights in the Studio Champagne. The bed is top quality and I slept very well. The kitchenette (good size sink & fridge, micro-wave, dishes, cutlery, glasses, washing liquid & clean sponge, etc.) was fully functional, no problems with it.  The independent control air conditioning was a major plus in summertime. As the other reviewers mentioned, the hotel is located on a square and is very quiet especially at night. For those who come by car, there are plenty public on-street parking spaces (not free though). The shower worked flawlessly, there were plenty clean towels put in a basket in the shower room.  Great value for the money, considering this is in a nice area of Paris.  I had a very good stay and would happily come back."
6643,"I have stayed at this hotel for many years and unfortunately it's not the same as it used to be. For a business hotel the wifi is horrible, slow and constantly cutting off. In this part of São Paulo there are not very many choices so I guess there is not as much need to do as much customer service."
6644,This hotel is small but well situated about ten minutes walk from most local facilities including the train and coaches to and from Nice airport.  A quaint hotel dating back to the 19th century it is staffed by really caring people who could not have been more helpful. Our room was cosy but clean and the lift up dates back nearly a hundred years but works perfectly and is a treasure to behold. Breakfast is continental but more than adequate and the free evening bar is very welcome. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend this hotel to any prospective visitors
6645,"Just completed a 3 night stay at the Esprit Saint-Germain. What a wonderful hotel. Our room on the 5th floor (which had a lovely, sunny  balcony) was beautifully clean and well appointed (plenty of storage space, a coffee machine and electric kettle, and even a tray of stationary, just in case you need the odd paper clip or two or flouresecent marker).   The staff were all very friendly and personable and went the extra step of ensuring everything was just right for us.  Small touches, like a lovely rose left in a vase in our room one evening, just added to the classiness.  Breakfast choice was terrific and ‘all hours’ access to complimentary drinks in either of two wonderfully comfortable lounges made our stay perfect.  Many thanks, Esprit St Germain team - we thoroughly…"
6646,"Our room was not cleaned all day despite requesting maid service several times during the day.  When we called the front desk to speak to a manager, we were told the manager was not available and that housekeeping was too busy to clean our room due to the hotel being busy.  In addition, the clerk had a terrible attitude.  This type of service (or lack of) is completely unacceptable for such a pricey hotel.  Never coming back and do not recommend.  There are plenty of other better hotels in the area. "
6647,I stayed with a bunch of women at hotel whitcomb last weekend for a bachelorette party. The hotel was a financial disaster. When we checked in the clerk told us that they weren't going to honor our price quoted from Expedia. There was a 100 difference from the quote we paid for to hold the rooms. We weren't in a situation to where we could look for another hotel because it was pride weekend and it was crazy packed everywhere. So we got stuck with paying 400 plus a night!  The hotel room itself had a crappy window unit ac and smelled old.  I wouldn't consider myself to be snobby about hotels I don't normally get to stay at nice places but for the price this one was awful.  Not to mention the hospitality. We were treated poorly and taken advantage of. There were constantly people…
6649,"This hotel is in a great location for the beach, so is fantastic when the weather is good, however would not recommend if you want to be within the hustle and bustle of the city centre. The hotel is situated right next to a petrol station, which is little bit of an eye sore. Also may have been responsible for the loud noises that kept awaking us around 3am - probably best to sleep with the window shut! We chose to walk everywhere, but there were plenty of bus stops nearby with regular services. There are lots of local restaurants nearby and a McDonalds a few minutes away in case you're after an easy tea.   We ordered a room-service pizza one night which was reasonable (if a little bit pricey). The breakfast buffet was ok, though didn't have a great amount of choice (a typical…"
6651,"Never go to San Fransisco during Sales Force annual conference. 170,000 visitors means you are forced to take a tiny little room like the one this hotel has. No fresh air and no light makes you fell like waking up in a coffin in the morning. Hot and stifling. Lucky it is close to everything so we could spend all our time in SF away from the hotel."
6652,"Having stayed here in its previous lifeform its truly amazing what a bit of TLC can do to a once former stalagluft concentration camp, The first thing that hits you is the walls have actually been plastered (Being in the same state dont take it for word) which takes away the fun of counting bricks whilst floating for better views after appreaciating the local vegetation, having been shut down for 15 months and having millions of euros spent you would have given a little more thought to aircon, yes air con not conair which is a six inch fan shared by all who have the will power to make it to the on button before melting, apart from this little overview ""A pat on the back"" for a 99% built hotel"
6653,"My friend, Karen, and I spent ten lovely days at the Adlon. When we travel, she lets me choose the hotel, and she arranges sites to visit while we're there.  The Brandenburg Gates just outside of the hotel are magnificent.  What a treasure it was! The hotel is beautifully appointed everywhere you look. Karen chose the breakfast everyday, and was that ever magnificent--I'm so glad she did. The breakfast buffet was exquisite. Everything a person could imagine or even dream of could be found on that buffet, including omelettes made to order. The serving staff at the hotel was as kind as they could possibly be, and excellent at what they do. The room was beautiful (see pictures below), and the room service daily was excellent. Each day when we returned from sightseeing, the room was as immaculate as when we moved in. The bath towels were on a warming rack so that every morning after stepping out of the shower, there was a warm bath towel with which to dry off. They also had two shower heads in the shower--a gigantic overhead one, and a smaller hand one which could be used by hand or positioned on the wall. For Christmas Day, they had a lovely Christmas day brunch. For New Year's Eve, they installed an ice sculpture of a bar in the lobby, as well as champagne and canapes. They decorated the lobby beautifully for the new year. After that, they offered a seven-course New Year's Eve dinner in the dining room. The wait staff was impeccable, and so lovely. When we got back to our room, they gave us both an Adlon white bath robe as well as a bottle of champagne, two glasses, and several snack items. One of my very favorite places was Adlon-To-Go, which was a small coffee shop connected to the hotel. Karen and I would have a delicious hot chocolate almost every day after our touring. The only disappointment was the concierge. They acted aloof and distracted and like they would prefer being somewhere else other than there helping us. But, other than the concierge, the hotel was lovely in every way. There were almost always taxies waiting outside every day.…"
6654,First we were put into the filthiest room of Everseen and we went back to the counter and told them that it wasn't acceptable and we need to be moved. They were extremely rude and said there were no rooms available and yet other people are leaving the hotel to go to a different hotel because they were having the same experience...so there were rooms. Unfortunately we had booked our trip through book-it.com and they would not give us a refund. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.
6655,"The hotel was very clean and the staff was friendly and caring.  I had a cold when i arrived in Santorini, so they asked the kitchen to cook me a chicken soup.  The room was ok, the bathroom is small. Taking a bath was a disaster, due to the plumbing system, the water leaked across the bathroom floor.  Our room didn't have a good view, and whilst there, it was really windy so it was quite noisy.  I didn't use much of the facilities as I was lying in bed most of the time.  If I get another chance to visit Santorini, I would stay here again."
6656,"Visited in December and pardon for the late review.This was one of the nicest hotels we stayed.I was apprehensive since ive heard the French are very snobbish and rude to non speaking French customers. But here all the staff speak English and smiling and polite.Even the cleaning lady or the staff in the kitchen were exceptionally polite and friendly.I felt at home , especially being a foreigner. The breakfast was very generous they have a breakfast buffet and it was really delicious and healthy.They literally had anything you could have wanted on a breakfast menu.The rooms were very clean bathrooms again clean and the reception lady was very nice and helpful when we ask for guide or suggestions.Also location is excellent since its walking distance to the metro.Not the mention…"
6658,"A fine hotel. Our spacious room 611 was as good as in many five star hotels. Sixth floor with great views of the sea and Funchal. Food fine, and staff almost all charming. But... I live in hill country and walk regularly so I didn't take the Tripadviser moaners too seriously. I was wrong -   it really is a very, very  steep hard hot and sweaty  walk up from the main road. It's a tough climb. Count two I'm afraid was the low key evening entertainment. Too low for me to actually be entertained. Instead went to the Hole in One pub at the bottom of the hill where the drinks were half the price and the entertainment rather better (enough drink and the trek back up the hill didn't seem quite exhausting). The hotel and staff are excellent and really deserve 4 stars but I can only give…"
6660,"We visited oia for 2 of our 5 nights on Santorini and chose to stay at Enalion. I’ve read a lot of great reviews about Simos, and although he did the basics of checking us in and storing our luggage until our room was ready, that’s about it. He didn’t give us a map or tell us anything about Santorini, and he didn’t explain whether we could get breakfast or anything. I read online it was 15€ per person, so we opted to eat out or got groceries. I was surprised how inattentive he was, because that was not our experience at other hotels around different islands in the Cyclades.  The rooms are quite cool in a cave. Right off the main center in Oia so you can walk to town. Furniture is a bit tired but the rooms are clean and acceptable.  Although the location was great, honestly, for the money, it wasn’t worth it. We went at the very end of high season (first week September) and the room rate was 272€ per night. With no breakfast included, it’s not worth it. You are much better off staying in one of the smaller towns away from Oia or Fira and coming for the day to Oia...the caldera views are cool, but unless you are in one of the true luxury hotels like Grace or Katiikies, don’t think it’s worth it.!Our last nights were in Megalachori which was just the cutest village!…"
6661,"Service, location, bfast are good. But can improve their rooms- clear bathroom shld not be for family, friends and should inform guests ahead of time. It can be so inconvenient to stay in a ""double couple room"" when the guests arent couple. We requested a deluxe room but we ended up with double room ddesigned for couple. Then we had to pay another euro30 per person for extra bed. Not good deal at all"
6662,"On july, I had stayed with my family for four days in this lovely hotel situated in a beautiful and quite neighbourhood, a half an hour from the center of Paris.Metro station is outside the hotel!It's also bicycle frienly. The rooms were clean, the service very good. The young receptionist was very polite and helpful at any question we had.Breakfast was very tasty and one young woman at the kitchen service was so sweet with a beautiful smile to welcome us every morning! I definitely recommend this hotel for relaxing vacation!"
6663,"Stayed 3 nights at the Pullman Berlin. The hotel is close to Kudamm and public transport. The breakfast was really good and available until 10h30 Mon-Fri and until 12 at the weekend. The staff was polite and professional, the room clean and the bed very cozy. Especially the pillows were really good. We enjoyed our stay at Pulman!"
6664,Rooms small and breakfast only one per room not per person . Breakfast to expensive add on parking all adds up could not walk out at night without people begging overall not good and hotel not up to Hyatt standards
6665,"We regretted choosing this hotel. There were positives - the pool was very large, there is direct access to a safe beach, towel service and cleanliness around the pool was good and transfer from airport was less than 10mins. The hotel's communal areas are pretty and well kept, spacious and inviting.  Sadly the rest of the hotel failed miserably. Corridors to rooms are dated and in need of renovations. Net curtains on windows are filthy.  Rooms are basic, cleans are hit and miss and room service terrible. Food and service at the hotel was VERY disappointing. Staff at the resort restaurant, Kukui's are so rude. Plain and simple.  Breakfast was basic and rushed, no eye contact - in and out appears to be the mantra. The front of house lady should not be in the service industry.…"
6666,"So, I forgot to post this when we originally returned home from our stay in June.   First, you will not be disappointed when you first arrive to the hotel. In a word ""stunning"".  We had planned this three day, two night trip in order to relax and unwind. Upon arrival, we were quickly taken to our room and felt we had selected the right location.  After unpacking, we headed to Jimmy's pub.  Ordered the tacos, only to learn they had run out of meat. Disappointing, but not a big deal. Ordered chips and salsa, and two beers.    For dinner we made reservations at the Oak Terrace. Food and service were exceptional. Unfortunately, people bring their unruly kids and let them run around like uncaged animals. Now, I would expect kids to be kids at Disneyland, Legoland or some other family…"
6667,"I have stayed probably 5 times at Steglitz International. The hotel itself is somewhat dated and looks like a refurbished communist-era building. Do not expect good views from the rooms. Having said that, the rooms are clean; the service is responsive; the breakfast buffet is quite good. There are multiple excellent shopping and eat-out options within walking distance. The bus, subway and U-bahn stations are right next to the hotel. I grew to like the area a lot!"
6668,"Came here on vacation in May and choose this hotel as we wanted something on the beach front in Ipanema. Actually, despite it satisfying that criteria the location was too great. It's kind of right in between Ipanema and Leblon so there's not much to do without a 10 minute walk, it is directly on the beach though which is cool.  The hotel is basic at best, basic breakfast, pretty small room (especially as we upgraded to a nicer one with a view). Most annoyingly though the noise from the road is so intense. I honestly thought I'd left a window open. The balcony doors were cheap and nasty and let all the noise through.   The pool area is big enough for around 4 people if you're lucky so is completely useless unless you get up mega early (which you probably would have to because…"
6669,"Very good location and nice zone, in front of Spittelmarkt U station, modern, delicious breakfast buffete, wi-fi working at 100% in all areas, very good service of all staff. Points of interest (walking distance): Checkpoint Charlie, Berliner Dom, Museumsinsel, Brandenburger Tor, Alexanderplatz and much more!"
6671,"this hotel is cool, very nice decoration and modern the rooms is confortable even though we were three inside the view from the bar 360 is really nice, very relaxing to enjoy a cool place outside the staff is helpful and give us good infos very nice location, easy to walk to La Rambla"
6672,"First and last time doing a park, sleep and fly here. If you are considering this hotel for the convenience of shuttle service to/from midway, I recommend to keep looking. We waited for almost an hour for a shuttle at 3:30 a.m, which made us late for boarding and had to call 3 times from the airport for a pickup. There must of been 40 people waiting for the shuttle at the airport all calling their own hotel from the midway hotel group, but it didn't matter. I would rate this a 0 if I could."
6673,Cosy hotel very comfortable bed.The staff very helpful.When we arrived our room wasn't ready so the manager gave us another room which he said was a better room.We was allowed to leave our cases on the last day as long as we wanted to then help ourselves to coffee on our return before going to the airport.
6674,"Don't stay here if you want to wander the local streets, eat out etc as you will be totally reliant on taxi/uber to go anywhere. Stayed 4 nights, weddings on 3 nights and very very noisy until early hours. Silver/red/black flock decor might be perfect for local wedding guests but not to everyone's taste. No international plugs in room, hairdryer cord very frayed and dangerous, daily newspaper arrived once, no tourist info in room - focus definitely on weddings/wedding guests and not tourists."
6676,"Modern, clean, quiet and relaxing hotel. We enjoyed our stay, and swimming pool was nice bonus. Location is perfect, walking distance to the zoo and to the bus stops. Hotel breakfast was also very good."
6678,"Our travel agent selected this hotel for us. Definitely a great location: just a 5-7 min walk from the royal palace, and about 3 minutes from Sergels Torg and the main visitors' information centre (which is a great info centre by the way). The hotel is new and the materials are really good quality. Very nicely designed. But very very dark. The hallways are dark and so was our room.  We had to use a flashlight to be able to see enough to operate the coffee maker in the cupboard).  We first were given a room that was at the end of 3 very long, dark hallways, and when we asked our travel agent about changing hotels, she checked with At Six and it turns out they had made a mistake and not given us the type of room we paid for. The staff were great about arranging a transfer to the…"
6679,"Was supposed to stay here for 2 nights but only stayed 1. We booked for a nonsmoking twin room, and even though they wrote back and CONFIRMED the twin room we were still put in double room 😑 When we asked for 2nd blanket, because as friends we wanted our own bedding, the receptionist didn't even understand why and what we are talking about -terrible English and not very helpful.  Also they had a music show at the bar and as our room was right below, it was very very loud!!! This is something they should say in their advertising that it is a party hotel or at least notify when there is a show that people know it will be too loud to listen to your things in your room even with headphones. I give 2 points, because style wise the room was ok and had a spacious and clean ensuite bathroom. But the bed was uncomfortable and as there are no windows or even wall at some places there were ants in the bed.…"
6680,Was travelling with family did payment with cash and they block my payment from credit card also I am international traveler and they said that it will be reverted back of my credit card but not yet refunded me and know says that u should be clear with your bank
6681,"A group of us stayed in 4 different rooms, which was an interesting exercise as we discovered how different the rooms can be. Mine was just perfect, but the twin room  was very strangely designed as the shower cubicle opened straight into the bedroom, as did the toilet, and the handbasins were actually in the bedroom. Not a great deal of privacy there! The beds were comfy, but the pillows rather too bulky and there didn't appear to be a menu to change them. Upon arrival, we were all offered a choice of 3 fragrances for our bathroom toiletries sets (shower gel, body lotion, shampoo and conditioner!) which was a lovely touch. The staff were very friendly and helpful. There is a lounge area with free refreshments (including Nespresso style coffee in the morning and wine in the…"
6682,"This hostel was extremely clean and modern, the beds were comfortable and the shower was the best I have ever had in a hostel. However the breakfast was basic and the hostel didn't organise any activities or encourage any social events so there was no interaction with other people in the hostel. This is usually my favourite part about staying in a hostel, meeting and spending time with new people. The staff were a little rude and were not helpful at all. I probably won't be returning to this hostel."
6683,"Between 2 metro stations, bus (did not try)  and 15min to pl.Catalunya ; we stayed in a 3 bdr appartment. It is much smaller than you would imagine from the pictures but has everything you need from kitchen utesils to scissors. The appartment was clean and renovated but the towels really need to be changed for newer ones, with no stains.. The staff at reception desk are nice and helpful. "
6684,"We stayed at The Galé Hotel Porto at the beginning of September. The location of the hotel is convenient and it is possible to walk to the city centre and the metro is at the corner. We payed for a superior room on the executive (17th) floor, but it turned out to be a standard normal size room. The room as well as the bathroom were clean, quiet and comfortable – the window can be opened. On the web site they advertise with privileged service, but apart from 3 apples and a bottle of water on the first night, there was no extra service at all.  Staff at the front desk seem to be busy, talking to each other and not attentive to their guests. They check you in and out, without saying so much as welcome or have a good trip home. Probably, because the hotel is big and buses with large…"
6685,"Perfect location at Rozenthaler Platz, nearby both tram and underground. Despite the central location and with the room next to the street, there were no disturbing noises. The breakfast was ok and internet did good. The room was small but well cleaned."
6686,"Upon checking in they informed me that my reservation was for the following week. I told them that I had obviously made a mistake but instead of changing the reservation they told me I would have to pay for next week as well. They have a poor attitude toward their clients and although this had been one of my favorite hotels I will not stay here again.  The rooms have apparently not been redone since I was last here several years ago. They smell musty, are Spartan in appearance, and are not dissimilar from a standard Holiday Inn room. In fact the Hyatt across the street has better rooms for less money and they do not smell like smoke.  This hotel, sadly, is not what it used to be. This is what a 400.00/night room really looks like; contrary to what's on the website."
6687,"A lovely hotel with spa facilities. The staff are friendly and always happy to help. You can not get into your room until 3pm. Which was fine as we left our bags at the hotel and went for lunch across the road.   I love this hotel and would go back again as it is in a great location, close to all the restaurants and shops.   Joon is the rooftop bar, this is €22 a cocktail. But you can sit on the beach across the road and still have a fabulous view for €12 a cocktail. "
6688,"We loved everything about this boutique hotel from its Belle Époque style to its sumptuous breakfasts. The rooms were quiet and tasteful, beds comfy.  Happy hour was a surprise with free drinks and nibbles a great place to start the evening.  The staff were attentive and ever helpful.  A perfect stay. "
6689,"I stayed for 4 nights at this Hyatt. I will say that the facilities are very nice and the hotel is obviously new. Overall the service is extremely lacking and it just seems like they can't quite put it all together.  The good: brand new facilities, nice fitness area/gym, large TV, nice room and bathroom. Free breakfast buffet was great.  The bad:  Service - the service is lacking in general. The process of getting a taxi at this hotel is miserable. I waited for 45 minutes on several occasions. The concierge desk would tell me a taxi was on the way, and after waiting for 20 minutes, I'd come back in and ask where the taxi was. They would then inform me that no taxi had ever accepted their ""call."" They never bothered to come tell me and didn't bother to come up with creative…"
6690,"The hotel is a 5 minute walk for the train station and it is easy to find your way around in Cannes with GPS  As we entered, we were greeted by a big smile on Oliver's face.  He promptly gave us the keys to our rooms even offered to help us carry our bags to the room which was on the 1st floor as there is no elevator. He suggested all the places in Cannes we could go to and good place close by where we could eat.  The rooms are not big but are comfortable and most important they are very clean. The toilets are also clean and are of decent size and don't make you feel cramped.  It is hardly a minutes walk to the famous Promenade des Anglais and the beach front. Everything is close by and walk able. There are ample bars, pubs, restaurants to hangs around the hotel and as for…"
6692,"Requested early check for 2pm which had been confirmed. Got there at 1:45 and had to wait until 4pm.  My child had to sleep in on the couch of the foyer.  Upon entering the room, I put my son to sleep and was immediately greeted with a phone call from the 1980's throw back telephone (instead of a knock at the front door) which woke my son up.  Five minutes later another phone call. I asked for no calls for 1 hour but apparently this wasn't communicated to the staff and they put Do Not Disturb for everything that night.  So, never received the complimentary smore's which had my kid crying after two hours of waiting.  Went to Conservatory for lunch/dinner and service was horrible. Food was amazing but son's food served cold.  Had to ask for them to been reheated so it was an hour…"
6693,"Small, family-run hotel in a great location in Cannes. My room was spacious (hard to find in this popular tourist city) and generally very comfortable. My only complaint was how soft the bed was (typical for Europe), and the fact that it was a bit slanted in one direction (which usually means the mattress needs to be turned). The staff at the hotel was excellent -- very cordial, spoke English, and made an effort to help me when asked. (I had a presentation I was working on, and was able to email it to the front desk to print it out several times over a 24-hour period.) The hotel is right behind the Majestic, so it's a very quick walk to the Palais if you're attending an event there. And the breakfast (for 15 Euros) was very nice, with a ham and cheese omlette, toast, fruit,…"
6694,"Rooms, Amenities were as expected, service at all locations was poor at best.  Couldn't believe the apathy and disinterest of the employee's.  The lack of service ruined what would have been a great experience otherwise."
6696,"Yes, there is the top terrace overlooking Copacabana beach. And then? Most rooms have the crapiest view, they are old and smelly, they are small and dark. Price is nonsense. Don't get trapped by the location on Copacabana, choose Ipanema beach! To be fair, breakfast is outstanding."
6697,"We stayed here after traveling back to Lisbon from Porto for half a night, until we had to leave for the airport at 3:30 am. The hotel is well located but has a very tired feel. Our room was much nicer, bathroom was more modern and it felt much cleaner at As Janeles Verdes, a sister hotel to Lisboa Plaza, and also in Lisbon. The staff here, however, were incredibly helpful and friendly and this made our short stay, much more enjoyable.  "
6698,"We chose this property due to its proximity to C2E2 2019, making our reservations immediately following C2E2 2018 directly with the hotel. Unfortunately we didn’t notice they reserved the wrong weekend. Throughout the year we called the property directly several times to confirm details of the reservation and the error went undetected. When we arrived to check in we were informed our reservation was for the following weekend. They did find us a room, talked us into a room upgrade and then double-charged us for it. Plus our room looked like it hadn’t been vacuumed for a week. At checkout when we asked if there was anything they could do to help us we were told they couldn’t do anything because “it was your fault. You got an email with the dates so we can’t help you.” I reminded…"
6699,"Stand by since this is my first day staying at the Sol Beach House Phu Quoc. I’ve never attempted such a review but given the amount of money this has cost me and based on my first day the issues with this place have nothing to do with the building or the environment and every thing to do with the management and what I suspect is a lack of investment in the quality of the training of the staff. First first impressions matter and in the hospitality industry where stressed people are spending hard earned cash to take a well earned rest, a service provider provides far more than a place to sleep and eat. You are creating an experience that when combined with the environment, creates a memorable experience where people feel welcome, nurtured and appreciated. On all three elements…"
6700,"I stayed here over the Thanksgiving break with my family.  I am Spire Elite Member.  It made no difference at this hotel.  Checking in, I ask for an upgrade since the hotel seemed 1/2 empty and I told them I was a Spire Elite member, I was told, no, and that this was a Kimpton Hotel.  I know what hotel I was checking into, I am guessing that it meant that my status meant nothing.  I went up to our room, our room was directly facing the other building - no views.  I am also Hilton Diamond Member.  My elite status with Hilton would get me so many benefits, but I guess this is Kimpton - whatever that means.  I went up to the swimming pool with my kids.  I notice other families has a balloon blow up balls to play with.  I inquired, and they told me they were given a package for…"
6701,"Lovely boutique hotel in the heart of Paris,  We had the Seine room right off the courtyard.  Just across the road from the Metro.  We also did the breakfasts every day which were great.  Pleasant staff, very helpful with arrangements and went above and beyond for us including the champagne in our room on our arrival (very late arrival,  not nice things in my head about EasyJet)  organizing taxis and recommendations.  But the best part was after.  I had left our memory cards to the camera in the safe and they answered my email and sent them to us.  They arrived yesterday.  Things like that warm my heart.    Would definitely stay here again and recommend it."
6702,"An all suite hotel in the heart of Berlin. Extremely stylish, modern .... spacious rooms and five star ambience.   Walk down to a lot of attractions and  almost  everything at hand.  Would love to stay there again."
6703,"Great location within walking distance of many historic sites and museums. Very friendly and professional staff. Rooms are very comfortable and spacious, I just wish that 1) more water was given 2) there was a coffee machine. Breakfast was reasonable too but I felt that staff were slightly tense when the restaurant got busy. And they over-cook the eggs"
6704,"Horrible property - old and run down.  Poor condition of beds, pillows and linen. Very noisey, can hear elevator run all night and no noise buffer to outside noise.  I’m a 25 year HH diamond traveler and amazed Hilton has name on this property.  Indicative of all Hilton’s decline into disrepair.  I’m focusing on SPG and Mariott - they hold their property owners to much better standards !"
6708,"This hotel is a small hotel with amazing location and great staffs. We booked the quadruple room. The bed was comfortable, layout of the rooms are functional and great for paris hotel. The hotel staffs are really friendly and willing to help. Overall we love staying in this hotel!"
6709,If you do not intend to sleep and like the smell of stale cigarette smoke then book this hotel right now. The room we were provided was on the 11th floor which provided good views of the city.  Despite being so high up we were still able to hear peoples conversations as they walked down the sidewalk from our room that combined with the hotel being situated next to a fire station we were unable to sleep. The room was spacious and had a good sized Kitchen but the hole room had a strong lingering smell of stale cigarette smoke. This hotel needs to work on insulating the rooms more efficiently from the noises generated from outside the hotel to allow its paying guests to rest successfully. The rooms (certainly the room I had) need to be redecorated to get rid of the overpowering…
6710,"It was a good stay, and a convenient location - however, the walls are thin and you can hear drunk and rowdy people in the neighbourhood till 3 or 4am, as it is a touristy area. Owner was helpful and gave travel tips."
6711,"Stayed a week for a family vacation with two deluxe rooms with terrace. We felt the staff were polite but not overly friendly and did not go out of their way to be helpful or offer any suggestions - we were clearly tourists and might have expected a warmer welcome. The breakfast was fine but the hot dishes were never hot - scrambled eggs, beans, bacon etc - all cold. We paid extra for a terrace and while it was large, it was like an enclosed back yard with no view of anything - we might not have booked this if we had realized there is no view at all. The room has a coffee maker but you have to pay for capsules.. and there was no kettle, and the hotel could not provide one - rather poor for a five star hotel. Even though it was possible to get hot water from the coffee machine,…"
6712,"Oranienburger Str is one of my favorite Berlin streets, so The Arcotel Velvet was a charming find of a boutique hotel. It is almost just on the corner of Freidrichsberger Str, so another convenient route.  The hotel was almost easy to miss, as it's sandwiched between a few nice cafes and graffiti wall. Service was friendly, and my room was clean and spacious. It faced interior, so it was extra quiet. Comfortable bed, too! My only comment on the room was that I wish they offered body lotion - the soap was very drying!  Breakfast was OK for 12euro - coffee, juice, rolls, meat and cheese, yogurt. If you want something more substantial or just an espresso - there are two cafe's right next door. Then, there are also lot's of other cafes, restaurants, markets - and even organic…"
6713,"The location is great, staff is very kind and helpful.Upon our early arrival we had been served by coffee and juice while the room was not yet ready.During our stay  we got everything perfectly, so we really enjoyed our staying by this hotel."
6714,"It is great location. Service is great except the house keeping, they are not professional. House keeping always making mistakes. The front desk are wander full especially Mr. Marcel who was always solving any problem very fast. The Resturant is good and not expensive. All who are in the restaurant were helpful and friendly. The room is small and has no minbar and very small dressing lockers, so it was hard for long stay. Total it is good to stay in but for long stay you will need to manage your room good."
6717,"We booked for 3 nights but ended up leaving a day early.   The rooms are nice and modern. Bathrooms large. Beds comfortable (and large) but are twins pushed together with separate sheets. Welcome to Europe!   The first night was a Sunday night. There was loud music coming from the street below. When 11pm came around, I called reception and they said it was only on weekends and only until 11:30pm. Somehow I felt this wasn't totally accurate. Music stopped at 12:05am.   The next night there was music until around 11pm but this was across the street at a restaurant.   The showers (maybe it was just ours?) are poorly designed so if your drain isn't 100 percent working, the water will flow into the rest of the bathroom. Both days we had to keep the water pressure at 50 percent as to…"
6718,"This is the old Embassy Suites that Diamond Properties bought and converted into timeshare properties. The rooms are renovated to include a mini-kitchen in the living area. It is in a great location in front of Kaanapali beach, service is okay and rooms are fairly comfortable. The rating is only 2 because of a few annoying issues. It takes forever to get common bathrooms to be cleaned. Most of the time, they smell like urine. I found toilet paper almost always out. Elevators take forever to come, especially when you're in the higher floors. Of course the employees are all out to accommodate you. They are trying their best so they could take you in for a sales presentation for their timeshare program. DO NOT BE TEMPTED TO ATTEND THE TIME SHARE PRESENTATION ! They promise you no…"
6720,we stayed at Village hotel in November and it was fairly quiet however at breakfast it seemed full and queues at popular times seemed to be handled poorly with the inside terrace (piano) area only being offered when we asked if we could use it as alternative. Staff in general were ok although some reception staff seemed fairly uninterested. Outside pool area was small and pool very cold even for time of year - inside pool was ok but Jacuzzi not working.
6721,"We stayed from 24th Feb for 1 week. When we checked in we were told we would have to change rooms next day. We assumed that in the morning we would be given our proper room particularly as the maid was at our old room to service it at 10 am for new occupants but no we had to wait until 3pm to be given our new room. This meant a lot of hanging about and not being able to unpack ,relax and rest. This was essential as my husband has Parkinsons and needs to sleep often in the day. We felt that we missed a day of our holiday which was important when you only stay for a week."
6722,"The hotel is spotless clean and very chic, situated 1 min walk from Pernety metro station line 13 and also in a walking distance from gare Montparnasse (and for beer lovers: there is an amazing beer shop closed to the hotel- 30 seconds walk).  Breakfast was amazing, option for everyone: baguettes, croissants, toast, 3 types of jams, honey, nutella,3-4 types of cheese, eggs, muesly, normal milk and soya milk, teas, coffees- options for everyone!Staff very friendly and helpful! There are a lot of nice restaurants in the area where you can experience parisian life style.""Au metro"" is a nice place just oposite metro station opened till late at night, quite a big place where you can always find a table good for a non sofistaced meal. L'Alexandra is a really nice place if you want…"
6723,"quite close to the main area and very close to the river spree if your after a mini cruise  plus the underground is nearby with lots of eating places,shops and historical sites all within walking distance if your quite fit . the staff are very nice and friendly and speak excellent english . Danke   Paul und Carole"
6724,"I have stayed at this hotel in the past and really enjoyed the visit, but my last stay was not up to previous visits.  I stayed on the executive level and the service and food were both terrible.  I had a business associate join me in the executive lounge for a meeting and throughout the course of our 45 minute meeting, dirty plates and glasses were left on all of the surrounding tables.  The next morning I got to breakfast a little late, and again the tables were all covered with dirty dishes and there was almost no food remaining.  When I walked into the room, the concierge was sure to verify that I was eligible for entrance.  When I asked about the dirty tables and lack of food, I was told that they would call the kitchen, but nothing happened.  Also, every almost every hotel…"
6725,Otherwise the hotel was fine - if you don't mind waiting for lifts when it's full and the ludicrously badly lit Redwood room. Rooms near the gym though are a nightmare - people in there crashing weights about from 6am that actually rattle the glasses And shake the floor.  Be warned!
6726,We were enchanted by pictures from booking.com. the rooms looked lovely and much bigger. turned out our room was small and not so nice. but still a place to sleep. The airport-pickup service was nice though. The stuff was also kind.
6727,"Location is everything while traveling and this hotel is right in the middle of everything. Walking distance to Las Ramblas, Plaza Cataluña and a metro just at the end of the street. Market and coffee shop right across the street a bonus. Taxis always outside, although you really don’t need them unless traveling late or to airport. The staff was very friendly and happy to assist with restaurant suggestions. They held our luggage as we checked in very early in the morning and even put them in our room for us. The room was comfortable and well appointed especially for Europe. The bathroom was a nice size with a larger shower than expected. Loved the large plush towels and robes. Only downside is we were on the first floor (2nd floor really) and you could hear noise from the…"
6728,"Clean, and great views over the Atlantic from the cliff top gardens. The rooms are very nice, spacious and some good touches in there. The pool area is pleasant. But it's difficult to say anything much more positive about the hotel and its atmosphere. It is a modern build, but in the style of big, thick, ugly office block type monolith, totally without character. If you spend your year in such an office block the last you want is to come on holiday to see the same. The staff are rather distant, doing their job, but no sparkle. The restaurant is very overpriced and serves food with no atmosphere - just standard international hotel fare, trying to pretend because they call it fusion food that it is somehow original. There are good restaurants in Lagos, but either you have to go on…"
6729,"Sadly I write this within an hour of checking in. A first for me. After 20+ yrs of visiting Chicago I decided to try the Drake Hotel.   This hotel has charm but not enough to make up for the needs of today's traveller.  Poor check-in. No package notice that arrived day before. In room none of the auto buttons on the phone work and no one answer pressing zero to at least get the operator. Had on speaker 4 times until the lines goes to a busy tone. No wifi in my room.  Room has an old smell. Can live with that.  Anyway, one night only. So far I do t think I'll check in again "
6730,"The hotel itself is rather good with nice rooms and very good brekfast, but IMPORTANT!! Chose a room on the rear side ! Rooms on the street side is very noisy due to heavy traffic on the Invalidenstrasse! Rather far from the real center of Berlin! But close to the subway!"
6731,Good location. Clean and very helpful staff. Surprisingly many good restaurants nearby (inexpensive). The staff spoke both Spanish and English and could help out with tickets for the FC Barcelona game a well.
6732,"First hotel I ever stayed which do not provide complimentary tea/coffee and you have to pay R10 for .5 l of hot water (Room do not provide hot water flask). Other than this, the hotel is in safe area and rooms was reasonable. Stay for 8 nights.  Would not recommended for future stay unless you get a excellent discount."
6733,"In keeping with most European hotels, the hotel room was quite compact, but lovely and open and modern. The shower was lovely, and the brightly coloured toilet paper an interesting touch. The breakfast restaurant was quaint and bright, and a good start to the day. A good venue in the heart of the city."
6734,I booked this hotel through trip adviser with a link to booking.com.  We had 3 rooms reserved for Saturday night.  One couple needed to cancel their room which we did on Friday morning through booking.com and the hotel.  I received a confirmation email from booking.com on Friday indicating that we still had two rooms confirmed for Saturday night.  When we showed up to check in at the Cambria we were told that we only had 1 room.  I tried to show them the confirmation from booking.com from Friday confirming 2 rooms and they wouldn’t even look at it.  They blamed it all on booking.com which doesn’t make any sense at all as I had an updated confirmation from booking.com that confirmed TWO rooms.  The first worker said. “Don’t worry—just call booking.com and have them push the…
6735,"Me and my girlfriend really enjoyed our stay here. Nice staff, clean and fresh rooms. Big and fresh bathroom. Close to subway lines. Felt like a safe area to be living in. Big plus for a refrigerator and a safe. Small room, but cosy, perfect for a couple of two."
6736,Hôtel in the middle of drug addicted people. Very unsafe. Window are so thin that you feel like sleeping in the street. Worst experience ever. When we asked to change rooms we were given sleeping pills !!! I hardly do not recommend this hotel.
6737,"we stayed for 3 nights, nice room and ok breakfast. the front desk staff was friendly and helpful. the CAUTION --when we checked out we had a ""0"" balance. when we got home and received our credit card bill we had a charge for 36 pesos, $7.12 usd. I sent 3 emails for clarification with no response.  WE WILL NOT STAY HERE ON OUR NEXT VISIT. the amount is small , the fraud is large."
6738,"Room very dated. It’s currently 5am and I can hear the noise from outside .... great. 😕 $39 for breakfast when there’s cheaper better places next door 😂 madness.  When checking in I heard the same lines from the desk “your room is not ready, for 40 we can upgrade you”. Really? Funny that when you say no suddenly a similar room is free.  Won’t come here again. "
6739,"Hotel centre Copacabana beach beach across main road swimming dangerous surf hotel guard on beach provides sun bed and parasol, staff and bars excellent, breakfast good, let down was sky restaurant food steak really tuff and not hot, dessert not exceptional for price, roof top pool on 30th floor small but heated, lifts being serviced time of visit so slow at meal times."
6740,Nice little hotel ideally located for local business meetings in Kista. My room was a decent size and perfectly adequate if quite basic. Receptionist very friendly and helpful.    Be aware some rooms do not have a window. I saw this on the website before booking and fortunately I was not in a windowless room but heard another customer complaining bitterly about this.   There is a gym on the first floor which looks a bit odd at first sight as it is in the middle of the corridor and surrounded by glass so you can see straight in. It is basically a large glass box with gym equipment in it.  There are also bedrooms situated on the same floor and alongside the dining area so in the morning I saw some guests literally open their room door and step out into the room where people were…
6742,"Came here with my partner from 04/01/19-08/01/19. We paid £212 for 4 nights and it was a good price considering it’s right next to the main station and close by to the historical sights and the zoos, we love the zoos! The drinks in the hotel were quite expensive but we didn’t drink much in the hotel, we frequented the Irish bar near checkpoint Charlie for drinks. All in all a great hotel in a brilliant location as a base for touring Berlin!"
6744,"Great facilities, great atmosphere and drink offers at Belushi's if you are staying at St. Christopher's! Receptionists will help you with anything you might need. The only disadvantage is the WiFi, which could work better."
6745,"Fine for local and close to office but very uninspiring all in all. Room felt dated, bathroom very basic, internet slow. Breakfast was good, selection wide and quality fine. I would stay in another hotel over this one but if pushed would stay here again."
6746,"I would not recommend this hotel to anyone traveling on business. This hotel would not accept our company's credit card authorization form and they did not notify me that there was still a billing issue until 4am when I checked out and had a flight to catch. I was disappointed with the lack of communication from the front desk staff. Other than that, my stay was fine. The décor in the hotel was nice and updated. It was clean. The breakfast selections were good. If you're staying on personal time, then I wouldn't imagine there would be the same billing issue that I experienced due to my traveling on business. "
6747,"We have an incredible 5 nights in hotel Chavanel the people at the front desk was super friendly and helpful , the rooms are little small but great size for Europe and the location is perfect just like 2 blocks from the champs élysées ,we walk everywhere also just crossing the street is the train station if you want to go farther like Versailles , if you walk to the champs élysées the red tour bus stop there and take you everywhere. The rooms were very comfortable and pretty we sleep really good. Is a place that we want to go back for sure!!!"
6748,"Spent a long wkend due to a national golf interclub competition. We booked 4 rooms, representing the San Isidro golf club. We had no hot water on 2 of the 4 days, this is a 5 star hotel!!.....the reply of the hotel staff was very poor saying that there was no commercial managers available and that no compensation of any kind was planned for the clients. We left with a VERY sour taste. "
6750,"This place gets impressive reviews because of location, location, location. Definitely not 5 star, but clean, basic and close to town, which is what you're paying for.  The beds are low, hard and there's no spa or fitness center.  The breakfast is buffet style with the basics-eggs, bacon, baked beans, corned flakes and coco puffs and canned fruit in syrup, plus a variety of breakfast breads, but no waffles, pancakes or anything out of the ordinary.  Let's just say that the pictures are a lot more impressive than the place itself.  They aren't deceptive-it just looks better in pictures."
6751,"I went to the hotel from Friday 17th July-Monday 20th July. It was exactly what we were looking for in a hotel. The staff were exceptionally friendly, the location is so quick and easy to get to all the attractions (louvre, Eiffel tower etc). We were so impressed with the rooms, they were spotlessly clean so much that it looked brand new. Very modern rooms, we also got room service, a flat screen TV, and fresh towels/ snacks & drinks were replaced daily. The cleaners did a fantastic job, our beds we're freshly made for when we got back and everything was back to it's original state once they had finished with it. I would say the one small down side was that the view wasn't all that nice however we did not mind this as we were out all day anyway so couldn't enjoy the views even…"
6752,"We checked in late around 9pm (shame on us) and the hotel only had ""double bed"" rooms, even though we explicitly booked king size bed.   Its a romantic getaway -- this time for a wedding -- and sleeping around 50-60 nights per year in hotels, we don't make this mistake when booking.  I don't pay $400 for double beds -- i would have rather stayed at an Econolodge with a king bed, but there was none nearby.  The night manager that evening was unable to accommodate us.   And made no effort to reduce the pain.   No offer of spa treatment, breakfast, comp room, nothing.   Not that I cared -- i wanted a king size bed -- but the gesture would have shown better training and customer service.   I asked for the general manager to call me but that never happened -- four days later -- i…"
6754,"This is not a bad hotel at all, but it is certainly expensive for what you get. We had a top floor room in the eaves which looked very nice on first glance but had a number of minor issues which were a disappointment. The aircon did not work very well at all and we were glad that it was October not August. The toilet had a minor fault which meant that we had to intervene to stop the cistern continually filling. The shower was adequate, nothing more. Main concern though was the bed and the pillows in particular. The mattress was very bouncy which meant that simply turning over woke my partner each time, but the pillows were really terrible, full of lumps and bumps and not worthy of a hotel of 4/5 star standard. The staff were fine and the free port appreciated but you can and…"
6755,"We had to make a last minute booking for this hotel and I find the hotel in the prime location, average quality and good enough for a short stay Location - 9/10 (right at the center of the city) Cleanliness - 8/10 Room quality - 7/10 Sleep quality - 7/10 Its a bit pricy"
6756,Room is so-so but the worst thing is they charge you for things normal hotel gives you for free and they try to make it hard to know if its free or you need to pay. Sample pic from their hotel room it was placed on top of fridge and there's also water with a different brand in the refrigerator. 
6757,"The AS 1829 Hotel has a very good location.  Very close to the Sao Bento Metro station. In an area where you have restaurants, bars, and walking distance from attractions and shopping.  The room that we stayed was small, however very clean with comfortable bed. The breakfast, included in our rate, was very good with a good variety of fruits, breads etc.  Great staff, pleasant and polite.  There is NO parking at the hotel and when you ""read Parking available"", means that is a public parking close by and the hotel has an arrangement with the Parking that you pay 23 Euros per day."
6758,"As a person that worked in Hotels for over fifteen years writing this review is more than difficult!  However, upcoming guests should read it and make sure they don’t experience the same situations my boyfriend and I experienced!  I would like to start by saying that the arrival process was flawless and the lady who checked us in was amazing and anticipated our needs!   We checked in Saturday Morning, the room was not ready (understandable), we booked the reservation through a third party (Online Travel agency).  My card was required for incidentals ($50.00 per night for 2 nights, a $100.00 Hold total).  Last night when I checked my bank account the Hotel charged me the incidentals for the second time and also a total amount of $245.02.  I called the Front Desk and spoke with…"
6759,"the rooms were very nice , not the largest that I have stayed in but also not the smallest. The room was clean and nicely appointed. The location was also close to a subway stop which made travel easy. The thing that we really liked was the breakfast spread they served. The staff was also very helpful giving advice as how to use the subway system to get to various places"
6760,The room was quite good but you must be very athletic to open or close the two big windows.. in fact you must climb on a chair or a table because handles are very high positioned (hopeing you'll not fall down and go the the hospital)!  Please I know that Lithuanian people is very tall but me poor italian 171 cm live on this earth too...  Breakfast was quite good.   The two young ladies at the reception were unwelcome when i asked please to put my little eyewash pocket (it's a medicine) for my eyes in the fridge of kitchen... in fact in the room YOU WILL NOT HAVE A FRIDGE (be aware of this information). Only if you book a superior room you will have (so they told me but please verify this information). when i booked the room didn't release about this so i had this problem. Staff…
6761,"The view was nice, great location to get to things but restaurant and tourists overlooked our suite. Position of room not very private. Bathroom essentials limited to non existent. Shampoo. And soap on a pump pack on the wall. Light bulbs were missing or not operating. We had to ask for the towels to be changed and they were not done till 5.00 pm that day. Had no idea of what the names of the staff were until the day we left. Breakfast was adequate. For the price that you pay you expect more. Take away the stunning view I would say the room itself would be no more than a 3 stars. The only thing that did stand out was the welcome we received from the gentleman who carried our bags to our room . We asked for extra pillows but we're told none were available."
6762,booked a room for mom there while she was visiting me in Berlin. it's not near the city highlights but its very central and public transport takes you everywhere within 15 minutes.  the room was nice and the staff was kind. 
6764,"This property really just pretends to be a hotel.  The beds are only half beds - lumpy hard mattresses on a low cheap wood platforms - no box spring and no real mattress.   The front desk confirmed that all beds in the ""hotel"" are the same.   Hyatt should be ashamed.  "
6765,"The location was fantastic only about a half dozen short blocks from the Eiffel  Tower. Quiet street with everything Parisien you could ask for within 1-2 blocks; boulangerie, crepes, sidewalk cafes, even terrific pizza. Cute rooms with a super helpful staff. Absolutely no issues at all!! Looking forward to our next stay there.....they checked all the boxes magnificently."
6766,"Lovely hotel in the heart of the mitte. Short distance to Unter den linden house and a 200. Bus ride to the philharmonic. A wonderful buffet breakfast but it is waaay understaffed,  one asks for coffee IF there is a server available. They need more. Busers (not pleasant to eat amongst tables full of soiled dishes) and more servers to take orders for anything (such as espresso drinks’) to make this the experience they obviouslymwish it to be.  Concierge very helpful plenty of elevators and area is charming."
6767,Check is is done by touch screen computer whilst being supervised... why give a computing lesson when you could have personal service from 'Mr Supervisor' . We didn't take up the offer of breakfast as it was 5star prices but didn't like up to 5star standards. Room was good wouldn't expect anything less for the price paid for it. 
6768,"Just want to share some experiences: The hotel location is quite good, room is very big, one of the front officers, a lady, is quite nice, nice view and great surroundings   However, some are negative reviews: 1. Hotel room was not properly cleaned, it was very dusty until I could see and when touching, can feel it was very dirty. You can check the pictures here. 2. Check in time was very slow, had to wait for 1.5 hours 3. The front officer, a guy, was very rude and not friendly when I asked when would I able to check-in.  I gave 4 stars is merely because I am Marriott Platinum number and I honored the Marriott hotels."
6769,"Some of the worst service I've ever experienced in Miami. Do not go here if you expect to be treated well. Left to go scout my own beach chairs (none of the vacant ones were stripped) and only received a towel after a 40 minute wait from the beach staff and that's cause I asked three times. Went to the pool thinking they were just short staffed (and after a talk with Elvis The manager) and the staff there didn't even bring me a towel or slip even though I waited in the same spot for an hour and a half. Don't leave your card at the bar! If they close they close without giving it back to you so you're left running around like a fool. Don't even get me started on the ""apologetic"" managers and the toilet that sounds like it's ready to explode when you flush it. Waste of my vacation…"
6770,"It's a lovely little hotel within walking distance of main attractions, but concierge absolutely ruined the experience. Concierge was trying to push this 2hour seminar(for buying timeshares). We told her (Julia) that we are not interested, we wanted to get some rest and then spend our time exploring the city. She would not take no for an answer. She called our room twice more that night even though we told het we were not interested. Next morning, we didn't get the friendly greeting, in fact, she acted as we weren't welcome any more. For that reason alone, we told all our friends to stay away from Wyndham and asked them to pass this to all the people they know. "
6771,"A great place with fantastic location, friendly staff and a clean apartment. Perfect to have a small kitchen in the studio apartment and the balcony was great for watching the city life all day long. With both the flower marked and the food marked across the street, we felt like we were in the perfect location for our vacation."
6772,"The Waldorf has been my favored hotel in Chicago since it opened but I don’t think I will be returning.  It is convenient to the shopping area of Michigan Avenue and family on the gold coast and I like it’s no tipping policy but it seems to have gone down hill. Problems started with our arrival.  I pulled into the charming courtyard and needed help to unload my luggage and seven year-old granddaughter.  Instead, while I was gathering her things, the bellman hopped into the drivers seat and said he was just going to move the car up. With my granddaughter unbuckled, several car doors open and me leaning into the car! No help unloading our suitcases however!  At check in the desk clerk kept insisting that we needed an accessible room.  We clearly didn’t.  Which is good because the…"
6773,"Stayed here Aug 2018 for two days.  I’ve been to this hotel maybe 20 times—always for work. Some wonderful public spaces w great style and history.   But here again with same old problems...we had a negotiated parking rate of $25 per day but garage was full and so only alternative was valet for $75/day!  Check-in staff were not pleasant—yelled at me for looking at them(moving slowly), when I never said a word—I was just looking at them because they were moving so slow. No consideration on parking bill when asked , though I know others got a comp discount. Our group had hundreds of rooms coming in, but nobody got negotiated rate we had negotiated due to garage being full.   Had a drink and bar staff were ok, but definitely union and working to drive tips. Went to room to watch TV…"
6774,We have stayed at many hotels in Chicag and decided to try something different.  We were in town for our daughters grad school graduation last weekend.  The hotel is nicely located.  Our room was on the 14th floor.  The second night of our stay I could hear the undertones and beat of music from the bar on the 16th floor until 3:00 am. If you stay here I would recommend requesting a room on a lower floor.
6776,"If you can help it, find a Hilton property. For starters, you have to pay $55 a day to park, which is more than some overnight parking garages in the area. I truly believe if you are a guest and patronizing the hotel, you should not be charged to park a car to do so.  After parking for $55, we realized the elevators were out of service due to construction and therefore the ONLY option was taking the stairs and there are signs stating to do so. This is definitely a lawsuit for those wheelchair bound or any other handicap preventing them from climbing up and down a cold stairwell.   Once we entered the building from 10 degree weather, we come to the front desk to check in. The check in experience should be like the opening act of a concert, it should build the momentum for the…"
6777,We were very happy to find this newly refurbished hotel. It is a little gem in a very nice area of town. Definitely to be recommended for people who want to stay in a lively part of town full of restaurants and plenty of things to see and do. The staff is very helpful as well!
6778,"Ibis berlinmitte s perfectly located a ten min walk from alexandra place, the starting point of many city tours It has a paid parking, it s near a petrol station with a minimarket that opens 24hrs. The hotel is clean, rooms are good sleep quality is very good"
6779,"Would easily give 4.5, but not an option. Only downside was very slow service in the bar (it was very few people there). Beautiful small and relaxing pool area. The upgraded room was perfect, with a balcony. Great view and nice reception staff :) "
6780,"For the price, it wasn't worth it. I have stayed other hotels for the same price with better bedding and atmosphere.  I was unable to sleep whole night as bedding was so bad and room temperature was bad even after adjusting."
6782,"I want to rate this definitely higher end hotel better, but the uncomfortable beds in the ""superior"" class rooms  caused us to loose sleep so I subtracted a star.  Otherwise had a helpful desk that made good recommendations and would call and reserve restaurants, nice baths with toiletries, clean upscale rooms, etc.  A bit far from the main tourist areas, but we ubered everywhere so did not bother us much, although I would probably stay near Rosso next time.  Near two subway stops but we did not use.  We visited in Nov so did not visit the pool.  Soundproofing good.  Somehow we managed to book the room without breakfast included, but was a huge buffet (they are also a restaurant)so we were kinda glad we didn't.  We did have the dinner buffet the first night as poring rain and…"
6783,"This was the WORST place we have EVER stayed,..and totally dissappointed for a Hilton Property,...NEVER be here EVER AGAIN!!! And the things they said they would rectify,...they did not,..worse place ever and staff to match that!!"
6784,"So the hotel in itself is beautiful. The staff are pleasant and approachable. When we were walking to our hotel room it seemed like the hallways would never end it looked like ""the shining"" with the red paint on the walls. It was cooler in some parts of the hallways than it was in our room. We laid on top of the covers the first night because it was so hot, absolutely no AC, we did have a fan and they brought another one for us when we asked and that did help make the next two nights much more comfortable. The mini fridge was complementary which was great because sometimes we would forget to stop by the store to get drinks and there would already be some in the fridge. Also had coffee and tea available in room and some peanuts. Also liked the robes and room slippers which was a…"
6785,"I stayed this hotel on a Contiki trip. Upon arriving and entering our room it was easily noticeable the smell of smoke and unfortunately lack of lighting. Our room was very basic with a run down old bathroom, extremely small vanity and no lighting. Our breakfast was very average and staff made us feel very unwelcomed. I felt very unsafe in the area due to the large amount of homeless people lingering outside.   Unfortunately upon leaving I left a couple of items behind after spending days trying to contact the House Keeping/Lost and Found was palmed off to the manager who lied about his dishonest staff. He questioned if I had misplaced the items somewhere else in my travels. Why would I would have bothered wasting my time contacting the hotel for over 5 days to find my items if…"
6786,"My partner and 1 year daughter loved our stay at La Bastide De L'Oliveraie.  The owner/lady who runs the hotel/reception certainly makes the hotel unique in terms of giving customers a personal touch, which you wouldn't get at big brand hotels.  The pool area was perfect for a morning prior to exploring the stunning area. The city of Cannes is only a 15 min walk which means the hotel is located in a lovely neighbourhood which feels safe.    We were lucky enough to stay during bastille day with the owner giving us excellent advice, on where to best view the firework display at the prom.   The hotel room was spotless and breakfast, exactly what you want.   5 star service in a unique family run boutique hotel."
6787,"the thing i liked the most about this hotel were the rooms. The rooms are not so big, but very modern with big windows. A big and good bed. Such a comfortable room.   Very good service at the reception and from the people working at the hotel. good location."
6788,"ok if you want really quiet the music at night was the same tunes by different people the folklore dancing was good , the food was cold even the soup wouldn't go there again. the beach had all the chairs locked up so you couldn't hire them the toilets were shut  the only thing good about this resort was the buse's out of there."
6789,"The staff - cleaning staff; wait staff are great.  The rooms are fine- nothing fantastic but nothing wrong.  Management is a nightmare.   I was overcharged on my bill and asked it to be fixed when I checked out.  Twice.  I was told it would be fixed.  I was charged the wrong amount on my credit card.   Four phone calls later (two to SPG and two to the hotel) my bill is still not correct.   And the best part is when the front desk manager told me I should be grateful for what I was charged as the room rate was less than I confirmed- which I pointed out to her was wrong as evidenced by the confirmation email I just sent her!  Given the many hotels in Chicago to choose from, this is not worth your time or money."
6792,"I have never stayed at such a cigarette smoke filled motel,such as this ,in my life. We opened the apartment door and were nearly knocked over by the wafting stench of cig smoke.This came as a mortifying betrayal of disapointment ,as we had specified strongly,  of a room for NON -SMOKING! It truly would not have been accepted had it not been for the fact that we arrived at 0230 after being held up at Pudong Airport. If you are a chronic smoker then this will save you from ever having to pay for them again, just suck it up,literally!  Welcome to China! "
6794,Modern clean comfortable hotel in alexanderplatz near to train station. Rooms a little on small side but ok.  Reception staff lovely... v helpful 👀.  Bfast staff a little less friendly but still ok/professional.   Bfast selection excellent.. good quality and fresh.  Bfast lounge quite busy @7.30am.  (Irish do appear early too you know and we like a continental bfast also) . Would recommend.  Be careful of the €2.50 crisps beside the complimentary water 😆..(non gratis).  Cleaniness paramount for me.. this didn’t disappoint.
6796,"First the Pros: The hotel has a very good location, only two blocks from Ipanema beach on a very high-class neighborhood, I felt secure walking late at night. Good restaurants near by at walking distance. The hotel provides you with towels and chairs at the beach. The staff is friendly and professional. The breakfast is very good with a good variety of fresh fruits, and regular continental breakfast buffet including scrambled eggs, ham and cheeses, decent. Nice view from the Pool on the top floor. Now the Cons: Please do not be full by the pictures. The hotel even though it has been refreshed (only some rooms), bed sheets were stained, and they had to be changed. The towels are old, and they cannot even dry you out. The worst part is the A/C I had to change rooms twice, the…"
6797,"We did not have a good experience. We booked a premium king room. Our room did not have a closet, the furniture were old and had scratches and marks everywhere. It did not feel clean. It looks like a cheap motel. The bed was very uncomfortable. The first day we had just one bath towel, when we asked for one more they told us they had a problem with the towels... we had to wait one day to have an extratowel. At thecheck outthey wanted to charge us an extra fee of U$ 25  per day. When we asked what that fee include, the receptionist said internet. I told her how dissapointed we were with our stay they did not charge us."
6798,"Wow, talk about poor decision making on the part of Morgan, the front desk manager.  Arrived at 11pm to find out the hotel was sold out and Morgan claims that she left a message.  Really? Showed her there were no calls to my cell phone, and I was on a plane, so how was I to even answer, and even if I could, is that even a justifiable excuse?  She offered to pay for us to relocate to their ghetto sister property and comp our stay but that's totally unacceptable for an SPG member...let alone someone with Lifetime Gold status.  Manager at the ghetto property sympathized with us and told us he chewed out the manager when she called for bumping a Gold member.   Furthermore, the cab driver that they hailed told us the real deal when we got into the cab, since he sees this all the…"
6799,We are lifetime Marriott Platinum members and when we arrived they told us that they had no available upgrades (hard to believe for a hotel this size that was not at capacity according to their website). Our first room was tiny and that bathroom wreaked of urine and was not very clean. We complained and let the staff know that they needed to clean it more thoroughly which they didn't do. Eventually they did accommodate our request for a better room and we were moved to a slightly larger room that seemed to be an upgrade but it still was not nice. The furniture and upholstery were worn and cracked. This place needs to be gutted. The staff needs to get their act together when it comes to service and upgrades for Platinum members...but I think this not just an issue at this…
6800,"So I just checked out of this hotel, actually a nice hotel with nice staff and a good restaurant..........but when I needed to check out a day earlier than I had booked I was informed by the very nice receptionist that the cut off point was 1400hrs, the time was 1408hrs. So I had missed the cut off by eight minutes, I suggested that out of good will perhaps they should reconsider charging me for the additional night as they could easily re sell the room but that was flatly refused, I asked to see the manager who moments ago had conferred with the receptionist on the charge but I was advised she was in a meeting and could not possibly discuss the subject with me. I expressed my displeasure politely and explained that I am a regular visitor to Miami on business so perhaps they…"
6801,"This hotel has many pluses - superb location, beautiful interiors, very friendly and helpful staff, big opulent rooms, looks quality, feels quality and is quality!  However the main thing that I want from any hotel is a good nights sleep and unfortunately the noise levels in the rooms means that this isn't going to happen.  We were given a room at the front on the square and we might as well have slept on the pavement - we could hear every noise - traffic, shouting from the street, singing from the late night drinking crowd - even though I loved the hotel I wouldn't stay here again for these reasons - I know this is probably a protected building but I'm sure interior double glazing could be put in the rooms to try to elevate some of the noise"
6802,"On March 5,2019 I stayed at the lovely Le Royal Hotel  in Paris. I traveled to this beautiful hotel with nine of my friends from Chicago. Le Royal is in a great location and there are plenty of restaurant's, shopping, and ATM machines all within walking distance. Le Royal offers a delicious breakfast with cheerful staff. The ladies at the front desk Leticia and Ann were so accommodating and gracious. We had an incident with lost baggage at the airport and Leticia was so helpful. She helped my friend navigate the Internet as well as the forms that were needed in order to retrieve her missing bag. She was kind enough to get my friend an Uber to the airport and help her navigate the Metro back to the hotel. Leticia also gave wonderful suggestions for various restaurant's,…"
6805,"So Paris has mostly done away with the “large” and branded hotels.  The result is many small boutique hotels.  This one is accessible to the Eiffel tower, but that’s about it.  Pros: -Amazing staff -Well priced -Clean  Cons: -Very weak air conditioning, unadjustable from the individual room -Noisy street -Elevator was tiny (1 person at a time) -Not too many food options close by  3 stars for hotel, 5 for service, hence the 4 rating."
6807,"Pool was closed, and the property didn't inform beforehand. Spoilt the one reason I booked the hotel.  Also the hotel charged my credit card and also took payment from me at the reception - ie double billing. Upon realizing, staff says its hotel practice and the company will return it. But this left me wasting much time having to call my oversea bank. "
6808,The Smartments are a very pleasant surprise. I felt like home every time I was there. I loved to have a place where to cook with all the appliances needed. It was very convenient to have several types of transport close to the smartments.
6809,"When we arrived the only thing the staff seemed to be interested in was trying to sell us tours and when we tried to explain that we were meeting up with friends they lost interest.  On being shown to our room the first thing we noticed was how small the double (apparently) bed was. We mentioned this and were told that was usual size for superior room, well it certainly doesn't look like that on their website. The whole place is in urgent need of refurbishment everything seems dated and maybe not as clean as it should be..  On returning at 11pm on the first night the hotel was in darkness, we managed to find an open door when we got inside there were several of the staff asleep on the floor. Not what we have experienced and any other hotel in Asia.  Bed was not comfortable and…"
6810,"I should have read the poor customer service reviews and avoided staying here.  Our poor experience started at check in where the one person working the desk let us stand there for 10 minutes before he acknowledged us (3pm on January 7) During this time, he was on the phone arguing with another customer and his manger about getting a box to someone at the airport.  Next, I tried calling the front desk on three separate  occasions and they never answered. The next morning my parents went down to try and find the included breakfast and asked several people who worked at the hotel and couldn't help them find it. Then. We came down to try and find coffee and the dispenser was out. Overall, it was pretty disappointing stay for 280$ a night and I would definitely never recommend it or…"
6811,"OK, this is a charming hotel with an inviting lobby, a good brasserie, and a staff that aims to please. It's location near the major museums was perfect for my spouse and me. However, our room was both small and poorly planned. We came with carry-on luggage, but the closet was small and had few hangers. There was not enough drawer space and NONE in the sleeping area. The lighting system was insane (all or nothing on two levels!).  The bathroom was on a different level from the bedroom and was lacking towel racks. We came for a week. We are members of Leading Hotels of the World and stayed in those hotels in London, Madrid, Budapest, and major US cities. Conservatorium ranks at the bottom of our list. Our room was not in the same league with real Leading Hotels."
6812,"tl,dr: avoid at all cost  we recently stayed at the joi de vivre hotel del solo  in san francisco. our plan was to stay for 5 nights, but some hours after check in we could not bare it any longer. we ran out of it as fast as we could. luckily our reservation was flexible. the hotel still charged us one night. at USD 250+ i was expecting a memorable experience, moreover because the brand is associated with hyatt. it is substantially below average; rating our stay as terrible is an understatement.   upon checking the staff told us we had been upgraded to a family room in the top floor near the elevator. we had several bags and he told us that we could walked right into from the elevator exit. that was not the case, there were some stairs to climb before arriving to the room.  the…"
6814,"First, let me say that the staff go above and beyond the call of duty and exceed all expectations but they are severely let down by a property that has not kept up with what you should expect in a property in this price bracket. Our biggest concern is that you should not expect to be woken up each morning at 0600 by what sounds like someone peeing right above your head, and then the roar of a flushing toilet ( it does sound like a jet blast). Facilities are fine and position is a plus. Just don't go here for peace and quiet!"
6815,"Just got back from visiting Paris, this hotel was lovely. It was clean, comfy, a lovely design and good location. Would recommend this hotel and if I returned to Paris I would stay at the hotel again. 😁"
6816,"Location is good but not super.Room was very big and comfortable and so was the bed,with a variety of pilows.Style is a matter of taste so i dont go to that.Breakfast was really boring.Every day the same poor options!!!Just scrambled eggs (not good at all)no other option of eggs on the buffet,no salmon,only one kind of ham.Small plates to serve yourself and small amounts presented in the buffet,obvious why.... Stuff was friendly but exept receptionists nobody knows a word in English so its difficult to ask for anything additional.If you stay for two days its ok,if more then you got a problem.In general, value for money doesnt have a balance.For the money you pay you should get much more in advance.And finally,dont know why and how, but the hotel was full of people 65 to 80?…"
6818,"I have been to Altis Grand for a two days conference that we organized at work. The selection of this hotel has been made by a local colleague of ours who surely knows better about Lisbon. Location is in the center of Lisbon in one of the fanciest areas and you can find two good restaurants nearby: Dotte and Guilty, as well as a coffee shop (chain) Padaria De Portuguesa. The hotel has a spa, a gym, few expensive shops near the reception, a fancy restaurant on the roof called Fernando and a nice lounge. The rooms are renovated yet very few are the ones with a view. The entire hotel is spacious yet needs renovation, it's pretty old. Breakfast was poor in terms of presentation, variety and quality not to mention the dim light and old furniture. Training rooms are also old even…"
6819,Well positioned for the beach and the train station. A bit of a walk to the old town though. Great service and standard. You even get Clarins meniatures in the bathroom. Breakfast is great but you need to pay extra for an omelette so when you paid for included is a bit of a let down. The only thing I'd improve on is perhaps having a deal with a beach provider offering deck chair discount to guests.
6820,"Welcome to Zoku—the love child of Legoland and Ikea!  If you’re a backpacking twenty-something millennial hipster into uber coolness where man-buns and affirmational tee shirts proliferate then this is totally your nirvana.  “Zoku Sweet Zoku” is the not-so-subtle reminder everywhere that you are encouraged to be a “neighbor” rather than a “guest.”  “We want you to feel at home!” assured the eager youngster at check-in.  But this “home” still has quite a few hiccups to overcome before it can be called truly comfortable.  So let’s start with location.  Yes, it is in Centrum and walkable to most things visitors find important.  But then most places in the city are pretty walkable given the compact nature of Amsterdam and its fine public transportation options.  What is…"
6821,"This hotel is near the Central Station of Amsterdam, and the situation is very good. You can choose trams, metro, boat or you just can walk to see sights. The breakfast also is good, and you wont be hungry after that.  But..the room! The room was dark and couldn't see properly at dusk. The lighting was indirect lighting and some of the fluorescent tubes completely went out. The beds' super-soft mattresses were on top of the soft, soft black mattress pads and when the sleeping position changed at night, the mattress slid to the floor. The toilet door could not be locked and the narrow window of the room gave direct access to the opposite shaft wall. Maybe a plus might mention a clean and bright bathroom and a big enough room."
6823,"Hotel was clean and breakfast OK. Privileged room was a bit stingy with the included minibar of limited use. The sign said ""enjoy without moderation"", but the fine print said limited use of some items and NO alcohol.... Poor form and disappointing.  The hotel is close to metro and regional train station for easy access to downtown and Sintra, but in a very dead are of town. Limited food options and even the train station is almost abandoned/derelict.   Parking expensive for a non-downtown location.  A bit noisey when other guests feel the need to party and wander the corridors.       "
6824,"Firstly there are several things everyone should know if they do not already before booking the Hotel or heading out there -  1. This is a cashless hotel, drinks, snacks and any added extras are totalled up and are to be paid at the end of your stay via card or cash. 2. The hotel is on a very large hill - bring comfortable shoes and be prepared to walk. 3. When you arrive at the airport, if you have transport sorted through your travel provider you hold luggage will be taken off you and placed in a van and taken to the hotel for you. 4. Both men and women are not allowed to wear shorts to dinner.  5. There is building work going on next door.  Now onto the review: When we arrived at the hotel we were warmly greeted by the guest manager and offered a glass of champagne while we…"
6825,"Outrigger Waikiki Beach has long been a fav when dropping into Hawaii and recently laid up for another 10 days there after mellowing out on the other islands for two weeks. But in the 6 months or so since last visiting the vibe has changed. That amazing Aloha hospitality was downbeat, the front desk folks were plastic tiki nice but tuned out; the housekeeping team were just functional, skimping on the coffee, down sized on the toiltries: hence the smaller than usual tip. On the upside the pool guys were great as usual and the poolside wait staff on point.  Don't get me wrong, it's still a great hotel; it just doesn't feel like the same hotel anymore. As for being a Discovery Club member, yet to reap the benefits!"
6826,"Your valet guys are atrocious.  Took me 20 mins to get my car, and once I finally did I was blocked by another guy for 5 mins while he loaded another guest's (7 women into a Honda Pilot) belongings into the car when there was plenty of space to pull to the side so I could move along.  Complete lack of common courtesy."
6827,Good location. Friendly staff. Clean bedroom. Good facilities. Everything you need for an enjoyable stay in Berlin. You just really need to change your pillows. Firm beds and soft pillows do not mix. Thank you! 
6828,"We booked online for this hotel. We paid cancellation free, which cut out within a few days of arrival. We checked the location on booking.com and saw it to be on the caldera side of the main road. On arrival, we found it was not so. We explained our mistake.. the manger was initially surprised but refunded one day of our stay when we decided to transfer to their sister hotel Secrets in oai proper at a cost of €1000 for 2 days. In summary, while cheaper and newer, this hotel has no view. It has delightful staff and excellent food. Just check the location carefully."
6829," Cleanliness - 5 Staff - 5 Location - 4 Other positives - very helpful reception team Other negatives - rooms are basic and our aircon unit was so loud we had a very poor night's sleep. They also play music on each floor very early in the morning  Value for money/Overall rating - 2, just update the rooms and you'd get more  Would I Stay Again? Not until the aircon units were updated "
6830,"Couples break in Lisbon, mid November.  This is a very modern and spacious hotel and our room was large, clean and modern. Would stay here again for a city break, but this is more of a business hotel. Overall it was a pleasurable stay!  Positives: Great gym and spa facilities  Tv and surround sound in room excellent Very comfy bed Electronic blinds and curtains in room Spacious bathroom Walking distance to Barrio Alto and other tourist destinations Close to Amoreiras shopping centre which has a great food court, good shopping and a 360 rooftop viewing experience of Lisbon which is worth doing if you stay at this hotel!  Great breakfast selection Free to use Nespresso coffee machine in our room which was fantastic Iron available in the room  Negatives: There was an issue in our…"
6831,"Good location, people were very welcoming but the rooms were dark. The breakfast offered a lot of choices but finally, nothing was actually good compared to the other 3* hotels I did in Vietnam. A real bad surprise at the end when I had to pay 16€ for my laundry which is almost the price of the room whereas the Viet people where I stayed in a guest house did it for less than 2€."
6832,"How can a hotel have a smoking room right next to the reception area and leave the doors wide open.  I agree with the last review it stinks at all times of the day. As you walk through the front door it hits you in the face and if you want to go on the computer you have to ensure the smell as that is just off the reception area.  I have never been to a hotel that allows this and surely it should be somewhere at the back not in view.  There is a non smoking room but it is right next to the smoking room with a curtain to separate the two.  I wish I had known this before booking I would never have come to this hotel.  Apart from the smoke at the stupid parrot that is allowed to fly around the breakfast/dining room it is a nice hotel, staff friendly but I would not recommend this…"
6833,"Stayed in this hostel for a few nights last week. Very large hostel with plenty of facilities, a social area, kitchen area, bar etc. Bathrooms were pretty basic and as expected for a budget hostel but rooms themselves were very spacious and clean. Would stay again if I ever returned to Berlin! "
6834,"Issues got fixed but our stay was impacted. i booked the room 1o months in advance. we got the room. during the first night we realised the zircon was not working. since the street is very noisy , we could not sleep. next day the zircon got fixed, but around 3 pm a very strong paint smell invaded the room. we opened the window, and around 6 we left for a stroll. came back the smell was still unbearable . so we had to go for dinner but we informed the reception. so at 10 pm coming back we started discussions about other rooms. we first were offered a room on the 6th floor, unrenovated . we refused so we were ""offered "" a suite but with 2 single beds .we had to repack and move. the next day we saw the hotel manager, we never got a clear explanation but at least we got the first…"
6835,"We chose this hotel because of its location which was excellent. There are a few U-bahn stations near the hotel so it's easy to explore the city from there. Even though our room was on the first floor and facing the street, we didn't hear any noice coming from the cars driving outside. Our room was spacious and modern and the toilet with glass walls was very cool. The bed was comfortable and we slept well every night. The only little complaint was the cleaning. They cleaned everything very well but we had problems with the locked toilet sink, not getting enough toiletpaper or showergel for two people and we had to ask few times from the reseption to fix those things. Despite of those little things our stay was pleasant and we can recommend this hotel."
6836,"Maybe I was just unlucky, but during a recent stay at the Grand Hyatt Sao Paulo I got a dirty room. I landed in GRU early in the morning and went straight to the Hotel, prepared to have  a quick shower and then start a Meeting. However, the assigned room had a dirty bathroom (especially shower) and no toilet tissues / paper available.  So I had to call the housekeeping to fix it. Took me half an hour and I didn't even receive an apology."
6837,"Booked room facing the square (don’t do it); it’s loud and noisy since it’s the main area for cars turning around. Not sure if they were sound proof windows; it did not help. After a few nights of lack of sleep, I checked out and moved to another hotel across the bridge.   Service was slow since it is a popular hotel. Had virtuoso rate but no upgrade provided. Might need to use IC cc for Upgrades. Check in was slow, room was not ready but they also forgot to text me when it was ready (an hour prior). Food was ok at the restaurant but not memorable. Concierge interactions and location(standing at desk in front) could be improved. The breakfast was better. Overall, would still recommend for first timers due to the location. Probably best during the slow months and choose the rooms…"
6838,We stayed in a deluxe room which was lovely - had a bath in the middle of the room which was ideal to soak in after the marathon!  With the bath and its sloping roof it was modern and quirky - although I did manage to bang my head on the ceiling accidentally so beware!  The room was quite as they are at the top of the hotel so there was no traffic noise.  The bed was comfy with an individual quilt arrangement that I had never seen before.  This worked well as it meant that neither of us could hog the quilt as we had our own.  Took a while for me to find where the hairdryer was after much searching it was under the bathroom sink attached to the wall. We were booked for bed and breakfast and the buffet breakfast was very good.  Lots of choice and the hot food was hot - often not…
6839,"Dirty exit vent on top of the restroom. I have a picture for it which I am going to upload on reviewer site. Its disgusting and I am surprised maid never bother to look at this.  Swimming is big deal for me. As soon as I jump in the indoor pool it was so cold I got back out in seconds. To warm myself up I went to take a shower and I couldn't find anywhere.  I called front desk and they said they will send somebody up here.  They had no idea shower wasnt working. After talking to Danny who is front desk manager, checked me in admitted he forgot to tell me that it's under renovation.  He told me I can go up to 15th floor to take shower.  I can easily go to my room and take shower instead right? There was no sign and even person who checked me in at the gym never said anything.  I…"
6841,"This hotel is basic and relatively cheap for Amsterdam.  I booked through eBookers and paid £340.86 for a twin room for 3 nights (August bank holiday weekend).  Breakfast is available to purchase for about EUR 18 per person, per day.  The location of the hotel is a short bus ride from the city centre, we did walk it a few times but it was a good 3-4km each way. If I visited Amsterdam again, I would stay closer to the heart of the city to be more in the hustle and bustle of things.  If you like to be in a quieter location, then this hotel is perfect.  Rooms were clean and basic and have do have a Nespresso machine and a fridge.  I’m not a fan of Nespresso so took a walk each morning to get coffee from elsewhere.  There weren’t many local places near to the hotel so I walked to…"
6842,"First trip to Paris and we were delighted to see the accommodations of this hotel.  We had 2 twin beds pushed together.  The room wash spacious and quiet.  The shower was a little small, but overall, not a problem.  We went in October and we had some warm days, so it was nice to have a little AC to cool off the room.  The breakfast was generous with fresh fruit, muffins, eggs, etc.  Water and soft drinks were in a mini fridge complimentary as well as snack from 2pm - 2am.  Great location. I would definate to stay again."
6843,"All was only fine. Nothing excellent. Location was good using public transport. Staff right but not friendly. Cleanliness was deficient. The worst was the noise during the night.  If you go there, please be sure you get a quiet room."
6844,"Nice hotel to stay in for a few days. Wish it had breakfast included, but was a good location for the locations we wanted to see. Had a little bit of trouble with our room (lock was broken) but it was fixed while we were out and the front desk was also able to ship out a package for us! Very friendly staff and overall a lovely stay"
6845,"The hotel is well located BUT the rooms are old, the carpet has mildew smell, the air-conditioning has a very bad noise and the thermostat is difficult to regulate. The bedding is also old and the TV is small. The bathroom is small and the hot water was almost non-existent in the sink ( but ok in the shower).  The complimentary breakfast was ok. The location is great and has a very nice view. If the hotel were renovated and brought to this century / decade, it could be a very nice hotel. It has a good backbone. Service was good but transportation is terrible. "
6846,"Staff are very friendly, but that's where the good stuff ends.  The room is bizzare, with its strange angles and garish design. Overall workmanship is very poor. Worst of all, there is no sound insulation - I was kept up till 2:30am thanks to music from another room.  For a business hotel, I'd prefer someplace else in BKC. "
6847,"Clean, quiet well run hostel. Helpful staff. Nice, do it yourself kitchen facilities and common room. No meals provided. Nearby transportation to all tourist sites. Garden with tables in the back. Not a party hostel."
6848,"I stayed here for 1 night on a recent visit to Berlin. The hotel is centrally located within easy reach of public transport and both Berlin airports.  Check was quick and efficient, despite arriving before lunchtime I was immediately given a room which was a welcome bonus.  The room was well appointed with large wardrobe space and decent size bathroom. The TV had a reasonable selection of channels in a variety of languages. My only minor complaint would be the air conditioning in the room wasn’t very effective. It could’ve just been the room I stayed it but it did get a bit stuffy. However, this wouldn’t put me off staying there again.  The breakfast was a buffet and had a large selection of hot and cold offerings and was worth the €15  Overall, a good city centre hotel with…"
6849,"Spent last week of March there.  Good location with walking distance to town, shops, restaurants etc.  Recommend not eating or drinking in hotel as it is very expensive and food not very good in our opinion.  Even walked out of Buffet Night after starter as couldn't find anything else on buffet that was halfway decent.  Restaurant Central in Canico only 10 minutes away will send car to pick up and drop off customers of 4 or more (excellent restaurant).   Found hotel clean and maid service good. Not much English TV.  Most staff professional and friendly, however asked young man at reception to mail postcards to UK and USA but none of them received??? Probably would not stay there again."
6850,I wouldn't hesitate for a minute recommending this hotel to my friends and family Kind regards Lars Tranæs Silkeborg Denmark ☺🇩🇰 Breakfast was one of the highlights of this Stay. Staff very aware of customers. 
6851,Enter Hotel Eiffel Blomet and just enjoy everything about this establishment. It’s in a terrific position close to the Hotel de Ville for this Arrondisement and has two little parks very close to the front door. Every member of staff looks after your every need and all this is provided at an excellent price. Room compact but well supplied with everything for a superb stay.
6853,"We hoped to enjoy 3 days, 2 nights at Astra suites for the Santorini portion of our Greece tour.   Due to ferry delays we didn't actual reach Astra until midnight, so we lost the first day.   The room was a large 1 bedroom suite, and they left snacks for is in the fridge, which was a great help for late arrivers after restaurants are closed.  They next day we got to enjoy amazing views, and delicious breakfast on the balcony of our suite.  The staff was very polite and helpful.  We spent the day walking Fira, and hoped to enjoy the resort on our last day, but that didn't work out.  The hotel refused to give us late check-out, and we had to put our bags in a storage room at 12.  They offered to allow us use of a hospitality suite after checkout.  As it turns out, the so called…"
6854,"Travelled to San Fran for a conference. This hotel was listed in the guide. Its proximity to the Convention center made it an attractive alternative. Their website pictures looked fine...   However from a room quality, this is the lowest quality room I have stayed in in 35 years. The cost, including taxes, was $418.04 USA dollars per night, which might reflect their short term ability to achieve a higher door rate during a large conference but certainly did not match the expectations we had regarding this cost point. The first two floors were redone and the rest of the hotel was simply rundown. Their sign in the lobby said ""We've have painstakingly preserved the few precious remnants' which means in reality we have never upgraded the rooms of this very old hotel. The bathrooms…"
6855,"As a loyal Hilton member, this is legit the WORST Hilton property I have ever stayed at. The hotel itself is fine but never have I experienced such terrible service!   We arrived early and our room was not ready - no problem, didn't expect it to be. I did however take issue when they stated they would safely store our luggage until the room was ready and I returned 3 hours later to find it sitting exactly where we had left it instead of in a locked room.   Upon getting to our room we found that there were only two towels. My husband called the front desk for more. After multiple calls to the front desk that went unanswered we finally reached them. Only problem being that they never brought any additional towels!  Left the hotel at 10AM to return at 5:30PM to a room that hadn't…"
6856,"Myself and my mum visited recently and had a lovely stay. Staff were very helpful and spoke great English. We arrived on a Thursday which was much less busier than when we left on the weekend. We were given the option of the ‘quieter side’ which was indeed very quiet compared the side on the main road. Room was 9/10 clean with a few smears missed in high places /walls. We stayed in a standard room which felt very modern and spacious. We ate at the hotel on one evening, the service was very quick and professional and food was great. Definitely felt like a 4 star hotel and would highly recommend to family and friends.  Also the hotel is right next to the U3 tube link which you can change onto the circle line that takes you into to the main city centre."
6857,The apartments are wonderful and Pascal is a great host. The apartments are always very clean and comfortable with a wonderful little garden.   We have used the apartments for conferences in CANNES for three years now and will continue to stay as its a perfect location.
6859,"I never ever write reviews (good or bad) for anything but I feel compelled to write negative reviews of The Raleigh on as many travel sites as I can.  I can honestly say that this was the worst hotel I've ever stayed in and would say that the room was comparable to a hostel.   Our room was HORRIBLE.  We paid for a king sized bed but received a full size bed instead and our room was legit in a stairwell.  There were concrete steps right outside our room that were extremely loud when people walked up and down them (which they did late into the night and early in the morning).  The bed did not have a mattress cover OR A FITTED SHEET.  There was just a very thin, itchy flat sheet laying on the bed between us and a bare mattress.  The flat sheet wasn't even tucked in so when you…"
6861,"Stayed 2 nights at this Hotel. Our group had 3 rooms. We stayed for 2 nights. Check in was quick. The nighttime bar staff as well as breakfast staff were very nice and service oriented. Breakfast buffet had a large variety. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Waking distance to Metro stations and had a few restaurant and bar options close by. We had a great short stay and would definitely return to this Hotel.   As an FYI ... they charge an occupancy tax when checking in. Not too much, $1.80 something per person."
6862,"We found the hotel on the internet and it received very good reviews.  We were hot disappointed.  The hotel is in a spectacular old townhouse just off the champs-elysees.  The room, while somewhat small, was very comfortable and the bed, linens and amenities were first class.  The service was tremendous.  It is clear that the entire staff is dedicated to helping the guests.  For the price, this is a real steal."
6863,"Very disappointed in my stay! I checked in early and was advised there would be a $25 early check in fee(plus taxes and other fees). Crazy! I’ve stayed at 5 star hotels across the country and have never had this kind of charge. I brought up the fee at check out and was really just ignored. For the price of my stay here, it wasn’t worth it. Also, this is a historic hotel which is code for beautifully restored Art Deco lobby, but shabby quest rooms. I had a tiny bathroom...hardly enough room to turn around.  "
6864,"One elevator down for repair, that's fine, things. Second elevator stopped half way between floors. No protocols in place Staff told my daughter and all eight on elevator to jump,the worst thing you can do as elevator can shift and de-capitation can follow. It's not if something goes wrong, it's what you do when it goes wrong. Management offer very shallow unprofessional response"
6865,"This hotel has the total wow factor and is impeccably clean. Breakfast, pizza bar and bar snacks were great. The staff are friendly and are desperately trying to provide a good service, however there is a total lack of them! The hotel seemed pretty full for the 5 days we were there, and the ratio of guests to staff was just totally disproportionate. Towards the end of our stay, after hearing a number of other guests complain about food taking too long, certain drinks not available, tables not cleared, I decided to speak to the duty manager. She was really very pleasant and I felt she took my concerns on board. There are some fantastic people working here, but they won’t stick around for long while they’re doing the work of 3 people. We thought it was maybe the wind down because…"
6866,"We liked this hotel very much indeed!  As it is classified to be a 2,5 stars hotel, we consider it marvellous.  It was very modern and clean and we also enjoyed their breakfast with fruits etc. Its location is very easy if you come from Tegel airport by bus  TXL or if you want to use busses number 100 or 200. "
6867,"The hotel is nicely situated. I have chosen to pay a bit more and have a nice river view (two rooms). Unfortunately no one has informed us about the construction work from 10.00 pm - 01.00 am, three hours of never ending drilling and heavy duty construction right in front of the main entrance door. No way one could think of sleeping.....but with kids you are certainly not going to party and hope for a good-night sleep. The hotel did not try to find a solution. They claimed to be fully booked, therefore no chance of changing rooms. They also came up with different answers how long the construction would last: once until midnight, once until 01.00 am, once ""they had no idea""....the governement. It seemed pretty normal for them for guests to pay and not to sleep. After refusing to…"
6868,"Staying here on business travel (business meetings held at hotel). My flight leaves today at 23 hrs but my meetings will finish after lunch. I went to the front desk to ask for checkout at 14 hrs instead of noon but they told me it was only possible if I pay an extra rate, so I had to leave my meetings for checking out at noon and avoid extra charges. My surprise was that when I returned to my meeting, most of the other participants had been allowed to check out later, even one of them at 20 hrs withouth any extra charge. I do not understand the criteria they use at front desk to determine who gets solved their requests and who does not."
6869,"The room doesn’t have amenities . When something is finished is not refilled,I.e coffee,ear sticks. We asked for slippers but we never took them. The breakfast is really very basic and the personnel is not very well organized. The hotel is not close to metro. It’s quite expensive for what it is."
6871,"This is a lovely little hotel in a convenient location. We had a standard double room which was small but practical, clean and comfortable bed. This hotel it’s just opposite a metro station and a 20 minute walk to the hotel. Nice shower with lovely toiletries, really friendly staff too. Thanks for having us Vic Eiffel, we will be back ❤️"
6872,"I have stayed here twice now, and enjoyed it. I chose premium rooms both times, and they included everything I needed. The staff were friendly and helpful but not intrusive. The breakfast was good - and the dinner was great. The schnitzel could not be bettered!"
6873,"Caveat: I don't know the hotels in Sao Paolo well, so it's possible this is good value for the price.   Pros: Indoor heated pool. Good location. Nice views from upper floors. There seemed to be an extensive spa massage menu but I didn't give it a try.   Cons: The rooms honestly feel a bit like a hostel. Average beds, dirty curtains, linoleum floors. All outlets are 110V. Hallways have dirty carpets, chipped paint, divots in some of the woodwork. Totally charmless.   Food: I ordered rice balls and pickled vegetables off the Japanese menu at the restaurant and they brought me a HUGE bowl of miso soup that was so salty it couldn't be eaten. The carpaccio wasn't great either. But the cappuccino was the best I had in Brazil.   Also, when we tried to order room service: No one could…"
6875,My wife and I booked this place because it was cheap and close to the airport and were blown away. The location was fantastic. Just head out the front door and turn right and you will find yourself trying to pick an amazing restaurant from a street and side streets lined with hundreds of choices. I would even consider coming back and staying her longer just to explore the neighborhoods surrounding it.
6876,"First of all, in terms of location and the view that this hotel rewards you, I think this place is top of the range. It also has multiple pools, each with slightly different views of the caldera. The view were mind-blowingly beautiful.   We stayed in room 20 for 3 nights and it might be the worst sleep I have had in decades (and I have stayed in hostels and on friends couches in my travels). The bed was a king sized bed the bottom support of which comprised of two single beds in transverse position. Why do they do that you might ask... Well it's because the bed frame on which these single beds lie is made from a thin square steel frame with ONE single bar through the middle. It's most definitely the cheapest bed frame I have ever seen. As a result the bed concaves in the middle…"
6877,"Room amazing, very comfortable and spacious and we had long windows on 3 sides, good shower. Quiet residential location but 10 minute walk to nearest metro or 20 minute taxi ride into the center which was ok but disruptive if you wanted to go back to the room during the day. Good spa although jacuzzi water lukewarm. Only food option is Michelin star abac restaurant, breakfast is €31 per head! Would go back but for a 5 star it has some glitches"
6878,"I had an individual room with a connecting doors between my room and next door.  The door had an 80mm gap below it which meant i could hear and see (!) everything from next door.  Not acceptable.  I phoned reception but there were no other rooms available they said within my room type.  Terrible experience, really awkward for myself and the people next door.  Really didn't enjoy it.  It's a fault with the building not the surroundings, it should be sorted, just lip the underside of the door.  Stupid, as otherwise it was ok."
6879,"We got a room with windows but they were inside the hotel! So no air at all for us just the air con! The continental breakfast was very poor, is not really a hotel that you can enjoy. Close to the city centre "
6880,I came for business a day early. This hotel is horrible.  Everything is way overpriced. It costs $25 for an umbrella at the beach and they wont let you open umbrellas at the pool because there is a slight breeze.  It takes 45 minutes to get food when you order it at the pool.    Stay away.  There are much better places to stay. 
6881,"Hotel is in a side road on a steep hillside.The road is quiet during the day but at night it becomes a ratrun connecting the lower and upper parts of Lisbon.The noise from traffic labouring up the hill is nonstop from about 8.00pm until 3-4.00am with an occasional noisy visit from the local waste collection service.The staff and the food is excellent .The furnishings in the rooms  have seen better days. The hotel also suffers from internal noise ,doors bang and loud conversations take place during the night."
6882,"Rooms: quite okay - comfortable beds, reasonable equipped Bathroom: old & not very clean breakfast: poor choice, coffee of bad quality, every single day the same regular things Swimmingpool: great, clean, nice surrounded by palm trees  Location: Bus stop in front of the ressort, the street is a bit noisy but that's the price you have to pay  for a good infrastructure, restaurants, bakerys, nice beach (caldera beach) around  We stayed 7 nights in august - we don't know whether other accomodations provide better value for money in high season but WE won't come back"
6883,"We came here for three days - 2 nights and we were truly disappointed. It all began with late check in and early check out. When you arrive early on the island and depart late, you're truly lost if you have to check in late and check out at dot 12. The arrival and departure date is lost by this policy. I would have appreciated it if they offered us a room to change our clothes or get a shower. With that policy we basically spent two days with our baggage in the car which was quit unconvienent. Also, the rooms were super tiny. The bathroom doesn't even fit one person, it was a joke. The AC was incredible loud, you can't sleep while it runs and you won't be able to open a full window as it's quite high so you will end up sleeping very warm. there's also no coffee maker or a…"
6884,"The location is just great, in the middle of everything People working there are nice, helpful and great I had only two things I did not like: The stairs are so steep but it is a historical building and they can not do it. I asked for a double bed and I got it but with 2 different mattresses, not so comfort  "
6885,"Given Grand Hyatt being a 5-star hotel, I am quite disappointed with my experience of staying at Grand Hyatt Shanghai from May 11 to 13 for the following reasons.  Lack of proper checking of amenities in room - the electronic weigher was not functioning properly when I tried using it and nobody checked and verified its functionality before a guest checked in.  I had to go down and inform the front desk to change another one.  The bathroom door was poorly maintained - the two bathroom doors could not be closed tightly and a gap remained so the light from the bathroom could escape and shed in the room through the gap even with the doors closed.  Lack of attention of the staff in the breakfast cafe on the 54th floor - while I was having breakfast, I left my table to get some…"
6886,Great hotel. Great location. Great staff. Great room. Very nice selection in Berlin. Hotel was opened in 2009 and still looks brand new. Free Wi-Fi worked great! Wonderful rocking chairs in the room in honor of John Kennedy's visit to Berlin in June 1963. I would definitely stay here again!
6887,I asked for a shot of Royale on the rocks and was handed a $16 bill. A shot? Really when the over priced honor bar in the room was $8.50. When a drink costs more than mid-town Manhatten you know it's a rip off!
6888,The rooms are dusty and dirty the ac didn’t work well and the bed was well used. The only plus was the employees they were all very nice. Unable to recommend to anyone I know.. foreigners beware of hotel name nothing like the pictures
6889,"I was with colleagues for the websummit conference and I have never seen staff so unhelpful and unwelcoming. Most of the time, they barely notice and acknowledge you, no good morning and asking them something seemed to bother them.  The hotel is nice but that’s pretty much it.  Lisbon has so many gems and nice places to stay in that it’s definitely not worth me coming back to this place.  I arrived 10 minutes earlier to breakfast one morning as I had a pick up at 7:45 am and the staff was cursing at me in portuguese. Bare in mind, I only wanted coffee."
6890,"Clean hotel, big room,  nice location near center and near metro station.  Also very close to sagrada famillia. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was ok.  Ideal for couples, friends and business trips. "
6891,"Very helpful staff, very clean, acceptable room size for Paris, close to Metro and Bus stations, many food places around, 15 min walk to Opera and shopping, good A/C in rooms, free drinks and coffee in the lobby."
6892,"My girlfriend and I booked a Legendary Suite- Ocean view. We arrived at midnight and they were out of ocean view suites, so they assigned us a suite overlooking a parking lot. After complaining, they moved us to a junior suite, which was a downgrade compared to the prepaid suite. I requested Eden Roc compensate us the for difference, but they refused to. I’m confused how they could downgrade the room and not compensate for the difference. Is that even legal?  I would avoid this hotel at all costs. "
6893,"A few months ago I stayed at the Novotel Shanghai Atlantis hotel.  My previous review gave it 4 out of 5 and mentioned that The Square Restaurant was said to be 24h.  Things have since changed unfortunately.    I stayed again at this hotel late September, and as my flight landed late, checked in and arrived at the restaurant close to 10pm.  The staff were closing the restaurant by then.  The manager graciously suggested to either deliver the food to my room (which they did) or accommodate me at the restaurant nonetheless.  Kudos to the staff for taking care of my needs, but I was under the impression that the restaurant was 24h according to my conversation with the staff during my last stay in June.  The Hainanese chicken rice was similar to last time - just about good enough…"
6894,"$461 per night before taxes?  For this cesspool?   This hotel's only redeeming quality is its location, which is superb.  The decor is pleasing to the eye and it thinly veils the filth underneath, best described as an elaborate illusion.   The bed in my room would not even be acceptable in a flop house.  One side of it is significantly lower than the other, probably a hangover from some obese guest that I can't stop imagining.  You hear and feel springs pop and recoil when you sit down.  I cannot imagine how I am going to get thru this stay.  Barely slept a wink last night in this misery. After not sleeping due to incredibly awful bed, I decided to start my day early in the ""fitness center"", a small, windowless closet on the 6th floor, so smelly and dirty it is impossible to…"
6895,"If you like luxury hotels and pleasant atmospheres, this hotel is not for you.  I travel all over the world and toggle between Marriott and Hilton’s and then use the points for vacations. I used all of my Hilton points for this spot and was horrified when I saw the room which was an upgrade to a terrace. The room was small and composed of concrete walls painted dark gray.  The lighting fixtures were factory like and did not help.  They were going for retro but achieved sad insane asylum. The service at the bars, restaurants and front desk was less than phenomenal.  All of the guests were sad and complaining about the service.  One night at the bar the bartender did not have wine glasses or a wine opener. The pool ran out of towels for more than two hours, but no worries because…"
6896,"This is one of the worst hotel experiences I have had, from start to finish. To begin with, the check in staff were unable to give me a room key because the system was down. Then the Concierge lost my luggage for two hours. At breakfast, I asked for a coffee which never arrived. The room was ok with a nice view, but dated and tired. On checkout, the staff were unable to finalise my bill because the credit card system was down. I stayed here as part of a conference deal, but if I had been a tourist paying my own money I would have been bitterly disappointed. "
6897,The Location of Park Inn by Radisson Alexanderplatz in the heart of Berlin is ideal for Seminars. The Conference room and the Service was very good. After work you can visit the Nicolai-Quarters and the Museum Island By foot!
6898,"Stay away from Wyndham! I have never been treated like this as a customer before.  I booked a suite for my family and myself 10 days before our intended stay, and Wyndham immediately charged my credit card for the room. However, upon our arrival at the hotel, I was told that they were overbooked and couldn't accommodate me. Booking.com was helpful and tried to find me another hotel, but when it comes to refund, the front desk manager at Wyndham Canterbury first denied that they ever charged me. When I showed her my bank charge record, she said she didn't know anything about it and I should directly contact the merchant who charged me - Wyndham Extra Holidays.   The weeks that followed was a total nightmare. I was bounced off between Wyndham Extra Holidays and Wyndham Canterbury,…"
6899,"Barcelona was our first destination in Spain. The place is on La Ramblas ! the busiest street in Barcelona ! the location is great ! close to the Metro but you can enjoy your walk along the street. The room is clean and neat but watch out for the extra charge on 'the cleaning service'. its 50 euro !!!! our room has a small balcony which we could see the street life. However, it's a bit noisy at night since people are partying really hard ! overall, it was a good stay which my friends and i enjoyed it !"
6901,"Everything was OK, modern style hotel, very testy breakfasts, the hotel is located near the city beach that comfortable for us while check in. Only one was unlikely moment for us - our booking was cancelled.  Only our persistence helped us to have the room in this hotel. Shortly is as follows: before coming the Barselona , I had communicated with the management of the hotel and received their confirmation about my reservation. On the receiption we have known that our booking is cancelled and the relevant letter was sent to my address. But I have not  received  this letter about cancellation and I had proved that no letter was received by me. When this printed letter was presented to us we looked that wrong address was indicated. Only this mistake of hotel administration helped…"
6903,"My girlfriend, my mother and I stayed here for three nights. The rooms (most of them, some are really tiny) are spacious and nice. Everything is from IKEA and it's quite minimalistic. The guesthouse is situated in an area with heavy traffic, and there is no a/c, so you have to choose between polluted air and noise or hot rooms...  The major drawback at this place is the breakfast, it just doesn't do it, cheap cheese and ham and bad rolls."
6904,"We stayed at this hotel between Christmas and New year.  The Christmas market outside the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church was within walking distance (or if you are feeling lazy you can get a bus from outside the hotel)  The room was clean and comfortable.  Breakfast in the top floor dining room was great.  Staff were very helpful  Bus to/ from the airport stops outside the hotel.    Places we visited - the Kaiser Wilhem memorial church and the new church next door  (lovely stained glass windows and also the drawing 'The Stalingrad Madonna'), the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag, Holocaust memorial and museum, the Topgraphy of terror (on site of Gestapo HQ), and the Olympic stadium"
6905,"In Budapest, only one NH hotel is located. your hotel in Berlin was my first experience. It was excellent, the food was fresh and good. The room, the beds are excellentyl hard.. The location si excellent, near to two metros."
6906,"Booked a double bed room however when I arrive they only had a single king room which wouldn't work for us.  They had no record of me requesting a double beds and refused to allow us to cancel the room without a fee.  Rogelio was very rude and called me a liar, and his GM supported his decision.   Luckily I was able to book the right room next door at the Hilton Gardens.  Hampton Inn only had one room in the entire place available and it was an extremely busy day with conventions and Copa America, they could have easily booked it with someone and now I have to go call Amex to dispute the $350 cancellation fee.  Stay away from this Hampton Inn, they are greedy and rude."
6907,"Well, the room was acceptable - the bed was fine and the room was new, at this newly built hotel, and clean. But the positives end there. •	The requested wake up call was never received - inexcusable at what is advertise as an airport hotel. •	And an airport over 30 minute taxi ride to the airport. That seems like a considerable distance to advertise oneself as an airport hotel. It would have been faster to stay close to the Maglev station and take the train!    Then the rest •	the room lighting was bad,  •	the hot water wasn't really hot, although it was eventually warm at least (A shower with full hot was colder than a normal shower), •	the check in process was lengthy and disorganised, even for the Mandarin speakers in the queue. For those of use that did not speak Mandarin…"
6910,"I stayed for a week with my partner and on arrival found the hotel to be very nice and presentable, it has a modern style and the rooms were very comfortable. During our stay we stayed in both a family room and double room (we were moved after a couple of days to a room with a sea view). Both were of a high standard, clean and comfortable. The shower was also very good.  The grounds were nice and the pool was always clean even if a bit cold at times. And the hotel is literally a 2 minute walk from the beach which is nice.   The shop in the hotel is useless unless you want over priced sun cream or rubbish props for the swimming pool and there are 2 bars if you include the pool bar and 3 restaurants if you include the pool bar again. Drinks are quite pricey, you can only get…"
6911,"I stayed at this hotel in November 2011 as part of a spa getaway with my Mom and cousin. I found the hotel to be quite nice - the rooms were comfortable...not the luxury you often find in an American hotel of this class, but very up to the more austere European standards. My mom and I shared a ""double"" room - which turned out to be identical in every way to my cousin's single room. As is typical in Europe, the bed is just two smaller beds pushed together. So we just pushed the two beds apart. We found all the staff to be friendly and helpful - including front desk, workout area and spa. I really loved the ""wellness"" area of the hotel. There is a great pool - kept at a nice temperature. And the sauna is awesome. Of course, it's co-ed and nude...so I expect many Americans will be…"
6913,"The whole experience was such a disappointment.  My husband and I were so excited for this weekend away in such a beautifully designed hotel, but the level of service was shocking.  When we pulled up with our car from the airport there were 4 gentleman chatting to each other and never assisted us with our awkward luggage, the doors, or even offered a simple ""hello"".  When we got to the front desk, the receptionist was too busy trying to up-charge us on a larger room instead of answering our questions about the hotel.  The library bar staff were always too busy to help us and ordering a meal or drink was almost impossible.  I had questions about the cocktail list, and his response was ""oh, I'm not familiar with our list or menu"", and never offered any additional help.  We ate in…"
6914,It was a good hotel with good food and great conferecerooms. Our room was nice and Clean. The location in the city center is a + . We will proabebly coming back eigther as a Group or individually. thanks for this time 
6915,"Upon entrance the hotel has a great infrastructure. The rooms are nice and spacious. The food was very basic. The location was not very appealing when exploring outide the hotel and going to different areas. Couldn't really find any suitable restaurants or food. McDonalds was around the corner, approximately 5-8 min walk which was nice to have but not everyday as its not very healthy. Overall it was an okay experience but wouldn't go to this particular area, Cascais is nicer which is an hour away by train from lisbon, it has a really nice beach which we visited during our stay."
6916,"My girlfriend and I were rudely treated during our stay at the hotel.   We were aggressively addressed by the security during NYE. The manager who I spoke with relating to the issue attempted to ""minimize"" our experience and merely say it was a ""misunderstanding."" When I didn't budge on his half-heartedly handling of the matter he offered a late check out and $50 credit deduction of the final bill.   The next day I called concierge for complimentary water and the same manager flat out refused me water. I personally had to call the reception and explain the situation.   Besides this, The Trump staff had a special knack for making my stay less than ideal. I'd rather send an enemy to the hotel for the onslaught of disappointments they'll encounter."
6917,"So , I stayed at this Hotel from the 5th of November till the 10th and away from their terrific location , they have a massive problem and sorry to say , some of the staff steal the guests items. While rushing to the airport on the 10th , I left my pair of jeans behind the bathroom door and on my way to catch my flight I remembered , so i called to ask them to keep it till my friend comes to pick it up. i have been transferred for almost 10 days to either answer machines , or useless employees. I left my number and no one got back to me , till two days ago I insisted to talk to someone of the house keeping. The lady got back to me saying that my stuff is ready for pick up and while revising the items , there was no jeans , only scissors and a magazine. I contacted their general…"
6918,"The aura of the hotel was that of friendliness. Extremely polite staff who were always there for me and my wife whenever we wanted a recommendation regarding restaurants,places to visit in Paris etc. Neddless to say that whenever we visit Paris from now on we will stay At Arvor Saint Georges. Our thanks for making our trip so much better."
6919,"We booked this hotel for a honeymoon trip and within an hour of checking in, we had left.  The hotel itself was modern and clean, however it is in a terrible location, surrounded by drug users and in an awful part of town that we felt unsafe walking to even in daylight. The first room we were put in was the size of a prison cell and had no natural light as it was in the middle of the building. We just about managed to fit into the room with 2 suitcases, let alone be able to open them and feel at home. We went down and complained and were put into a new room for an extra cost. In this room neither of the blinds worked and we overlooked a number of homeless persons’ tents and could see drug dealing openly outside (see photo). Again there was no space and you could hear everybody…"
6920,"Our stay here was a weekend to have a tour of Berlin. The hotel was very nice with welcoming reception staff and the bar although quiet was tended by very pleasant staff. The room was clean and had tea/coffee making facilities, toilet had a very good shower. We didn't use the restaurant so can't really give comment. The hotel is near to the metro which was handy for getting into Berlin city centre."
6921,"I was there for a business trip for 3 nights and I have to say the room was very clean. The bed was too soft for my taste and I am not a big fan of having 2 beds side by side instead of a large one. However I really appreciated being offered pillows with different levels of hardness/softness. The view from my room was absolutely ugly so I understand why the cleaning staff kept on closing the curtains.  The breakfast was very good but too crowded! The staff is very friendly and helpful!! Last but not least the hotel is very close to the metro station, about 20 minutes from the airport with the metro."
6922,"Let it be known that I have never written a review, though I felt compelled enough to share my dissatisfied experience. Long story short, we had two nights booked, then reduced it to one after just an hour in the hotel.  Firstly, the Executive Club was not worth the extra cost. The attendant made us feel as though we were doing something wrong by requiring us to fill out a ""guest voucher."" In my 25 years of traveling (business & pleasure) I never once had to ""explain"" who I was for complimentary h'orderves and soft drinks.  The staff had an expectation of gratuity when delivering an item (in this case a fan) to our room. I usually tip for everything, but when it feels expected, I don't.  The ""heavenly"" robes felt and looked as though they were ten years old.  The deluxe suite…"
6923,"I stayed at this hotel during a holiday, which was a mistake. Its location is good for business but is otherwise too far from the centre of the city. It is a nice property but the service is erratic and needs improvement. The food at the ground floor restaurant is superb. The reception staff are very charming, the Burmese doorman was incredibly helpful. The swimming pools are very nice too."
6924,"The staff was very pleasant and professional.  The upgrades to the Property are very nice.  The exterior and entrance are both attractive and appealing.  The lobby entrance, check-in desk and the fireplace seating area are nicely finished.  We were not as pleased with the actual room, however.  The room was dark and the lighting could be re-considered.  There was an annoying “buzzing” sound in the bathroom that was a constant.  Our best guess was that the source was a mechanical unit somewhere on the roof since we were in a second floor room.  The TV screen is small and the clarity lacking.  The cable did not offer premium channels (without commercials) and there were no movie options.  This is a key amenity that should be upgraded.  The microwave was old and well used.  It did…"
6925,"All staffs were helpful, sincere and kind. The gorgeous rooftop, directly facing the Sagrada Familiar, unbeatable location! We always have breakfast there! Room is simple but new (i like new everything!) my room is at the 1/F but directly facing the Sagrada Familiar. thanks for the arrangement and the gorgeous BIG rose :D we must stay here again if we’ll be back in the future (but do not raise too much room rate okay?! lol) They don’t provide toothpaste and toothbrush, you need to call and ask but they took long time to come, and only brought me ONE. We have two people obviously. Or the next day we ordered to exchange towel plus wanted toothpaste again, they intended to forget the toothpaste part, only towels came then..."
6927,"It is a nice place to stay in Cannes. It has good location, the apartments accomodate big groups of travelers. The host is nice and she was always there when we needed help or advice! Would definatelly recommend it!!!"
6928,"We stayed at this hotel for three days on a tourist visit to Shanghai. Our check-in experience was supremely average with disinterested, abrupt staff with poor english. Our room wasn't ready yet so we left our bags with the concierge who were equally as disinterested in providing any form of service. Upon entering the foyer, we walked past three unoccupied bell boys who watched us walk past with heavy bags towards the front desk. After reaching our room on the 21st floor, we were disgusted with the foul smell of the entire floor. Our room was fine but walking from the elevator to the room we realistically needed to hold our breath. We kept this room for the first night, despite the air conditioning not working, so we sweated through our first night. We decided to take breakfast…"
6929,"The only thing that is good about this place is the location, and the restaurants.  Customer service, horrible! Amenities, they charge for everything! This is more of a country club for rich snobs than it is a getaway vacation.  Everything about this resort is systematically designed to drain you of the money you spend on vacation.   - Want to sit in the steam room, they charge for it  - Room service $5 delivery charge  Are just a few of the examples. They advertise like you come here and you have all of these options as part of the stay, what they don't say, if they nickel and dime you for everything. There are way better placed you can go to spend your money."
6931,"Excellent aparthotel. We felt at home, kitchen was quality, with all one needed. The staff are very friendly and helpfull, a credit. My daughter and wife both said they would like to come back.   The transport link from Schonefeld airport   was good. Unusually you can travel straight from the airport on one train. S9 Schonefeld to Spandau, get off at Savignyplatz Sbahn and hotel is about 10 minutes walk.and over the kufurstendamm. Location excellent.   Love Berlin. Liked this hotel. "
6932,one time never again.the location at the coacabana is great. the hotel is very old a little bit renovatet the aiconditioning in the lobby ditnt work. the lobby dirty the bet in the room very old at the pool are 5 umbrellas 2 of them out of order the lounge chairs and cushions worn out 
6933,"After booking in to finish off our honeymoon in Vietnam, we looked forward to booking into this hotel after plenty of great reviews on trip advisor. It was a beuatiful hotel with great service most of the time, especially the honeymoon treatment which we appreciated. Visually Vinpearl lived up to all the photos posted. Except there was one MAJOR problem. Our room had curtains which would randomly open for no apparant reason. Being in a 5 * plus hotel meant to me not having to worry about anything and enjoying a fully catered for experience. Although at vinpearl I found myself waking almost every 2 hours to close the curtains. Finally I called for assistance at 2am and was told it must be the unit controlling the curtains, so I switched it off and pulled out the plug, which did…"
6934,Overall we enjoyed our stay but we were disappointed we had to pay 30 euros for early check in (3 hours) and we also thought studio overpriced at £273 for 3 nights. Would have been nice to have a comfy settee to relax instead of dining style chairs. Staff lovely and studio conveniently located a short 5 minute bus ride from city centre. 
6935,"Contemporary design, located right next to a tube station, friendly staff, excellent breakfast, spacious roof terrace adjacent to bar/restaurant, great shower - only down point, no tea/coffee facilities in single room."
6936,"I don't know where to start. The staff are friendly and helpful. The room was spacious and very clean. The breakfast was excellent - the tall male staff member could be quite rude, however all other staff were wonderful. The hotel was very close to the underground which makes for easy of travel through Berlin. I would happily stay at this hotel again, I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Thanks for making my stay pleasant. "
6937,Positives: Staff are nice and helpful Confortable room and silent Good location Good breakast Negatives:  Room service - awfull quality of the food Plastic botles in the rooms & at restaurant a low quality one although trying a nice concept of reusing and filtering water....but they choose one that make me sick Not quite top clean for a 5 star hotel
6938,"I spent here 10 days on a business trip. The hotel is modern, my room was equipped with tea/coffee making facilities and a small fridge/mini-bar. Although the room was not very spacious, it was cosy, with a very comfortable bed, a rocking chair and a working desk. There was a big bathtub in the bathroom, so I managed to relax after work:) Breakfasts are decent and various, wifi is fast and stable. I recommend this hotel."
6939,"Overall the hotel was great.  Shower and bath were great, bed really comfortable and service was good.  Breakfast was great too.  Only downside was when we asked about the spa and receptionist told us it’s nothing special so that put us off! "
6941,"Fantastic Hotel. Brilliant staff, nothing too much trouble. Great location and excellent value for money. I have stayed in the hotels on the Croisette and paid three times the amount and been badly let down. Will definitely return to the Renoir "
6943,"As most visitors state, this is located strangely for accommodation at the back of a vast atrium but once you get over that this is a fabulous location and the accommodation is incredibly spacious.  The kitchen is very well equipped with everything that you might need.  The fridge has a full mini bar but you can use it as we did for stuff we bought from the supermarket.  the only slight downside I'd say was the cost but then you are in central Berlin so it was no doubt competitive."
6944,"First thing you'll notice is terrible ""wunderbaum odour"" in the lobby. We had to run to the lifts everytime holding our breaths.  Standard room is quite small. In the bathroom the shower wall was leaking and the stone floor was very slippery when it was wet. The light switch cover was missing in the bathroom. You could see the wires. And that was in the bathroom which was very wet space.   They never refilled the minibar.  Breakfast was good and the hotel is very near the metro station and access to/from the airport is easy."
6945,"You'd think after paying this much for a room you would get some personalized service/comfort.  Not here.  The hotel has the feeling of an odd medieval castle, particularly one in which you were not a welcome guest.  From the lack of quick access to the room (it took a solid 5-10 minutes to get the room from hotel steps to door), inadequate breakfast benefits for elites and Fine Hotels & Resorts customers, to the lack of having a clothes steamer available, to waiting on hold for 10 minutes when simply calling room service and/or front desk from your room, to waiting nearly 2 hours for a room service order, to being overcharged a few hundred dollars after you've left, and finally the constant overcharging of ancillary services that were intended to be complimentary............I'd…"
6946,"Great hotel, magic staff. Very new and sophisticated. Good bar. But a long way out of town. Only 7-10 euro in a cab. Metro is 5-10 mins walk. They want 10 euro to use gym, a bit rich. This is all i have i say about this "
6947,"Stayed in this hotel on March 2014 just after the Carnaval in Salvador as we were in Rio. The whole experience was a bit disappointed. When we entered the room we noticed that it was not cleaned as there still had some used toiletries on the bathroom. We asked to change our room and it was done without any problem. The rooms are very dated, the lift and the carpet really need a good change. Overall not a very good stay. Wouldn't recommend unfortunate. The service was good actually to say the least. But it was about it."
6948,"Two things really bothered us on this trip.  1st and foremost, my partner and i were kicked out of the hotel bar because i was wearing a baseball cap. There was no dress code posted, and two other gentleman at the bar were wearing baseball caps as well. We were confused when security tapped us on the shoulder to remove us from the bar. This would have been our first drink there of the night, and the bartender was just as confused, even standing up for us mentioning the other patrons wearing hats. My partner cried for the rest of the night as we left for our hotel room. Crying on vacation sucks. Thanks Clift Hotel...  Second, the walls in our room were paper thin. We woke up to each of our neighbors phone alarms going off, and could hear one of the conference meetings or such…"
6949,I won't be staying here ever again .. not worth the money I spent plus I was charged for a night that I was not even IN Chicago. There was no shuttle from the airport.. not free internet... No breakfast offered ....
6950,"We went for a weekend with my boyfriend and the hotel was super nice, the staff from the reception were very helpful and gave us a lot of information about what to do in the city.  The breakfast is good, and the rooms are very comfortable!!!"
6951,We were checkin late at around 10:30pm and tired but the checkin staff was slow and not concentrated in serving us.   The building was old and dark everywhere. We were staying at the executive floor but it was not worth the stay. I'm sure there is another better hotel with similar range of price. Disappointed and sure it didn't live up to the Hilton's. 
6952,The hotel is fine just that room cleaning was done very late. Away from the busy area of Amsterdam and nice staff. Tram stop to Central station 5 min walk away and Museums 15 min walk away. Overall good value for money.  
6953,"I am a Marriott Rewards Platinum Premier Elite Member meaning that I stay at a LOT of hotels and am very loyal to the brand.  I recently booked an M Club Lounge room (highest category before a suite) at the Marriott Marquis in Chicago.  I was planning to stay for 6 nights.  Upon my arrival at the Elite check-in desk I was informed that I was being upgraded to a corner room category which I assumed was the next up room category, an Executive Suite.  When I arrived at my room it was the same room category that I had booked an paid for.  My ""corner"" room had windows on one wall only and looked exactly like the photos of the room category I had originally booked online.  Right after I got in my room I checked the hotel's room availability online and found an Executive suite being…"
6954,We often stay at Ibis hotels around Europe but this was a new one for us in Berlin and it was a positive surprise. Very fresh hotel with comfortable beds and larger bathrooms than usual. Good housekeeping and very friendly and helpful staff. Only 50-100 meters from the U-bahn station Wittenberg platz and 10-15 minutes walk from Bahnhof Zoologischer Garten. Not hard to find restaurants in this area and a lot of shops including KaDeWe close to the hotel. Recommended! 
6955,"I stayed here for 3 nights end of October and picked it purely because it was close to the venue of my meetings. It was the worst Ritz Carlton experience I have had. There is no one at the front door to help you; the food at the restaurant at the lobby is mediocre and the staff at the lobby bar do not care about you if you are not Chinese or ""white"". Room was decent. "
6956,"It was within walking distance of everything on our itinerary (Eiffel Tower, Canal Cruise, museums etc).  The room was comfortably set up for three people.  The bathroom is compact but has everything you need.  The hotel is very clean and charming.  "
6958,"We have always liked the great location and pleasant staff. Now that furnishings have been updated the ambiance is excellent. This location is an easy walk to shopping, and sites of interest. Breakfast room and meal are lovely."
6959,"This has to be the worst hotel I have stayed in. The heater was like something out of the Ark. Bathroom small and dingy and no safe. Staff on the other hand were brilliant, told us about catching the public bus instead of booking a tour which saved us loads of dollars. "
6960,"Never have we been in a hotel without hot water where they didn't offer some kind of an incentive for it.  We were there for 4 nights -,3 of the nights we had no hot water.   This shows a lack of respect for  the customer."
6961,"I stayed here recently for a work event and the hotel was very run down. The bathrooms were absolutely disgusting. There was no desk area to work at and the beds were not that comfortable. To some this may be seen as a ""Boutique"" hotel but to me this was just very run down and old."
6962,"The hotel should not advertise being pet friendly because they are not. There are other nicer hotels in SF that trully are pet friendly. The walls are pretty thin so if anyone hears a peep from your pet, there will likely be a cause of complaint. It wouldn’t have been too bad if the management was a little nicer speaking to us. But lessons learned in case you are a pet owner looking to stay here."
6963,I stayed for MWC event in Barcelona for 10 day's and seems it was good place and location . The view from the hotels you can see beech and mountain. The 8th floor of the hotel has swimming pool and can see the entire Panaromic view of the city. The location have some nice restaurants and local pubs .  Very pleased with staff at breakfast and we're very helpful and prompt.  
6964,"The location is central, but the hotel is like staying in a motel. The rooms are terribly small and stuffy, they have an old stench and the hotel is in dire need of renovation. We stayed here for a conference across the street and had to cancel our reservation and move to another hotel because it was that bad."
6965,"My wife and I stayed here for two nights while visiting Iguazu falls. Just a few minutes taxi ride to the twin center but off the beaten path enough that you feel nice and peaceful. The pros were that the hotel has a beautiful surrounding and the aesthetic of our room was good (although needed some work). The tub was dirty and the shower head covered with film. We also never received the bath robes that were missing from our room.  A big con was the quality of service. We are from the U.S. And we quickly  learned that some places in Argentina have a different idea of service, and we tried to adapt our standards accordingly. That being said, we had one of the worst experiences of our trip in the in hotel restaurant. We waited an eternity for a our order of linguine. The bread was…"
6966,"It is sad that non-white guests are continuously not welcomed at this Marriott affiliated hotel in Sao Paulo.  While white guests breeze thought the ""security"" is harrassing non-caucasian registered guests at the elevator and at the hotel entrance.  It is unfortunate that this is continuous issue at this hotel."
6967,"Stayed here for 3 nights in Jan. Very new scandi looking hotel. Staff really friendly, very clean and modern. They let us check in early which was really handy after an early morning flight from London. Love the location, handy to walk everywhere and lots of local bars and shops nearby. What wasn't great was the breakfast. There are a wide selection of foods on offer but they are all very refrigerated and tasteless. The staff did make us heated soya milk which was a nice touch, but too much empahsis on pastries and cakes - this day and age we want healthier options for breakfast and these were very limited. I survivied by taking my own tomatoes and avocado in - something I'd expect to be served in a supposedly 5* hotel. Good work on the rooms and service but you need to overhaul…"
6968,"The location of the hotel and staff politeness are the only good things about this hotel. The rooms i was presented on the fourth floor were smelly. Absolutely disgusting! It smelled like feces and sewage. I did not rest well at this hotel. I kept my clothes sealed in my luggage to avoid having the smell attach itself to my clothes. Staff did not seem surprised about the smell, offered two different rooms. One was loud (due to proximity of the street) and smelly, and the other was smelly. Avoid and save your money"
6969,"For a 5 star hotel I was very disappointed at the lack of staff in customer facing positions who could speak english. Service by porters, welcoming staff in the lobby was sub standard and you are basically left to do your own thing. Hotel do not have a drive way for taxi or other pickup and drop off so you have to negotiate the street traffic for a taxi. This is ok for normal travel but not if you have baggage with you. Superior bedroom with two beds was a bit dated/used but reasonable. Chinese restaurant experience was disappointing. Staff could not speak english and was overbearing. In the 1.5 hours we were in the restaurant from around 17:30 we were the only guests and 6 staff members milling around.  Food in all the hotel restaurants are average to good but very over priced.…"
6971,"This hotel is located in one of the nicest locations you will find, with astonishing surrounding. Our room was the ""only"" problem but understand it is one of a kind. Make sure you do not stay at the D. Dinis room, it is unconventional and not comfortable at all."
6972,"This hotel is in a good location with Checkpoint Charlie just around the corner and one of the Berlin Wall exhibitions about a 10 minute walk.  All tourist locations in the Mitte district are walkable. The hotel itself is very clean and comfortable with a good breakfast which is worth pre-paying for. The lobby and bar/restaurant area has a nice ambiance to it which brings me to a couple of negatives. Firstly food and drink in the hotel is quite pricey compared to local bars.  Secondly, one of the reception staff gave us some poor advice when wanting to book a trip up the TV tower, in the end we booked it online ourselves, if we had followed the advice given we would have turned up without a ticket and waited over an hour to enter."
6973,"Let me get this straight: my stay in general was great. The rooms are clean, the front desk staff was always helpful and friendly, and we had everything we needed for a place to stay for a few days. With that being said, if any discrepancies come up in which you feel you may need to talk to the manager (which I don't do often unless I think my reasoning is justified), good luck with receiving customer-oriented service. Be prepared to be told you are wrong. Also be prepared to be told that you as a customer can gladly choose to stay somewhere else. Whatever happened to the age-old saying that the ""customer is always right""? I don't know, but the manager has definitely never heard it. The website is not clear at all in certain aspects, and when we told him we felt we shouldn't be…"
6974,"Upon arrival, I was informed they did not have a room for me.  Instead, my family and I were sent off in a cab to another hotel down the street at 11 PM and then instructed to come back the next morning where they would have a room for us.  This would've been somewhat tolerable had they put us in a better hotel, but that was not the case.  Not only was this hotel not better than the Double Tree, but it was a several steps down in class.  The next opportunity to make things right would've been to put us in a suite.  This did not happen either.  The best they could offer for our troubles was sending a fruit and cheese plate to the room.  "
6975,My husband and I booked a weekend away for romance. We were on the first floor on the walking path. There was no division of privacy as people where walking up to our sliding glass door pearing in. It was very uncomfortable. The hotel has no bar. We were disappointed for the price we paid and to get what we got for it.
6976,"I stayed in this hotel on the job conference -- otherwise, I don't think I would stay there. I found it to be too expensive and not worth the money spent. The hotel is located in the old palace, although absolute majority of the rooms are located in the new building, to which there is a glass bridge. I personally like functional spaces and locations and this definitely was not one of them. Some people liking to stay in palaces would appreciate this experience much more. The hotel is located outside the center. I used the bus stop some 3-4 minutes walk to get to the center in slightly more than 30 minutes. This was OK, but could be much better in such a compact city as Lisbon. My major complaints are about the hotel itself: - the rooms are not particularly big (particularly when…"
6977,We were 2 senior couples travelling by car. Getting in and out of the area and parking the car was a real hassle wth crowded streets which were very narrow. The rooms are dark and noisy as rooms have thin walls and noises from other rooms travel. Rooms are dark and not comfortable. The hotel is very historic but for seniors it is a challenge. Service was excellent but the breakfasts were very average.  G and K from Oz
6978,"Hotel is Good located if you wish to stay near Lagos Marina. In my opinion what Algarve has to offer is to expensive for what you get. True the room are not bad everything else seem to lack of attention.  Cheep coffee machine, cheep tee and on top on that they don’t change tee or coffee on daily base!!? Sop in toilet cheep quality so everything else is. Hairdryer form First World War. Old Lobby with old furniture and also bar is low class.  On my opinion they need to low the price for 30-40% to be in range for what they offer. Little down the street on the right hotel same price but Sheraton for this one"
6979,"This is a little belated, but after a visit to the Kimpton Allegro the end of October for the Society for Neuroscience meeting, I would NOT recommend this hotel. My co-worker, SC, had her wallet stolen out of her purse, in the lobby, during the complimentary proseco happy hour. The manager, Todd, was incredibly rude, demeaning and dismissive about the incident. He really couldn't have cared less that SC was stuck, 600 miles away from home, without any money or identification. SC had a very clear timeline because of Uber receipts and credit card activity, making it only possible that the wallet was stolen in the lobby, in clear view of at least 3 security cameras. At first she was told the table where we were sitting was out of view of the cameras. Then she was told they could…"
6980,"This hotel is situated in a great location in the old part of the city. The staff were excellent in their friendliness, advice and level of service. The hotel itself was small, old a a little ""tired"". The room was small with no amenities as would normally be expected for a hotel in the price range. It also lacked any comfortable common areas to relax and mingle. The attached restaurant was very good and we highly recommend dining there."
6982,Internet very slow & they charge R$29 a day for it.  Not acceptable.  Bathroom small & only one small soap for 2 people.  Invited to cocktail party poolside. Sewer problem and hotel VERY slow to react & resolve.  Needs major renovation.  Not worth room rates being charged
6983,"Really nice hotel and lounge, it took over 20 minutes to even get the menu though. Swimming pool is cool. The prices are a bit expensive but regular for a 5 star hotel. The staff was friendly however. "
6984,"We stayed here for a week arriving back yesterday.  We had a pleasant stay at the hotel, the staff were very friendly and polite. However, I feel the rooms are in need of updating and a thorough clean.  The hotel advertises a Spa but this is at an additional charge of 10 Euros, I feel this should be included in the price paid and not at a further charge as the spa facilities are average.  The hotel is up a very steep hill so guests should be aware of this before booking if any mobility issues. The breakfast selection was excellent and pool snacks were delicious.  We had a lovely stay and would recommend but believe the rooms should be updated and cleaned thoroughly. "
6985,"Everyone on the staff was extremely courteous and happy to help attend to any of our needs.  Breakfast was well stocked and the rooms are clean and comfortable, with many amenities.  Sure to come back many times f=during our future visits to Paris."
6986,"This hotel is lovely, central position, the food is very good especially the BBQ and Gourmet nights. However it is only good if you have a sea view room, if you are put on the right hand side of the hotel you are in trouble as they overlook the public gardens, where there are many young homeless people sleeping rough, shouting all times of the  day  and night, urinating publicly, openly taking drugs and buying drugs which is not something you want to see when on holiday and therefore you can’t really use your balcony. Hotel reception not interested not even an apology at disturbed sleep every night , all they say is book sea view room, which you shouldn’t have to do and pay extra and don’t know about if it’s your first visit. So Beware. This will undoubtedly affect their tourism…"
6987,"My son and I have the best time in Berlin, close to train service and metro link. The room we were allocated was very large and it was very fresh looking, bright and cheery colours. The food was very nice, especially the Breakfast so colourful."
6988,"We spent two nights here in July in a Management suite. Excellent facilities - spacious, clean and comfortable. Reasonably equipped kitchenette.  Good bathroom - only slight criticism; the position of the shower it the middle of the bath made getting in and out a bit awkward- but not really a big issue.  The TV: many of the international channels did not work eg BBC world etc.. told reception- response not great- ""we will inform the cable company"" - that was it. Nothing happened, noo feedback ..just nothing.  Tried to get information on a tour .. reluctant explanation..   On the other hand very helpful with luggage, check in and check out- oh a curious thing at checking- we were early so the room was not ready - no problem and we were happy to wait - but were firmly told that we…"
6990,We booked for two nights in adamant suites Fira for 500 Euros/night including breakfast: 1- you cannot access the hotel by car you must walk we found Nikos waiting for us to carry the luggage very practical. 2-check in was very smooth and also Nikos very helpful and he offered us welcome wine drinks. 3-our emerals suite is nice superb view but need more blackout curtains not to wake up on sunrise. 4-breakfast must be reserved and you have to take what is left on the schedule since they serve it by time frame. 5-too many stairs and inclined road to reach the room so very tiresome not for people over 50. 6-on checkout if you have to leave luggages no pool or reception to stay till leaving. 7-housekeeping is very poor. 8-no visitors allowed. 9-guest relation Anna not pleasent or…
6991,"Beautiful hotel. Very well presented. Friendly staff. Excellent location to the city centre. Only downside was the room. Very odd layout. Would have been nice if it was designed a little differently to allow for a little privacy. The pillows were super soft and floppy which I hate. But all part and parcel of holiday stays! If you want to stay somewhere in a great location, this is the one for you."
6992,"Overpriced for the quality of rooms. The front desk staff and concierge were very helpful and pleasant and I would rate them highly. Our room was dated, the ceiling leaked leaving a slippery puddle on the tile by the minibar, which is disgusting and caused me to twist my ankle twice. The coffee wasn't replaced daily for the in room coffee maker and small things like that matter when you are paying $500 per night. The bathroom design is one of the worst I have seen ever. The shower floods the entire bathroom leaving a slippery wet floor in the entire room. Food in the restaurant is overpriced for the mediocre quality. We had to stand in the hallway by our room to pick up the wifi signal which was inconsistent and slow at best. Not worth the money."
6993,"We stayed at the Room Mate over bank holiday weekend and we feel the hotel is overpriced for what you get. We paid £220 per night room only  for an upgraded room on 12th floor with ' lovely views' , the view was of the road and the flats across the street so not a lovely view in our opinion . The area  the hotel is located in is lovely and quiet approx. 15 mins walk into the main area. The hotel is clean and comfortable but nothing special . We tried to book a table in the hotel restaurant on the Saturday evening but we were advised it was fully booked . The restaurant is not part of the hotel but if you have rooms book there should always be availability to eat in the hotel restaurant for residents. We didn't have breakfast in the hotel so cannot comment , we though at £16 per…"
6994,"I rarely stay at the same place twice, with Hotel de la Porte Doree being the exception. This was our third visit, and first with baby. Communication via e-mail was quick. Staff are friendly and efficient. We ended up in an executive double and found the room nicely decorated, large, spacious, and with a tub. They had a play pen, toys, and books ready in the room when we checked-in. There is a bottle of sparkling and flat left in the room daily. We had breakfast at the hotel on this trip and found good value as there were cheese, meats, fruit, juices, coffee, breads, and quiche....in a buffet setting. We still love the neighbourhood, but found the near by park a little worn down and in need of attention by the city. When taking transit to the local sites we liked to take line 6…"
6995,"I choose this hotel only for the position close to my business and this is the only Starwood hotel in this district. The hotel is old the room must be refreshed and need to be updated. The bathroom is without shower , the shower is the small bath with plastic curtain, terrible. The swimming pool seems not clean and very small I suppose 5 meters... The clubfloor is ok but the food not so nice."
6996,"Location on the river is great as you are in front boat launch for thousands of tourists so only meters to walk and you are in the heart of the tourist zone.  The staff was very good, friendly and very accommodating.  We booked a river view room which was a premium selection.  Big negative was the room was the size of a matchbox and the river view view was fro tiny windows 5 feet off the ground so you had to actually by them to see anything.  Better value elsewhere. Other draw back is breakfast doesn’t start until 7:30 which is late for most tourists."
6997,"We just stayed in this hotel realizing the reviews after booking it and with a bit of fear.  Location: Great, you are in the upper parts of Gothic Quarter, close to Metro and Ramblas is only 10 mins walk.  Room: Comfortable bed, very clean, unusual exposed brick decor through out hotel and rooms.   Breakfast: Did not book after seeing the pictures, however, if you do a city break and stay in an area with so many patisseries and tapas restaurants/bakeries, why on earth would you want to pay for breakfast?  View: None, you open window (you must ask reception to unlock), and you see another window looking at you. But this is Gothic quarter, what d you expect, very narrow streets means very close buildings.  Price: Really good, compare it to other hotels, much cheaper for the…"
6999,"Only stayed at this hotel for a quick two nights, after we left another hotel we were not happy with (separate point). We found this one online kind of last minute and it did the trick at the moment. Positives are the location, the staff are very fast and professional with all requests, and the entire stay had no hiccups. Negatives are the room was smaller than we would have preferred, but oh well. Free wifi worked well and was free, the concierge was helpful, and we enjoyed the breakfast."
7000,Very clean well presented premises with friendly staff!! Very noisy from unit above and also early start and noisy from construction site breaking up concrete from next door!!! Also Wifi not at all reliable and would come in and out continually!!!  
7001,"I just checked in and was told by the unapologetic desk clerk that, even though I am a Platinum Member, they did not have the room I specifically reserved with two beds.  My options were to take a room with one bed or see if another hotel could take me (at 1:00am).  Very disappointed to be treated so poorly upon arrival, and even more disappointed that the desk clerk didn't seem to care.  Don't stay here unless you like to be let down."
7002,"The hotel is right next to a red metro lines exit and it didn't take us long to get to the city center. The roof pool was very refreshing after days walk in the sunshine.   We had a king size bed which was very nice, the only down size was that we were on the third floor and could hear all the noise from the street at nights. The room doors aren't soundproofed (there is a gap between floor and door), so depending on your neighbors you either sleep well or not.    The room was spacious, we had good wifi and TV had also other English speaking channels than news channels (for example discovery). The breakfast had a bit extra than just the basic bread, cereal, egg and sausages (for example one morning there was spinach pie). The service at the front desk was very friendly."
7004,"I had one of the worst front desk experiences of my life at Staypineapple Chicago on Saturday, July 27 (3:00 pm). The front desk personnel were rude and disrespectful  from the moment we set foot in the lobby. Hey messed up our reservation and then blamed us for the mistake. No apology from him, just more attitude. I will never return and would not recommend this hotel to anyone!   P.S. the only bright spot in our stay was Alex the bellhop, who was courteous and polite."
7005,"This hotel is beautiful, very modern and the staff are lovely!  Using your room card to access the lift is great as you can only access the floor you are staying on.  The rooms are very small but fine for us as we were a couple but not sure it would be great if sharing with a friend, not much room plus you can see into the shower again no big deal as a couple but it is only frosted glass so I would feel uncomfortable of with a friend.  The beds are extremely comfortable but the pillows are horrific! They are far to soft even with two we never slept well, we just melted right into them.  Hotel location is fantastic, 5 min walk from centre of Alexanderplatz and Hofbrauhaus. Train station, trams and underground also 5 min walk.    I would most definitely stay at the hotel again."
7006,The hotel was very nice and the room pleasant with a fridge and hob which was useful .The man working on reception should consider another profession as he was not at all helpful .  The hotel should also consider placing felt under the legs of their furniture as the sound of the cleaners constantly shifting furniture on the tiles was quite intrusive when trying to relax beside the pool .  I thought it was nice that there were free movie channels available on the television.
7007,"Front desk staff were extremely rude during the check in process. Once I arrived to my room after a long day of travel and work, I was in need of a meal, I called the room service line to order and it was ringing busy.  I called the front desk and they tried to patch me through and no one picked up the phone once again.  I called once more to the front desk for help, she informed me that room service stopped already although the menu stated ""all day dining"" she hung up the phone on me mid-sentence.  This was all within the first 30 minutes of my arrival.  Fast Forward to the next morning; I smell cigarette smoke inside of my room, I call downstairs to inform the front desk since I am allergic to smoke, they said they would send someone right away, that never happened, I smelled…"
7008,"This hotel is a very beautiful hotel located in one of the best areas of Paris. The rooms are really nice even if small. Breakfast is not the best one I have found but there is nothing missing. If you want to spend very nice days in Paris with great service and place, this is the right hotel. "
7009,"After staying at the Ihilani Resort & Spa at Ko Olina several times and then staying here was horrible. Crowded, loud, unfriendly staff not to mention that we had a hat, silver bracelet come up missing :(  So disappointed in the sale of the Ihilani! Going to have to go to Maui or Kauai from now on!"
7011,"We initially struggled to find the hotel purely with the road system of Cannes. However, when we arrived the staff could not be more helpful. When we went into our room we were pleasantly surprised at it's cleanliness but also it was decorated fantastically and the bed was extremely comfortable. Would definitely stay again. We were vey reluctant to leave! "
7012,"The Hotel Da Vinci is truly beautiful in many regards: it's small, which makes it extremely cozy. The rooms are spacious for Paris standards and they're in great conditions. Included in the reservation they offer an hour at the SPA, which is more like just a pool, but it's truly relaxing to escape either the heat or the cold of Paris, before a long day walking around. Finally, it's location is perfect: it's in the heart of beautiful Saint Germain, close to Notre Dame, close to the river, close to the Louvre, so that one can really get the best of everything by staying there. As a final note, staff is extremely kind and caring. In conclusion, a very cute boutique hotel!"
7015,"The hotel was cheap, the bed was fairly comfortable and the TV worked but they were the only positives I could take out of my stay there.  The only lighting in the rooms were lamps and one had a cut cord and didn't work the other one was in a power point that had blown so didn't work. There was one beside the bed that thankfully was ok.  The fridge froze everything.  Amenities in room advertised were not provided eg no means to make coffee, and 24 hour reception did not exist.  Would not recommend this hotel nor would I stay there again.  "
7016,"From the outside this hotel looks great, and the lobby is well presented. However as you get past the bright exterior things quickly start to look pretty tired.   The rooms are fine, though they're certainly a bit worn and our ones were not particularly spacious.  It's a similar story in the bar, which has a distinct 1980s airport lounge feel, though the staff were all very friendly.  Overall it was fine for our trip, but the rooms could definitely do with a refurb."
7017,"These villas are in beautiful caves at the very tip of Oia in a spot ideal for watching the sunset and for excellent views.   However - we had a few issues during our stay.  1. This property is very far from where you can park a car, so you need to be prepared for a decent walk any time you want to leave or return to the villa.  2. When we checked in to our room we found a set of men's underpants in the bathroom. We asked for them to be removed twice before I had to hand them to a staff member.  3. Breakfast buffet goes until 10.30am. We had it on one of the four mornings at the property and it was very good. Another day we arrived at 10.23am and there wasn't any food left. My partner asked the kitchen staff if they could prepare something for us as there was nothing left and…"
7018,"We really enjoyed this hotel. It is on a quiet street a couple blocks from  the Metro station. When we arrived our room was not ready because it was so early. We were able to store our luggage and Maris at the front desk was awesome! She was very helpful and informative regarding the area and things to do. Her customer service skills are excellent! The Eiffel tower is about a 20 minute walk or so and there is a great view of it while approaching the Hotel Eden. The room was a bit small and the toilet was by itself in a closet but it was all good. The rooms were super clean. There are some restaurants, grocery stores and coffee shops a very short walking distance from this hotel. I would definitely recommend staying here. The price was right as well!!"
7019,Had a pretty lackluster stay. When checking in the reception person had an issue that my credit card had both my name and my husband's name on it. I had to produce evidence that I was allowed the use the card - the card with my name on it. I was asked a few times to verify that my spouse was not traveling with me (as if I was there for some shady purpose) and then had to call him to speak with the reception. I was treated like a thief. Humiliating. A business associate stated she had a similar odd experience with the same staffer and thought it was just her.   The elevator is slow and during my stay was often not working. The hotel bar was overpriced - $16 for a basic brand glass of wine that was $4 or $5 at a restaurant. Sheets had weird stains on them - blood? Chocolate?…
7020,So many things I would like to complain about not enough time. For starters room was not cleaned throughly. One elevator was working during a very very busy time the weekend plus it was st Patrick’s day weekend. 
7021,"Best thing, wife was excellent, everything else AWFUL I travelled from London here on business and needed to work one weekend, the business centre is a small space outside the elevators not he 5th floor, an open space so you have all the guests passing you and it is not quiet at all, it is freezing too and next to the room for the maids so not at all relaxing.   Maid service do not speak english, useless asking them for extra towels Menu in restaurant in absolutely abysmal.  For a 4 start hotel I expect to be able to eat something, i would rather visit mcdonald's.  Gym, well I have seen many hotel gyms in the 4 star range, i travel regularly for work but I have never seen anything like this I went to the shop in the hotel tonight bought a small bottle of water, small only for…"
7022,"The location of the suites is perfect for a curious traveler, surrounded by main sight-seeing attractions in close proximity. Check-point Charlie is just 3 mins by walking (It’s also a stop for Hop-in Hop-off buses, Brandenburg Tour 30 mins, Alexander Platz and Sony Centre 20 mins). Kochstrasse (line U6) is the S-banh station in 3 mins by feet. It was quite calm and relaxing to stay in upper-floor room. Even we didn’t book breakfast in advance, we decide to have it almost every morning (stay for 6 nights).  Good variety of everything: fruits & vegetables, ham & cheese, bread, coffee & tea, juices & water, sausages and scrambled eggs. The staff and service are nice and friendly.  I was a bit surprised by the bathroom suppliers: it were not only shampoo, bath shower, hand wash and…"
7023,"We chose this hotel based on TripAdvisor reviews. However, it did not work out well for us. The front desk staff were off hand, unhelpful and unintrested. When we asked about restaurants a guy gave us a small map with a scribbling on it and said : there.   The location is OK but could be better, the street in front of the hotel was not so nice.   The hotel has 11 Floors but only two small lifts. Breakfast was ok, but even though there were plenty of staff you never got more Coffee from them.   The worst thing was the bathroom. The shower did not work properly, you had to be really strong to change it to syphon mode. And on the last day... there was No hot water. I went to complain, initially it was like ""it's your problem"", they only started to be interated when I told them I…"
7024,Very clean. Very quiet. Good location. Friendly staff.  Free wifi. Nice breakfast  nothing is too much trouble. Walk to most locations from here. Aircon works very well.  Lift is quite small but the stairs are easy to climb. 
7025,"It's a great location in a beautiful building that's well maintained but service and quality of food is way below what is expected from a 5 star hotel. Bedding was muggy due to humidity, staff are not very familiar with good service, much of the breakfast seemed recycled and not very fresh. I stayed at 2 other hotels from the MGallery collection in Vietnam and had very different experiences. I cannot understand the inconsistent service and quality standards."
7028,"30mn for check in, reservations not found completely; slow service, we only positive point is the location but you have no many other hotels around , you can only make better choices  This is a typical airport hotel where the customer is only welcome to pay the bill"
7029,"We were in town for a concert and didn't want to drive the 3+ hours home through pitch black country afterwards, so we booked this hotel based off the reviews and moderate price well ahead of time.  We didn't have time before the concert to check in, so we checked in after the concert (10:30 pm).  There was no available parking at the hotel.  We had to park in an unsecure bank parking lot next door, which worried us because this is not the best area ever.  Get to the room and it stinks...literally stinks.  We quickly realized the smell mostly came from the bed, which was tiny and hard as a rock.  We turned on the AC and it started making a god awful noise.  Because of all of this, we called the front desk and asked to be moved to another room.  They refused and insisted on…"
7030,"Wonderful location at the top of the hill above the sacre cour. Waking distance to good restaurants and sights but lots of hills and steps. Breakfast was good, quiet romantic hotel ideally for couples. Modern small rooms with quirky decor. Highly recommend and would definitely return. "
7031,"The hotel is lovely, set high above Funchal with great views from the terrace. The public areas are attractive with lots of casual seating, an indoor and outdoor pool and gym. Our room on the 4th floor was a decent size and comfortable, with a balcony with sea views.  The bed was firm and comfortable but the pillows were small and not very supportive  The service was definitely not 5 stars. When we wanted drinks at the main or pool bars we had to go in search of someone to serve us. In our room I was surprised that the glasses we used for water were not replaced. The restaurant service could be slow but 30 minutes was the longest we had to wait for the first course.  We were staying half board and were offered set menus for the evening meal. I didn't find this a problem as the…"
7032,"Location is good. Staff are friendly but decor is dated. Breakfast isn't great, I think it's about the level of a travelodge. Bar at night is good, great drinks and friendly staff. Bedding is horrible and clearly washed in harsh chemicals. "
7033,"Thank you so much for accommodating us during our extended layover in Paris. We arrived around 9 am, exhausted from a sleepless overnight flight and the incredible staff were able to arrange early check-in for us even though it was the Bastille holiday weekend. We were in the room by 11, showered and finally getting some much needed sleep. The room had everything needed, A/C worked well, and the bed was very comfortable. If we are ever in Paris again, we would definitely return to this hotel. "
7035,The hotel has all the basics needed for a short stay. The hotel is a bit of a walk from all the major sites but is doable. The room has basic furniture and bedding however it is spacious and bathroom is big too. Breakfast area is big and food is plentiful. I stayed two nights and the place was perfect for anyone in a mid-range budget.
7036,"Pros  Breakfast buffet included something for everyone - fresh and re-stocked often Most times you could find a lounge chair pool side or on the beach Evening live music by the pool  Cons Overall, the hotel is understaffed which = poor service  Many of the common areas were poorly maintained and cleaned Rooms were not completely updated and cleaned  Our group of 7 arrived just after the holiday rush. Upon arrival at the hotel, things were hectic. We were never properly greeted and just made our own way to the front desk, never getting a lei greeting or welcome drink. Not that I cared about having those, but it pretty much set the tone for the trip and it is not the usual service I have received from other Four Seasons.   We stayed 6 nights and for the entire trip, things were…"
7037,"Overall nothing to complain about this is a budget hotel and the room we stayed in was perfectly clean and kept clean by staff everyday. No Teas and coffee in rooms but available downstairs if required. Breakfast is continental but there is a well laid out table where you just help yourself. Ideal location for trams, S-Bahn and U-Bahn as well as fast trains DB from Schonefield airport only 40 mins away. Good for on going transport to the city centre and main attractions. Ideal base for trip to Berlin"
7038,"  Since i arrived the service were bad.    I and my wife handle our own bagage while it was raining.    Bad breakfast.   We are really upset about that hotel.   In front of the Beach, a good place in Copacabana. good view of the Beach."
7039,"The location and the room were very nice. Friendly and dedicated staff but not enough members according the price we were paying per night. We were expecting some more staff, even if the cook and the concierge were really kind and efficient. Pool area also great but no one was serving in the pool bar.  "
7040,"Fantastic hotel in a nice location with plenty of Turkish eating places amongst others. Bus stop directly outside hotel, U-bahn and S-bahn also close within 10 minutes walking distance. We got a train to Berlin Hbf and took a bus from the station straight to the hotel, the journey took about 20 minutes. We were then able to purchase group travel tickets which could be used all day on buses, trains, metro and trams for €20 which was a good deal for for a family of four. One bus can take you directly to various locations such as Alexandraplaz and Potsdamer Platz. The staff were also super friendly! The only drawback was not having a kettle in the room. However if you ask at reception they can give you a jug of hot water. Or you can purchase a hot drink for about €2. Overall had a…"
7041,Pipe burst in room and had to change rooms. It was not a hotel - more like a hostel :( This was for a business trip and I needed a good nights rest - Should have been refunded or discounted for the inconvenience. Was not. 
7042,"This time i was here out of season. I got an upgreaded room for great suite. Really good clean and nice. Great location, and bery good service in hotel. The bed very good and comfortable. Shower is great. I will always come back here."
7043,"We traveled with two kids (<2yrs) in a king suite with sofa bed which gave me worst Marriott experience as Gold Elite member. First, we requested a crib which wasn’t prepared. The one provided was broken so had to request again. Secondly, sink was broken so water wasn’t flowing out. Lastly and most importantly, room wasn’t cleaned. Room smelt stinky when we entered but wasn’t sure what it was. Next morning we began fixing baby’s meal, we found there is a gabage can full with previous guest’s. Housekeeping manage came and cleaned but stinky smell wasn’t go away. They offered bonus Bonvoy point and late checkout but we checked out as soon as possible because we concerned about kids health."
7044,"Myself and my partner stayed here for his 30th birthday treat away.  On arrival we were greeted by a friendly member of staff on reception and they went through the check in process although we couldn’t have our room as it was morning when we arrived.  We were allowed to leave our luggage so we could begin enjoying the sights and on our return later that day the key card was ready and waiting for us.  The room was lovely and clean although a little dark due to the decor but it added to the Parisian charm, the bed was so comfy and perfect for sinking into after a long day walking and sight seeing!  The location of the hotel was near perfect as it was 1min walk to the metro stop and this made getting to all the major sights within minutes (maps on iPhones are a god send as they…"
7045,"We had a mix up with our initial hotel and booked BW Liege once in Paris.  Anna booked 2 lovely superior rooms for us (next to each other) and treated us like stars.  Rooms are large, modern and clean with the feel of a boutique hotel.  Location was great.  We walked to Montmartre one day and down to Galeries Lafayette the next.  The best part was by far the staff at the hotel.  Anna, Peter, Jonathan and the manager from the UK (sorry if I misspelled the names) went above and beyond to make sure we we had a great weekend.  I highly recommend staying at this lovely hotel.   Thanks so much BW Premier Opera Liege   Lisa"
7046,"We stayed at the hotel Max when it was  very warm in Amsterdam, this of course was lovely, but  we found it hard to keep the room cool  due to its size, however  the shower was clean and the breakfast was  your basic cereal and toast.  The hotel is not far from the city centre by tram it takes 5 minutes,  the Lidl across the road is useful and the Coffee shop ibiza is also very close.  Its your typical cheap hotel in Amsterdam,  dont believe the other reviews saying its ghastly, its just you get what you pay for and Amsterdam isnt the cheapest city to stay in.  "
7047,"I soo soo wanted to give this place 5 stars but my experience was otherwise. First of all, we had a room that was right next to a big airconditioning fan that blew all day. The moment we opened our room we heard a blaring big fan. At the prices that we paid for a suite here, this should not have happened at all. Second, we got a massage here which was also extremely expensive but was rushed and not at all skillful. I felt that  the masseuse was just rubbing my body randomly and I was in pain for a day after the massage. The co-ed waiting lounge area also was loud and noisy. felt more like a bar than a spa. Lastly, the hotel cleaning crew is not synchronized with the registration system. Three times someone from housekeeping entered our room while we were there...not cool. The…"
7048,"3 couples met in Berlin to go to a guns n roses concert and stayed at the Moxy Berlin. The hotel is located a 3min walk to the train station with excellent links around the city and airport. Very convenient.  The hotel is new and we all loved the atmosphere and decor of it. The hotel is extremely well presented and all the staff were very friendly and helpful. They put up little hearts in our room and gave us a free drink each when they heard we just got engaged which was a lovely touch.  They even let us check in early so we could go to collect our concert tickets.  24hr pizzas were lovely and the hotel bar was quite busy with a good vibe on our return around 1am.  We enjoyed 3 nights here. Smart tvs in the rooms, comfy beds, lovely clean showers with great water pressure.  We…"
7049,"My husband and I were in town for a friend's wedding and stayed at theWit because that's where the bride set up the block of rooms, hospitality suite, etc.  Since I booked the two nights separately, I was told that they were going to be placing two holds for incidentals. I gave the desk clerk one card to pay for the room and another for the holds. I was a little frazzled and must have not been clear because she placed one hold on the card with the room and the other hold on the other card. Once in the room, I called down to the front desk to see if they could roll over the hold from the first night to the second night. I was told that a manager needed to help and one would call me back. That didn't happen. I also noticed some of the room details were not in good condition, such…"
7050,The hotel staff were lovely and we got an amazing gift for our wedding anniversary. It’s always the small things that matter most! Our room was spacious and so so comfy! The bed and pillows were just fabulous! The pool and wellness center was an amazing perk too!  You will need to get a taxi or underground to the center but it’s worth the travel! (Only 10 min drive - approx 11€ ) 
7051,After arriving and Paris and having to change hotels we selected this one! Best choice we made the whole 3 week trip. They have the best staff  and everyone at the hotel was amazing and friendly and helpful!   We booked through an online booking site and it was not successful because of the timing it took to process and the room no longer being available for one of the nights. Eduardo and the other front desk attendants made sure we got into a room and that we would be comfortable for our entire stay!   The welcome drink at check in and breakfast each other were delicious.  The staff even went as far as checking on us for when we would be leaving the room on day so they could attend the room.   We would 1000% recommend this hotel to everyone and anyone!
7052,"I got eaten alive at night, I awoke with bites all over my face and body which really ruined my trip. The hotel seems nice and clean, and my room was nice but the pillows or mattresses need updating or a good clean as I suspect there may be bed bugs. "
7053,"We booked a 7 seat car to Ho Chi Minh and got a very small car. Chewing gum was sticked on the belt, very bad experience with this taxi. The hotel itself is nice but the restaurant is not really good and the beach was full of sand fly. Not convenient with kids. "
7054,"I stayed at this hotel on Friday, February 22.  Beginning around 1:00 a.m. the couple in the room next to mine had a very loud altercation.  They screamed and cursed and slammed things around until I knocked on the wall.  They then spent the next 2 hours having extremely loud sex - the woman was literally screaming.  There were multiple drunk people in the hallways running from room to room, slamming doors, etc.  The walls and doors are very thin and you can hear everything going on in the hall.  I was in town for business and only got about 2 hours worth of sleep.  Absolutely ridiculous.  I expected more from this hotel."
7055,"I hardly ever write reviews.  Unfortunately, circumstances dictate that I do.  So, I arrived to the hotel and the building had nice curb appeal.  Although, there was a huge puddle of standing water in the street in front of the building.  I had high hopes walking in the door.  Unfortunately, after walking in, it was very different.  The lobby was quite small (not necessarily a bad thing for a ""boutique hotel"").  The desk clerk checked me in and gave me my keys.  She was pleasant.  Upon going to my room, I came to the door to find it ajar.  The cleaning lady was still inside cleaning the room.  It seemed to me to be a lack of communication between housekeeping and the front desk.  Nevertheless, I didn't give it too much thought.  After she finished, I checked out the room and…"
7056,"The hotel is very nice and served superb but it's a shame that the bar and restaurant at terribly expensive competing the prices you find around. The spa is also poor, this should be free entry. After being in many starwood hotels I don't really think that the spa meet the standards."
7057,This was the worst hotel stay of my life. Not only are the rooms disgusting and you’re stuck at an airport but This hotel will nickel and dime you for everything. Most of which would be free at any other hotel. Don’t ever stay here!!
7059,"Stayed here two nights. After the first, noticed an insect bite/area of irritation that I didn't think had been there before--but I wasn't sure. The second morning, there was no question--new bites, four around my stomach, several on my backside, one on my foot, and one behind my knee. The one behind my knee I was able to show to the front desk manager on checkout, and she immediately dismissed it as a mosquito bite. (Pretty sure she's wrong; it doesn't itch like mosquito bites do.) I took my shoe partway off to show her the bite on my foot, which she agreed didn't look like a mosquito bite. That one she attributed, again immediately and without close inspection (nor, I assume, a degree in dermatology) to a spider, and she started to stand up, saying that she was going to go up…"
7060,Sheraton BA reminds of what happens when you don't change with time. The rooms are very basic with only one plug point. The lighting in the room is pretty mediocre making the room look pretty dull. Basic amenities like an iron and ironing board are missing from the room. Room service takes almost an hour to reach you by which time you have already lost your hunger. The floor in my cupboard had a massive water leakage. No plug points besides your table which means you kind enjoy your Netflix or Kindle on our bed unless your device is fully charged. TV had only few Spanish channels so would remain switched off if you are a foreigner. Alas the only saving grace is the location as it's situated in the city centre. Overall strictly avoidable. 
7061,"I would like to say, I am very disappointed with this hotels lack of treatment. As a Diamond member with the Hilton program and stayed in many fine Hilton properties around the world, I asked for a upgrade to the presidential suite or imperial suite and was told neither were available (20:00). As I have booked the room below these two rooms.  I was told by the front desk person who said she was the manager that it was not possible to have either type of room. I was contacted by the Hilton Honors program via email 2 days early stating they had a room reserved for me that was a level below the Presidential suite and very special. I showed this email to the front desk manager and she said this room was not available.   I looked online through the Hilton app and both were shown…"
7062,"My wife and I stayed here for a week at the start and 3 days at the end of our 5 weeks in France. We have travelled extensively over the last 10 years and can say unequivocally this hotel had the most genuinely friendly and professional staff we have ever encountered. Sara and Alexandre on the front desk were just so friendly and helpful. Fati who looked after breakfast was so warm and welcoming and provided a lovely breakfast. All the other staff from reception or room servicing were also great. The hotel itself is really chic and decorated very nicely. The room was immaculate, decorated very nicely in keeping with the rest of the hotel. The bed was comfortable and the a/c worked well. Every room had a complimentary mobile phone you could take out of the hotel, this was so convenient as we weren't forever looking for cafe's just to get wifi, meaning we could use Google maps to navigate easiiaround Paris. We could not recommend this hotel any higher and look forward to our next stay.…"
7063,The Amrath is undoubtedly a beautiful hotel. It has been sympathetically restored from its origins and is historically fascinating.  That said we experienced a few issues with our stay that were a little disappointing.  Firstly the hotel was unbelievably hot. It’s a historic building and they can’t / won’t install air conditioning so the heat was stifling. Indeed we were provided with a fan for the evenings but the room was large and it offered little respite. Despite the incredibly comfortable bed with the great sheets sleep was elusive.  When we arrived late in the evening and noticed there was no bed in the room for our daughter we requested this from reception and it took 45 minutes to arrive. And 50E more a night on the bill.  And lastly the small incident of a piece of…
7064,Hotel Crowne Plaza in the center of Berlin next door to the Zoo and Kurfurstendam is a well run hotel with nice facilities including pool and sauna. The breakfast is excellent and the service is very fine. Rooms are quiet and still a few meters away from the main shopping street.
7065,Probably one of the worst experiences I have ever encountered. Staff at the hotel were extremely unhelpful and rude. Basically they ignored us. This kind of service in the hotel industry is really unacceptable. Will not be back for sure.
7067,"This hotel is brand new and is very nice BUT it has some serious problems you should know about.  As I write this review it is 7:30 in the morning and I can still hear the ringing of building construction across the street. The construction went on through the whole night and there just doing the foundation work.  So there another year or two of this, UGH!!  Also the beds are the worst I have ever seen and felt in the world.  I stay in hotels 120 nights a year and I know hotel beds. You would think a hotel of this caliber would buy decent beds.  The beds are hard as a rock.  I'm not talking firm here, I'm talking hard and uncomfortable.  This is very unusual for a Marriott Hotel because they usually have great beds.  I will avoid this hotel just because I expect a decent bed. …"
7068,The location its very good. But the photographies in the advertisment were a bit misleading. The apartement is poorly preserved and the water didnt warm up well. We wanted some privacy for that two days but didnt get at all. The service was very kind anyway and value its ok.
7069,"It is good price and close to the centre of Lisbon. It is very close to metro station too. The breakfast wasn't that great as you have a lot of sweet options, no eggs, no tomatoes , cucumbers, etc. The rooms are clean, staff nice and helpful."
7070,We really wanted to like this hotel.  The location is perfect for an early morning flight and the staff both at the front desk and in the dining room are very upbeat and professional. But....we changed rooms twice.  I had requested a room with a bath tub-in writing-more than once.  We were placed in a room with only a shower.  then  we were placed in a room with no telephone service and a non working refrigerator.  the 3rd room had a tub and a working refrigerator and a phone line......but the sink handle fell off when we touched it...I could go on and on.  they need to go through the place and repair all the parts that are broken.  it is not fair to the staff to place people in disfunctioning rooms. Hotel could us a little soundproofing too.  Oh and canned fruit for breakfast! …
7071,"Be careful when make a reservation with this hotel. You may get trapped. I booked the hotel with Arrival Date of 12/14/2015 and Departure Date 12/18/2015, in total FOUR nights. This was confirmed when I checked in. I left in the late night of 12/17/2015 to catch a flight, but paid for four nights. They did not say anything at that time. One day after my departure they charged me for another day w/o my consent! This is a horrible. I am still arguing w/ them through my credit card company. Will keep posted."
7072,"This hotel which at first seems a bit off situated between a building and a train station, is refreshingly a very modern/classy hotel. I can not be more thankful at the location of the hotel which makes access to everything soo easy. As i mentioned the train station is just beside it, which has a bus & taxi stop right infront, a shopping street 200m away, the beach 1 km away, what more could anyone want! Adding to this the hotel from the inside is also so very well built, using the amount of space they had so efficiently and effectively. As mentioned it is a modern hotel, which means the design is very sleak, and simplistic. The rooms are very cool, everything is where you need it to be, with nothing useless provided. The hotel staff is extremely warm, helpful, and the club…"
7073,"Stayed for 3 days,to be near the Christmas markets,it wasn't in the best area,but not bad for getting about, Iris at reception was very helpful and always smiling,and Tomka in the restaurant was a sweetie, The food wasn't that great but passable,and there was a great supermarket round the corner, The rooms were clean oddly laid out but except able for the money, Would recommend for short stays, The only bug bear was,someone had been smoking in our room,and left an ashtray hidden behind a curtain,and no where did I see smoke alarms ,"
7074,"I did not have a good experience with this hotel. Upon arrival in December, I along with four other colleagues were informed that the hotel was fully booked for the first night.  This was frustrating as we were after travelling 12 hours from Ireland and were exhausted. We were taken to another for the night and then stayed the remaining 3 nights in the Park Central.  However, we were told that we would be refunded the first night by the General Manager and again when we checked out.  However, this did not happen.  I have emailed the hotel twice about this and still no reply.  It simply isn't good enough.  We were over on business and the hotel was very central to our needs.  I am very disappointed with the Park Central Hotel."
7075,Stayed at Weelton Riga Hotel & Spa for 3 nights during Easter holiday in April 2019. We wanted to spoil ourselves an booked one of the suites in the hotel with a living room which has a large corner window with a view in addition to a bedroom and bathroom. We were pleasantly surprised of the size of the room and was glad there was aircondition as well since the temperature was good for being april and the sun was really heating the room with the large window.  This good feeling wouldn’t last long. After being out several hours coming back late it was still very warm (+26 C) inside even if the aircondition was on full blast. In addition we found 2 pair of earplugs on the bed table.....which was a bit suspicious (see attached photo). Nothing happened with the temperature and we…
7076,"Our travel agent chose this hotel for us - I wish I'd paid more attention and upgraded to a 4 star.  This is not even a 4 star by UK standards, it's more like a 3.  There was work going on at the hotel and the banging/scraping and general comotion was ridiculous- we were not informed of this at the time of booking.  The dust from all the works dirtied the patio furniture- I actually wrote a little note to them in dust with my finger!!! This trip was 7 months ago now and from the other reviews it still seems like it's going on.  The breakfast was awful as well, plastic cheese and stale bread.    The positives were a good location on the beach and the roof terrace is quite nice with good views.  However, there are plenty of hotels along the strip - choose another.  We wished we'd…"
7077,"I really enjoyed my stay here. My room was spacious and well equipped with a nice view over the square opposite. Housekeeping was excellent - the room was spotless, despite my efforts :) and the breakfast buffet was superb. All the staff were helpful and friendly and I was able to check in early and check out and hour late with no extra charge. I didn't have time to use the pool area, but it looks very nice (although the pool itself is rather small). The free mini-buffet in the early evening is a good idea, with various snacks and drinks available from 17h-21h. Good value for money, I would definitely choose this hotel again."
7079,"Stayed here  twice before with a cold welcome from reception. This time arrived early evening and we were checked in by the lovely Marija.  The room was amazing Superior deluxe. Spacious with an amazing view. The staff were a friendly bunch and made us feel welcome.  Lovely high standard of room with great decor and view.  The only disappointment was the empty shower gel. However ,reception soon fixed this small inconvenience.   The breakfast was 18e, this has to be the best breakfast in Berlin, choice and freshness was 5 star. We did not eat dinner as the price was not competitive, plenty restaurants in the area.  The wardrobe was in the doorway this had no light, battery strip lights were insitu but this was not enough in day or evening, selecting clothes was an issue as was…"
7080,"The room reservation system is complicated in the extreme!  The Cliff Bay Hotel rooms can be Upper Floors- Superior-Sea View-Bay View-Funchal View, etc,etc. When we arrived we were not allocated the room we “thought” we had booked but to be fair we were allocated the room we had paid for.  The  receptionist told us this situation was very rare- this is not true!  Four other couples were checking in at the same time as we were and they ALL had exactly the same room allocation issues. The management really need to streamline the room booking system.  Other than this issue the hotel is good, staff pleasant but as we only had breakfast here can not comment on the restaurants other than to say one of them is very expensive and has probably more style than substance."
7081,Stayed for 3 nights. Team was extremely helpful and made the exprience great. Would surely like to come back.  Would like to name Christine the owner who leads this great reliable team. Enzo was great and devoted to help with any question. Idris was very helpful and accomdated every request. Maris was very reliable at night. Could'nt ask for better help. 
7082,"Comfortable room with king size bed, helpful friendly staff, didn’t try hotel breakfast or bar as they were a bit expensive and there are loads of great cafes and restaurants nearby. Getting around Berlin by public transport and walking was easy from the hotel’s location."
7083,We stayed at the Savoy for my girlfriends birthday and really enjoyed our experience. The location is perfect for a weekend away with local train options around the city and to the airport.   The hotel has a relaxing atmosphere with attentive staff full of top tips of where to visit. The bedroom was different to the norm with a 4 poster bed and a high spec bathroom.   I'd definitely recommend this hotel as its a good price for a 4* property and it ticked all the boxes for a relaxing weekend stay.  
7084,"I stayed here with my teenage daughter and her friend after a school tour we were on finished up.  We chose to stay behind in Paris for a couple extra days.  Needless to say, after 2 weeks staying at tour group hotels, it was nice to stay somewhere with charm near everything.  We stayed in the triple room. Plenty of room for 3.  The room was very clean and bathroom updated and quite modern and large.  The staff was very pleasant.  My inquiries were responded to quickly prior to making the reservation and questions answered accurately.  The location of the hotel is perfect. Close to metro. Close to restaurants. Close to many sights.  Wifi was free and worked well.  Rates were at or less than surrounding hotels that we looked at.  There is breakfast offered for a fee.  We chose to…"
7085,"the main advantage of this hotel is that it is well placed and that it is cheap. And therefore suitable for a one night stay for old people such as us, though i could see it being acceptable for a longer stay for anyone under say 70. The rooms are hard and not all that comfortable but who cares as long as you are not expecting to spend much time there. in our case it was for an early start top the airport.. The check in was cheerfully done and the decor is equally zappy and makes you smile. We were away early so did not get the experience of breakfast. The exterior of the building looks as though it has a history but there was no time to read it up."
7086,The staff is stressed. The breakfast is bad and lacking alot of stuff 15 min after opening. The wifi can't support all the guests. We were lacking warm water one of the days and the hotel rooms equipment are not repaird when broken. Only 2 people who made it worth staying there were Gustavo and Wesley from the reception. Also the only once who talked English. 
7087,"The location is great with easy access to the city and local shops and bars. However, in our apartment there was no opening windows and no air conditioning, it was very hot and very difficult to get a good night sleep. On couple nights it was unbearable and during the night we sat in front of a fan that had been loaned to us. I guess on cold and cooler weather conditions it would not have been a problem.   The apartments are used by groups especially hen parties, this was not a problem until the weekend.   We would not stay at these apartments again. "
7088,Location and security are my two must haves and the Hotel Tilsit Etoile is so very close to the Arc du Triumph and the Metro. You can be anywhere in the city for less than two Euros one way.  The staff is so friendly and helped with every item we requested. I'll stay there again. 
7089,"It was not out first time at this hotel. The friendliness of staff is remarkable but the hotel itself needs a full renovation: rooms, especially bathrooms including. Breakfast is good and the neighbourhood is exciting.  "
7090,"Stayed here for three nights. Location is outside the hustle & bustle of the city centre. Only a taxi ride away from the city and beach area.(taxi cost varied from €6 to €12). The hotel is a good base point located in a quiet area. The hotel facilities are limited and basic but adequate for a short stay. The room was small but clean, plus cleaned everyday by the maids. I couldn't fault the reception staff, helpful and very friendly. Even provide an umbrella for the evening as a result of a heavy downpour. I didn't use the breakfast facility but there are a number of cafe near by. Overall I was satisfied with my stay."
7092,Our stay has been truly enjoyable first cuz our requests had been attended to and secondly for the convenience of the location.. the staff was so helpful from day one and the rooms were perfectly situated...
7093,"I did not stay at the hotel, I booked a conference room for a workshop. The room was ready, but there weren't power outlets around the tables and you must pay for power cords or whatever you need to plug. The coffee break was served after I questioned where was it, as I payed in advance. When the event was finished, no one could tell me if I had to sign something. Ah, and the booking process was also bad. "
7094,"The rooms were beautiful, and the front desk staff made a supreme effort to get good rooms for our party. Based purely on the check-in experience and quality of the room, I would have rated the hotel as Excellent.  On breakfast:  The JW's breakfast was lackluster in selection, but worse, the food was dangerous and poorly cooked. The baked beans were barely cooked and occasionally rock hard, and at least one ""omelet"" that was so raw that it was the consistency of egg drop soup. Whatever you ordered in your omelet, you'd get something else - we never got the actual ingredients we asked for, even when we asked different wait staff. The belgian waffle was inedible, we didn't give it another chance. The distinction between ""crispy"" and ""soft"" bacon was nice on days when they did…"
7095,We were in Berlin for a long weekend and found the hotel perfect for the visit. Very close to the U-bhann and buses. The staff were fantastic particularly Lucca and Flavia who were so helpful in suggesting places to go and how to get there. Everything in the hotel was very clean and comfortable. only slight drawback was a lack of storage space but that is a very minor issue everything else was great including a wonderful breakfast
7096,"If you are going in a business trip to lisbon its a good location however do not expect to receive for what you pay. Plus extra hidden charges apply like the parking, internal organisation and tech seems to.be lost or below on today's standard"
7097,Not great customer service. Stayed here to attend an evening business event. Check in took forever and I said I had a MUA coming for me and a colleague staying there also. Requested she have a key to my room when she checked in to get to my floor (despite asking yo ne on same floor) i still had to have her call me as she checked in to comediwn to sort the extra key. Then the girl n reception went to check her room (didnt do that with me)... for security reasons ??!! no further explanation that took extra time despite us saying we both needed t be showered etc for the MUA arriving in 30mins. I had to come down again to greet the MUA because nobody could seem to organise valet parking when the MUA arrived. The whole experience was a debacle and embarrassing. Stay in Melbourne alot…
7098,"My girlfriend and I stayed this past  Saturday night  and had a terrible experience.  After my keys did not work I went to the desk where I was told it was my fault for them being demagnetized. - Not a very good feeling, especially when you are here for an anniversary getaway. We called and asked  for a  late checkout. However we were shocked when housekeeping walked in on us at 9:30 (after knocking as she was opening the door.) All and all,  not a very big deal, but it ruined my stay.  On a positive side, hotel is brand new and rooms are really nice and clean!"
7099,"Unfriendly staff, judgemental and didn't help with any recommendations when we asked. The room was small as hell and a poor excuse for a ""deluxe queen"" bed. Could be a spot for some, but definitely not us."
7100,"OK, it does feel very much like a 'tourist' hotel, but for the prices it would be difficult to do much better than this large establishment near Grands Boulevards Métro stop. We were probably particularly lucky with our corner room, but it was among the largest I have seen in mid-price Paris hotels. And notably quiet (especially if you get a room ""qui donne sur la cour"". It's a friendly establishment too. Breakfast adequate going-on good. Oddity? No booze to buy on the premises!"
7101,"Very modern and clean room, unfortunately the air conditioning is not to efficient for my liking. It is set through the TV and the lowest setting was 21 degrees. This left the room quite warm. It was however a very hot weekend when I was there."
7102,Location is excellent to explore the old city and jogging along the river. Buffet breakfast is rather limited and local varieties are missed. Usually reception is very busy early weekday mornings with business types. I had a renovated room that was simply correct.
7104,"A five star hotel must change its windows when the flight traffic is noisy. Could not fall asleep until after midnight, was awaken around 7, this has changed in the last ten years but Pestana has not invested in its guests’ sleep. The historic part of the hotel is as gorgeous as ever. The suite (same as several years ago) was comfortable and had been refreshed. The pre-arrival was nothing to report, nobody asked about tastes, dietary requirements or needs before our arrival (this was done at the Tivoli where we had stayed the previous week). No water on night stands every night but one liter bottle in the living room, a nice serving of fresh fruit. Some members of the staff were excellent, such as the young man welcoming us at the entrance and accompanying us to the spa in cool…"
7105,"Wonderful location. The main attractions of this small-ish boutique hotel are the very nice details, such as lots of pillows, big windows, friendly staff, and a fabulous Continental breakfast. The quiet courtyard below is another plus. The bed and the shower were both great. There is an elevator. On check-in you'll be given a handy fold-out map that shows all kinds of useful places nearby. Like most hotel rooms in Europe, the room is not much bigger than the bed - but there is a proper desk and chair, and good lighting."
7107,"Fabulous location in a great area, close to many boutiques/cafes/restaurants. The staff were so welcoming and helpful, and the room was very comfortable. Didn't get a chance to use the spa but great to have this option if we needed it. Will definitely be booking to come back again."
7109,"We stayed in this hotel for our honeymoon for 3 nights. The location was fantastic, in the middle of all great restaurants and shops and within walking distance to most tourist spots (hop on hop off spot was a 2-3 min walk from the hotel). The staff were extremely helpful and friendly and the room we stayed in was beautiful, with a balcony that looked over the main strip. The only downside was that our double bed was 2 single mattresses joined together, this was a little uncomfortable if you were in the middle of the bed. Would however recommend this hotel, as positives far outweigh this minor negative. "
7110,"The hotel was not was I expected based on the pictures. My check-in said 3:00 PM on my documentation wasn't allowed to check in until four. Hotel is very very outdated and to top it off there was a roach in the room, was suppose to stay another night after my cruise but canceled and stayed somewhere else... Will never pick this hotel again. Water was stopped up in bathtub we had to wait 30 minutes for next person to take a shower... Smh :-("
7111,"In the past 2-3 years, I have been putting up at this hotel during my business trips to Shanghai. In terms of location, It was close to places of business I usually visits, thus the choice.  Average stays stretches at least over a week to 3 weeks. But, nothing at this Hilton has managed to impress me enough to praise and recommend it. In fact, disappointment is the least word to use. This is taken into consideration when I compare my various Hilton experiences in different cities across APAC. In particular, when comparing Hilton Wangfujing Beijing and Hilton Shanghai.   My Saturday morning was rudely disturbed by loud door banging, a whole tribe of people shouting and talking above average noise level!!! I had to call the Magic line to complain and investigate the situation.…"
7112,"Great location just in front of the sacré coeur, staff couldn't have been more friendly or helpful and the hostel was very clean and comfortable. Two minutes walk from the metro so easy to get around everywhere. Me and my partner stayed in a private double room with our own bathroom and it was perfect. Obviously because it's primarily a youth hostel and beside a bar it can be noisy at night but it usually quieted down not long after midnight. The hostel also has a nice private terrace on the first floor where you can sit in the sun. It was about 40 euro each for us each night which is great for Paris and if the prices do not increase I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to my friends. "
7113,"Booked a suite for 3 of my elders and to start with, they forgot to put enough duvet in the rooms! Staff kept interrupting them at dinner that your dinner isn't part of the booking !! of course you eat first and then you pay, right?? Especially when they had the credit card authorisation for that!! simply unbelievable!! It's been over 2 months and I'm still waiting for the copy of final bill!! Chased them eneormous times and gave up. telling the world now so anyone reading this can be careful.."
7114,"I'll lead by stating that our standards are not overly high.  I booked this hotel on points for one last night in Rio based in large part on reviews from this site.  Now I'm counting down the hours until we can go.    When we arrived, a large contingent had shown up just before us and they had ONE person checking them all in.  So we waited half an hour before giving up (even though we'd been on a plane all day), leaving our bags with security and going out for a late lunch. (we arrived around 15:00, so well past check-in time).  When we came back an hour later, they were STILL being checked-in.  Finally, we got a room key - note that the front desk staff is neither overly welcoming nor helpful and English is not readily spoken - and made our way up to a room that is ...well,…"
7115,"My husband and I went for a budget room for a Birthday trip and chose Riverside due to it's excellent location.  The staff were friendly and the room itself was basic, but clean and warm. The facilities were again basic but covered all our needs.  The beds were very comfortable and the room had an excellent shower.  There are no frills here but it's a great option for the budget traveller, within walking distance of many attractions and transport links."
7116,"I stayed in Ibis styles alexanderplatz hotel and I enjoyed your hostpetality during my vacation in Berlin. I found clean room and central hotel and a welcome reception girl named Miroslava Dimitriva. she helped us a lot - warm , nice and caring woman with a large heart that was responded to all ours needs.  We want to thank her a lot and to send her our warming blessing for her work that made our vacation wonderful !  I wish all your workers will be like her - because of Miroslava Dimitrova our next visit in Berlin will be in your hotel!"
7117,"We stayed here overnight before an international trip. We arrived and elected to take an ""upgrade"" sum of $125 (plus the initial $200 for the room). The upgrade was crap. We got to the top floor and could see a couple of airplanes but there was a cable under the carpet that I tripped on, lights that didn't work, and no microwave to heat food.  I called the front desk and they stated there would be an extra $30 charge for a microwave.  They charge for EVERYTHING! I will not stay at this property again. It is better to take a FREE shuttle and get more amenities from an adjencent property."
7118,"There is no mention that you have to go between two resorts to get all the facilities advertised. Village is old fashion, no internet, dark no way a Gold Crown it is linked to MiraMar which probably gives them the Gold. Pestana is running its own points system making it hard to get availability as most of the guests we meet were on a freebie with Pestana to buy their product. Maybe thats why when booking 10 months in advance we could not get into Carlton/Grand and other better ones as the units are being used by Pestana as a Sales gimmick. RCI are losing it, in the past you could always book a gold crown and it be excellent. Their exchange fee of £159.00 makes it a very expensive holiday on top of paying maintenance."
7119,"I cannot believe all the positive reviews this hotel has received. I had a nightmare experience on my business trip, and one that did not seem like a one-off issue.  1. I made a reservation online and booked at a specific rate. When I checked into the hotel, the reservation number was associated with someone else's name, and they tried to charge me an incredibly inflated rate (5x what I'm currently seeing on TripAdvisor...). The worst part--they blamed ME, questioning me after I had shown them my reservation email sent directly from the hotel: ""Are you sure you don't have the broken down rate per day?""  2. Hotel is old and noisy. The people who have said it's ""new"" and ""modern""--no idea what hotel you were staying at. This feels like a slightly nicer Holiday Inn, but I paid…"
7121,"Central location in a pretty new hotel. Friendly staff, great beds, simple, but all you need to rest well. Stayed there a couple of times already and will go back for sure. Parking right behind the hotel is great, The value for money is good and the condition of the place is great. You can also try the Budget version of Ibis right next door, which is also pretty good, I have to say. To be honest, I like the new Ibis concept, so I bought their membership card. Not all IBIS places are that great, but this one is worth every penny in the center of Berlin."
7122,"The hotel is well suited position for the exhibition centre. Rooms are good clean and the views over the river are stunning. Some online booking sites show the hotel on the opposite side of the river. Do not bother with an upgrade on the meal deal. All of the food is pathetic, nowhere near international hotel standard, very disappointed. I guess the fact that there are very few guests dinning there says something about it.  The staff are nice."
7123,"Ms. Comins, has no time for you and will not see you to address your issues or concerns. Basically, she does not care you don’t matter. After, I was told that the manager would be right out and waited 25 minutes for the front desk clerk to come out and had me her business card. When asked if she was going to come out and speak with me, I was told no. WOW!! "
7125,"No minibar, dirty walls and a to high price of 130€ without breakfast. I had also a demage of the wardrobe and a bloody hurt and infromed the staff, but got no excuses and benefit! No usefull map of the gouverment transportation, there is a lot of ""room for improvement""!"
7126,"Tried charging us for mini bar we hadn’t used  Breakfast buffet the food was cold  Had to pick our car up out in the rain  Food and drink prices extremely expensive  I had left my phone in car on arrival and asked for the car to be brought back or phone to be brought to me, was told phone would be brought to my room, hour later I went down to ask about phone and they had forgot about it another 15 minuets later ( waiting down stairs in the cold) I finally had my phone"
7127,"I pre-paid for my hotel from 07/16/16-07/19/16.  My family arrives at the hotel around 7:30pm and then was told that they cancelled my room for the night and sent us to Naperville which was 55 minutes away.  I called on 07/16 to verify that everything was okay before we flew out.  As a loyal Marriott member for 20 years, this is unacceptable!  This hotel did us a disservice and put a huge wrinkle into our family vacation.  They cannot he trusted  and Marriott will not be my 1st choice anymore for pleasure or business!  I will commend the staff that had to give us the bad news.  They handled it the best they could while the manager was not around."
7128,"Rooms were smelling Smokey even so  I had a non-smoking room. Equipment like Ironing board were broken and furniture in bad shape. Needs an overhaul.  Location is good, if you want to go by train. Breakfast was decent."
7129,"Good clean rooms with a built in modern bathroom, Nice location. However we arrived on a Friday and stayed until Sunday and were worried about the stag party on our 1st floor room. Asked to move just in case but the cheaper rooms are only the 1st and 2nd floors, all were taken. The problem was not the actually well behaved party but the disco (both Fri and Sat) which is in the basement or very close by. It starts at 11 and goes to 3 or 4am If you want a quiet room do not take one on the 1st or 2nd floor. Our friend was in the 2nd and the sound was just as bad. Earplugs on the Saturday night were not sufficient, the sound was worse in the bathroom. Breakfast ok, and WIFI access good. The attached sushi restaurant is excellent and very popular."
7130,"Naomi is a manager in Hotel Alnea and is an absolute gem, she couldn't have been nicer! All the staff are so friendly, the rooms are clean and the hotel is very central.  My birthday was during my stay in the hotel, and Naomi left a postcard and memorabilia on my pillow to say happy birthday. The nicest hotel staff I've ever come across! I will be back and would definitely recommend!"
7131,"Very good hotel, in a quiet street and still in the middle of the centre of Paris. And very friendly welcome and kind staff. We had a big room, nice, new and very clean. Incl large shower and a nespresso :-). We enjoyed thebeatuifully breadfast basement, delicious and lovely.  When we return to Paris, we will sure book this hotel again."
7132,A real hidden gem just a few minutes walk from the Opera.  The very well appointed apartments are spacious and have everything needed for a few days in Paris.  Once inside  there is absolutely no traffic noise (even with the windows open) - it really is a place to chill out in comfort away from the crowds.  Numerous eateries are vary close by with many of Paris' landmarks in easy walking distance.  The staff are simply fantastic and couldn't have been more helpful.  This is definitely a place not to miss.  
7133,"Well, not quite!   Here the location is excellent, in the heart of the Ribeira district, close to all the bars, cafes and shops on the waterfront and a relatively easy (though uphill) walk into the centre. It is on a busy road and taxis often find it difficult to park nearby. This was an add on to our river cruise so when we arrived at about 10am we didn’t expect our room to be ready but there was a secure room to leave our luggage. Actual check in at 3 was fine - a bit slow but straightforward.  Our room on the third floor was ok, facing the street but we heard no noise at night, either from the street or neighbouring rooms. The room itself was a slightly odd shape which didn’t leave much space for getting round the bed, but had a huge bathroom.  There was actually less storage…"
7134,"This Hotel is what you pay for, basic! But, clean, comfortable and has a nice vibe to it. Bedroom are small but functional. I asked for extra pillows and they were delivered to the room straight away. The rooms were serviced, every day, to a high standard. Breakfast was continental, as you’d expect but there were bacon, scrambled egg and waffles also available. The bar was functional but not cost bar like, so didn’t drink here. The hotel is situated beside the U Bahn and S Bahn links which is ideal for touring the city. The red line hop on tour bus is a must and was only 10 mins walk away. There are a few bars beside the hotel and a lovely Latin restaurant/ bar across from it which is worth a visit, I can recommend the fajitas 😋. So overall the hotel is cheap, cheerful, in a…"
7135,"Breakfasts tasty but boring. Near the metro station is an advantage. Rooms quite spacious.  The bathroom could be newer.  The view from the room was bad. Generally, we are satisfied with the stay. The hotel is worth visiting."
7136,"Very fast and easy check in and check out with no problems. We had pre-paid. Very clean and pretty and unique decoration. Everything seemed new and our room was left spotless everyday. It was very quiet - couldn't even tell there were other guests round us. Big bathroom, and big bedroom.  We paid for breakfast buffet on one day which was €19 each but there was a massive selection of food and it was all delicious and was good quality.  Reasonable price for a five day stay. The underground station is right outside and the bus stop is a two minute walk away. The staff were friendly and spoke English. The room looked exactly like the pictures on the website, honestly loved our stay here and would recommend to others. "
7137,The apartment was pricey but the location was stellar so we were willing to pay it. There was no AC and it was hot in there. The walls were grimy and dirty but the kitchen and bathroom and floors were clean. We got infant beds but they didn't have all the parts to make them safe to sleep in so we had to improvise a bit. Our unit was on the entry level floor and it was pretty loud when people were coming in and out. Out TV had Netflix which was a nice bonus!
7138,"Best location in Berlin. Right beside bustling Savignyplatz which is full of bars, restaurants and interesting stores. Great breakfast. Good service from Reception if a little over assertive. Room was very basic, too basic for my taste. Air conditioning seemed to be switched back to very cold temperatures constantly by the cleaning staff. Very dusty room, caused lots of sneezing. If possible, ask for a room on the side away from the train track although the noise did not interrupt my sleep."
7139,"Excellent location in the heart of Berlin, right next to KaDeWe. The perfect place to stay for a short break. Rooms very clean. A small problem is the lack of a wardrobe, which is a hindrance to a longer stay. Rooms are not very big,  but enugh for two people. Nice and very helpful staff (greetings to Attilla). Alll the hotel is non-smoking area, which is also a plus. Breakfasts - quite rich, but very ""German"". I missed some vegetables and something warm (like scrambled eggs or even sausages). Value for money in this Berlin district very good. I will definitely  use the offer of this hotel and the network again."
7141,"My wife and I visited some old friends, who live in Cannes, and we stayed at the Hotel Victoria. Very good small hotel, updated recently, and with nice rooms. it has a good ( and warm) swimming pool and parking for 19 cars. it's in a good location on the Rue d'Antibes, on one side, and only 100 yards from the sea front."
7142,About 4-5 years ago I stayed at this hotel and I was not impressed the hotel was in desperate need of renovation fast forward a few years and that's exactly what happened so I was excited to revisit the hotel see what it look like unfortunately I was let down once again first of all they seem to be understaffed during there Peak check in and check out times everywhere from the bellman at the front door to the front desk staff. I had a couple packages delivered to the hotel prior to my arrival and I am not exaggerating at all when I say that I had to call and go down to the front desk 4 times and it took a total of 7 hours for them to locate the packages and bring them to my room in addition to that one of the packages it appears that they took upon themselves to return to the…
7145," Nice position on Copacabana Beach. A nice view from to top floor. But, in the same time, a terrible noise in the rooms with inside view. Really annoying! If a like to have a quiet room maybe is better to look for another hotel!"
7146,"The breakfast is good , i had a really disrespectful approach from security service and the service room stained 3 shirts. I emailed the hotel and got a 'sorry' as an answer. At the night hotel turns into a oven, couldn't sleep 1 night of 10 i spent without woke up at midnight sweating. "
7147,"Very nice, comfortable hotel.  Felt very similar to Melia property in Madrid...  woven floor mats instead of carpet.  Clean, big, room.  Very comfortable bed.  Quiet.  Solid wifi.  My only complaint - no source of hot water/coffee in the room.  Nice place to start a night out in Berlin.  Wandered quite a ways for dinner and then meandered back along the north bank of the Spree back to the hotel.  Scenic, wonderful.  Easy Uber to Tegel in the morning."
7148,"Small and personal enough to fulfil the text book description of ""Romantic Parisian Hideaway""; large enough to amply satisfy the seasoned traveler with your 'traditional' hotel services.  Discovered just over a year ago; my family and I have visited twice and counting......"
7149,Bad customer care and way below the Ritz and Marriott standards. The hotel staff in general needs serious enhancement for their attitudes towards their guests. Taking the guests needs seriously in consideration is condition to minimum quality in customer care.
7150,"We stayed at the Iliada hotel from 13/08-27/08/13. We received a warm welcome and felt 'at home' throughout our holiday. Breakfast and air conditioning was provided as complimentary which was an extra bonus.   Our room was basic but comfortable. The fridge door in our room had seen better days and the door did not close properly but it did the job. Our room had a balcony with steps straight down to the pool which was lovely. The pool was clean as was the surrounding areas.   If you want beautiful views overlooking the caldera this is not the hotel for you as it is on the 'flat' side of Santorini.  If you like being close to the beaches, however, then this hotel is a few minutes walk from Perissa beach. Along the beach front there is a good selection of taverns which are much…"
7151,Stayed here for 3 nights while we visited Barcelona for a football match. The rooms are nice and clean and have good showers. The overall cleanliness is good the staff at reception are very polite and helpful. The sleep quality is good and there are always taxis outside . The rooms are like a bit of a maze to find. The views from breakfast are nice from the 24th flloor over looking the city. Happy overall with this hotel restaurant was decent too
7152,"Garden room was a misnomer, it overlooked a public park where the old men gather to play a noisy argumentative game of cards each afternoon, stray dogs roam and the homeless wander and urinate. At night, you could here the noisy local restaurants until  2 am and then they came out to recycle their glass in the bins right outside. Room was spacious but seriously short of charging sockets, so take a USB multi-charger WIFI downstairs was free; a strong signal but you had to pay for it in your room. Breakfast was a good hot and cold buffet and although we were so disappointed with our first meal that we ate out for the next few days, especially the A Muralha, next door. On the last two nights we were so stuffed that we went back to eating in the hotel, where we could control the…"
7153,"This hotel is far to expected standards.  Breakfast buffet first morning was running out of orange juice.  The bar is running out of beers, draft or bottles, after 7 pm and 2 days in the row.  Check out took 20 minutes because lack of preparation and concern about customer’s precious time.  Calling a taxi took them 10 minutes.  Happy to be out of here and will never be back.  There are much better hotels in the area.  Shameful to call that place Hilton! "
7154,"Had reservations 3 months in advance for my wedding night, get there they gave away my nice room and DOWNGRADED me to a smaller bed, next morning got a new room with a fridge that had moldy food in it"
7155,"Warning: They advertise a shuttle from the International terminal, which is the reason I decided to stay there after a late evening International arrival. What they don’t tell you is that they only have what appears to be “a” shuttle, first come first served. Arriving around 10p last Friday I was told anywhere up to an hour wait. I was told even though I am handicapped and have difficulty walking, tough, you wait.  I would therefore rate them unacceptable if you are handicapped."
7157,"This was our first time in Cannes and we booked the classic double room here which was spacious and light, the room decor is one of the reasons this hotel stands out from the rest - very minimalist and modern, and the room was absolutely spotless! The view from the room wasn’t the best but the location is excellent, a stones throw from the railway station and close to shops and the Croisette. Every room has a balcony or balconette and has a smart tv, and the beds are super comfy. The staff are always very polite, smiley and happy to help, and they were able to leave our luggage with them after we had checked out on the day of our flight free of charge. Even though we left rather late in the mornings our room was always cleaned when we returned, and although we didn’t book…"
7158,"Sheraton Retiro is not a good place to stay. Half of the rooms are really old, smelly and have dirty carpets. The location is good during the day cause your near downtown but its really dangerous if you want to go out at night."
7159,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here - such a good location near all the Gaudi buildings and shopping.  The rooms are good  (if a bit small, but you are in Europe), service is great and we really couldn't ask for more.  We'd definitely stay here again."
7160,"The place was clean and offered good opportunities to meet other people. Decent breakfast for $8 Euro. The down side- the bed was awful very thin mattress causing a sore back every morning, thin lumpy pillows and the bathroom ""wet room"" was super impractical as everything got wet and had a weird smell that wouldn't go away. Nice hostel but would not stay again as the sleeping conditions were terrible. OK if only staying one night."
7161,"Stayed here in early December 2018 with my wife and Adult daughter to visit the Berlin christmas markets.   Excellent hotel, clean, tidy and warm. Room was comfortable for 3 people, Not too much road noise and easy access to the Berlin metro system.  Didn't eat in the hotel so cannot comment on that aspect.   Nice little bar.   All in all excellent. Booked with Easyjet as part of a Flight+Hotel package. Would book again"
7162," When I checked into the room I noticed the room was not properly cleaned (i.e short black hairs in the shower, water stains on the sink).   The worst part was the service where the staff was mostly trained to cater to ""white"" foreigners. Examples : when I queued for the breakfast buffet line, the white lady behind me got the the front desk persons attention first even though I was in front of her. Then the staff had a nerve to verify my room number I put in the list.  When I sat down, I noticed all the waitresses got drinks for the white customers, while no one came to ask me what I wanted to drink. When my white colleague came to sat down, finally the waitress came and asked him what he wanted while ignoring me.   I was annoyed by the service and told the manager I was not…"
7163,"Clean, professional, and safe hotel. Really made my time in Paris that much better. Close to the center of Paris so everything is accessible on foot or with a short cab ride. All staff understand varying levels of English which made check-in and check-out a breeze. "
7165,I felt Marlon Brando when going through the steps of the escalator. Or Clark Gable... seriously speaking very good hôtel worth stopping in. Will come back with family definitely. Good beer served on the bar.
7166,"This is a perfectly OK hotel.  Think a tired IBIS or Holiday Inn Express and you get the idea.  However, they are charging a rate that means the hotel is not at all good value.  As for the price for the internet, the hotel seems to want to part you from every little bit of cash you have.  It is daylight robbery.  Check in was ok, although not overly friendly.  That and the intimidating security staff add to a feeling that you are being watched at every moment.  As for the room.  Decent sized, cheap laminate on the floor and a perfectly comfortable bed.  It was however, basic.  Bathroom was tired and very dated.  Was fun trying to get the shower to the right temperature as there was an unmovable screen so you were soaked trying to push the button to make the water run to the bath…"
7167,"We stayed here for 5 nights and it offered us a good base. The hotel itself was clean and the staff were nice. Breakfast got a bit overcrowded and was your typical continental breakfast, although the cooked options werent amazing thr pastries and fresh fruit were lovely. We ate in the hotels resturant on the first night as we were tired and to be totally honest weren't amazed, there were no major issues but it certainly wasnt as good as other places we ate at whilst in the city. That said, our room was lovely and the air con worked a treat, the sheets and bedding was changed daily which was a good touch too. Downsides are the walls are very thin...we had to make noise complaints on 2 separate occasions and whenever someone walked down the corridors or spoke in their room at a…"
7168,"I cannot praise this hotel enough. It was such a nice experience.    We arrived rather late and the key was left for us at the reception. It's located in a very quiet neighborhood with plenty space to park. Each room is unique and we got one of the smalls. But for 2 nights, it was no problem at all!   The hotel is nicely decorated and I can tell there is a lot of heart pouring into this place.  It's kept neatly and nicely. Room equipped with hair dryer, shampoo, soap, shower cap, and TV.  For 10 minutes walk down the hill, you will be in the city which is nice because you avoid all the fuss finding parking and driving in the center. Otherwise, I think there is a bus passing.   The highlight is probably the owner or the carer of the hotel. She is the nicest lady. She welcomed us…"
7171,"Very comfortable hotel to stay in. Does the job. Very nice location being in the Rambla (if you don’t mind the business, which you don’t ever notice while inside the hotel) close to plaza de Catalunya which is where all main transport meeting points are. Muffins in the buffet breakfast are the best you will ever taste. Make sure you have that if you decide to stay here."
7172,"A-train is very close to Central Station and main tourist area. Cheking in and out is pretty fast, just pay and go. Service was polite and swift. I stayed in a single-room which was tiny and bed felt like a coffin. There were steps after the door which  could make it difficult to move about with heavy luggage. Bathroom was clean and with all necessary things. There is a breakfast room next to the lobby but it was not included in my room price. Anyway lots of places to eat nearby. Room felt a bit expensive but Amsterdam is an expensive city and hotel is very centrally locates. Okay for one night stay."
7173,"It's an expensive hotel for the service they provide. We run into two very unpolite personal staff, who had a really good attitude.The installations are from good to poor, but as it is a ""deluxe room"" we were expecting another kind of room. The description of the room didn't match at all with the reality.Wouldn't come back."
7174,"Great location 3 minutes from the old “historic” area. 10 minutes walk from Alexandar Plts. . Very friendly staff . Our first room was very small and not very clean. It overlooked the back court yard. Our friends had a larger room overlooking the main road and our request to move to a similar room was arranged. Both rooms set up for guests with mobility issues, not requested.  Large shower room with no bath. Other rooms could have different arrangements. We did not eat in the hotel as there better ( and more reasonably priced) 5 - 10 minutes walk."
7175,"I have to admit that at first I was disappointed.  I walked from Alexanderplatz to the hotel, which was a desolate walk which made the hotel seem remote.  On arrival I was given a room that was plenty spacious but the windows all looked out at what would generously be called a courtyard but was more in the nature of a 25' air shaft.  But the place really did grow on me. First, the neighborhood gets much better just west of the hotel, with lots of great restaurants (particularly on Kollwitzstrasse) and shops (including an organic grocery store just down the street from the hotel with a decent bakery). My guess is that for most guests, the trade off of having a quiet room on the interior makes up for not having sunlight or a view of the street.  If you are in search of quiet, the…"
7176,I arrive before official check in time. But reception was hapy to announce my room was already available.. Room 11 15. Entering I thought the bed to be small for someone of my length (1m86) .. I had to sleep diagonally to fit in the bed. Also the sink hardly higher than my knees... this room was for people of 1m60 or people in wheelchair. The reception told me other rooms were like this as well..Housekeepers told me there were rooms with sinkgs at normal height. Recepction told me there was no availablity for other rooms. So after 5 days sleeping diagonally and wondering on the low sink-height...I checked out.. The guy at the reception gave me the bill and said: the bill is actually lower than on your reseveration.. once again to make me feel happy. But all in all it feels that…
7177,"One person can totally destroy the whole impression of the hotel. While the room was OK, the reception desk was just terrible. Front manager NORA was the least cooperative receptionists I have ever seen. While I was trying to check out fast she was intentionally slow and arrogant. I have kindly informed Nora that I am in a harry to the airoport, she ignored my request and continued to explain the system to the other employee. All that doubled the required time for check out. In a very similar arrogant manner she ignored my request to provide a total bill including the deposit or send the recept via email."
7178,Staff where beyond rude.The rooftop “pool” is open to the public for a purchase of a day pass. The main reason I booked the hotel was to use this facility and that wasn’t possible as the pool was grossly overcrowded and there was no where to sit 
7179,"Although the room was small (which was expected), the hotel made up for it with friendly staff (especially Patrick, who was really helpful) and amazing location. Just a short walk to the Louvre or Opera Garnier meant we had lots of food options at our doorstep. The room was very clean and well maintained, bed was comfortable and bathroom was modern."
7180,"* Lovely boutique hotel * Staff are friendly, in particular Cathy at Reception. If you need a restaurant, ask her for a recommendation.  We tried the 3 she recommended and they were all super. * Rooms are a bit small, but comfortable, and extremely clean.  * Bathrooms recently renovated, therefore modern and clean. * Housekeeping staff do a great job and there cleaning is consistent. No surprises from day to day. * Transport very easy from the hotel and in Paris in particular. Bus available metres from the hotel. * Breakfast is simple, but more than adequate."
7181,"From the start, this hotel was a disappointing experience. The internet (in the lobby and our rooms) did not work and our rooms were not ready until 7:30PM. We were a group of 12 and they split our rooms on different floors of the hotel. But that's not the worst part. At 1am on our second night, someone unlocked the door and 3 burly men walked into our room WITHOUT KNOCKING because someone on the floor below us reported that there was a leak in their ceiling. The men proceeded to walk into our bathroom (that has no lock mind you) and check the shower--which had been recently used. He then interrogated us on why there was a leak assuming that we were guilty of poking holes in the floor or something? On their way out, one of them said ""I like you guys, you're much quieter than…"
7182,"This hotel was conveniently situated to the EuroMedLab 2019 congress convention centre. Check-in was excellently handled. The room I had was comfortable and clean. The shower door did not close properly and therefore the floor outside the shower would get wet. The toilet closet was very small and cramped. The fridge was stocked with mineral water, Coca Cola, a bottle is Estrella beer, and Royal Bliss lemon juice. This is free of charged and restocked on a daily basis. Breakfast in the first floor restaurant was good with a reasonable selection of cooked breakfast and cold cuts with a selection of cheeses, and fruit. I did not use the gym or Swimming pools. I had a problem with my TV and they brought me a new TV the next day but I seemed to have lost the news channels in English…"
7183,"Conveniently located, this wonderful hotel welcomed us with much comfort. Clean rooms and a plush bed ensured that we would start the next day with much energy. We truly enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again. "
7184,"I wasn't happy with my stay. Firstly, I was given a room with a disability bathroom, which makes it tremendously difficult for me in the shower since I'm of average height. I was not informed of this when I checked in, and I only found out once I started showering. Secondly, since my room is attached to another room, the door is very thin and I could hear the guests next door talking until late at night. That again is unacceptable as this is a business trip for me and I specifically requested a quiet room. Thirdly, I requested slippers from housekeeping staff but to no avail. I didn't get a response that slippers are unavailable, the lady on the other end of the line merely stated she'll send someone with it. I gave up after the second try seeing I'm staying for only one night,…"
7185,"I booked a apartment room. The room was on two floors, very dark (just a small window) and stale smelly. The badroom was very small. Far too small for this room class. We asked for another room after the first uncomfortable night. Of course only smaller rooms (lower class) were available. The new room was little more comfortable and had a bigger badroom and better light and air condition. But thin walls/doors and the old fashioned interieur didn't make it much better. Breakfast was terrible! They served unfresh food (fruits, cakes, ...). After we found out that all butter and honey portions were expired we informend the kitchen staff. Thus they removed the expiring date from each single portion and put it back the next day. This is BAD! The hotel used to be great many years ago.…"
7187,"I checked in the  hotel on the 10th This  Month  at  around 3;15  the   gentleman at the  Reception was Nice , up to standard  BUT THE REST  of  my time there  were  Horrible !!  First , when we  wanted  to book  dinner  at the  hotel 's Rest.,  the  staff  , Pedro , was  Not  kind  and  impolite  and told us  in a  Not nice  way that they could not  give  us  table   earlier as  they Have  a  Guest GROUP  to serve , we Begged him that we  have oly 2  persons .....  but  then ......  answer was  still NO  !! 2-  when we  wanted  to ask Info.,  about  a  Nice  Rest.,  nearby hotel or  not far away , the  CONCIERGE  around 50ish --60  years old  tole  us  in an arrogant way  that  he was  not  sure   and  not Helpful at all !! 3-i called  the  reception  in the  evening  around …"
7188,The hotel is fairely central . However it has poor facilities . The food is below average and no varaition off a set menu. On the last night the food was cold and although they did not charge ruined what was an overpriced experience 
7189,There is a swimming pool policy that is is compulsory to wear a swimming cap to access the swimming pool. Personally I think it is troublesome since I do not usually wear a swimming cap during swimming. The experience was bad.
7190,"Above standard Ibis Hotel in a good location just down the road from the Gedächtnis Kirche. Rooms are large and quiet. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Parking is available for a resaonable price. Standard Ibis breakfast, good value."
7191,"We stayed for 4 nights. The hotel is located very close to the Pearl Tower and the Acquarium, and only about 5 minutes walk to the Lujiazui subway station. Right next to the promenade along the river. Swimming pool and gym are nice, with stunning views of the city. The service was really average to poor, disappointing for such a big name hotel. Breakfast - good choice and variety, but quality, freshness and taste were not great.   Check out - very long, queueing for 10 minutes with only 2 staff dealing with the guests. Only the lady managing the traffic downstairs, Bella, was really trying to help, was super attentive and nice. It was not what we expected for this price range."
7192,"I spent a night at this hotel as I had to catch a bus the next morning  and the hotel was reasonably priced while located a 10 min walk away from the Rede Expressos bus terminal. Decent breakfast with plenty of pasteis de nata, a traditional Portuguese sweet.       "
7193,"An overnight stay in Cannes necessitated finding a hotel near the port.   This hotel didn't disappoint.   Right in the centre of Cannes near the beaches and restaurants.   Comfortable rooms and good decor.   Friendly, helpful staff."
7194,"My experience at the Adante hotel wasn't so great, first of all the indian guy at the check in desk was rude as hell, we just asked if we could have our luggage stored and the only answer was ""your room won't be ready until 3 pm"", I had to repeat myself 4 times and insist to leave our luggage, this man couldn't be more bothered by us. That did not prevent him from trying to sell us tickets for tour buses and more. We could say that he was having a bad day and that it wasn't the right moment for us to come in apparently.   The room was extra tiny, not much space for three people, facilities aren't so clean, and the bathroom very small. The lock on the door was suspicious, so we didn't feel very safe.  Also there were customers making a lot of noise around 3 am every night, I…"
7195,"Did my booking online confirmed but when I got there could not find reservation. The rate given to me was from other hotel (2 blocks away)which had room available.....Really messy..... don't use online, call the hotel direct, that is my advise......Buenos Aiores is beautiful. "
7196,"I booked 2 rooms in May at this Westin for a family trip to Chicago in October. Today, 5 MONTHS LATER and the DAY BEFORE ARRIVAL, I was informed the hotel had overbooked by 30 ROOMS and my reservation had been cancelled. I am now scrambling to find new rooms, rearrange limo service drop off/pickup, etc. This is the WORST, and most inexplicable treatment of a traveler that  I have ever witnessed. Needless to say, I will never book with Westin again, nor will I encourage my friends or business associates to either."
7197,"The hotel is very conveniently located with bus & metro links to the city making trips to main sight very straightforward. A great neighbourhood , comfortable rooms & good breakfast.  The staff are also very helpful. The only thing missing is a fridge in the room Thankyou for a great stay "
7198,"The hotel was very clean throughout and conveniently located, they are the only good points. The rooms are very small and very basic. The breakfast consists of cold plates and cold food, along with a coffee machine that no one could operate and the staff never interested in assisting!!!"
7199,We had a spacious room for 2 adults and 2 children. Reasonable buffet breakfast. friendly and helpful front desk staff. Modern clean rooms. Walking distance to Alexanderplatz and the subway/ tram station. wifi quality was poor upstairs.Otherwise a gem.
7200,"The good? A desktop computer in every room, a block away from a subway station and a rather friendly service. The bad? Raw sewage smell emanating from the bathroom, absolutely horrible breakfast (don't touch the coffee), not very clean, very far away from the city centre.  I do have to say that the service at this hotel was really good. We asked for a different room because the first one was really too small for us (2 adults, one baby in a standard room with twin beds and a cradle) and they accommodated us right away. The staff is very friendly and courteous. That being said, it couldn't make up for its other shortcomings."
7201,"Staff were very friendly.   Room was lovely (attic room). Could walk anywhere. Would have preferred a better hotel bar.   While you could get a drink,  there wasn't a place to sit at the bar and service was not quick.   That said,  overall it was a great experience and the staff were terrific."
7202,Despite our request for a room away from the construction (as I needed to rest during the day) I have had constant air hammmer work all day today and half the day yesterday. Had to change rooms initially as my request for a 2 bed room was not followed.
7203,This is the second time we are staying at the Hotel Esprit Saint Germain and once again we were not disappointed. The service was impeccable and very attentive. The hotel offers now a portable WiFi device which is a great addition to their already over the top offering. The open bar ( from 1 pm to 2 am) and the free minibar (soft-drinks) is definitely a huge plus and makes the hotel stand out among its peers.  The rooms are spacious and clean and the location is perfect if you like the Saint Germain and Louvre/  Place Vendôme Area. We are travelling on a yearly basis to Paris and we will definitely stay at this hotel a third time.
7204,"Staff was friendly. Room was awful. Nothing like the pictures, small, t.v. was 20  inches at most. all the square footage was in the bathroom. Turned on the shower and water started spraying everywhere, ceiling out of the shower. the bed was hard. As for a roof top garden.... it's a roof top with nice tables and a few planted boxes with flowers. Not a garden by any stretch. "
7205,"I stayed there for a week, it’s a nice place with personnel really kind and helpful in every kind of situation. Quiet place in spite of the neighborhood at 15 km (10 miles). I passed out of the hotel the major part of my time, my personal opinion: Is an excellent choice if you need a place where sleep only, because the hotel is perfect with quality-price. "
7208,"Reception was not friendly. Asked for a queen/double bed, got a single. The TV had problems, channels were changing automatically every 5 minutes. The incredibly loud noise from a drilling machine was on all afternoon. What can I say.... stressful!"
7209,"After paying close to $500 a night, I was expecting something a little nicer. When I arrived, I had to pay an additional unexpected amenities fee of $25 per night for access to the gym next door, coffee in the morning, and a wine hour in the evening (set time in the evening, so if you miss it, tough luck). There was no coffee maker in the room. The room was tiny. I estimate less than a 200 sq foot space. There was random hairs all over the place. I found hair on the tattered, dirty desk chair, on the head board, on the hair dryer bag, on the bathroom floor, on the comforter, near the base of the mattress and even a pubic hair in the bathroom. This of course made me cautious over everything in the room, so I carefully peeled back the comforter to make sure there was no hair on…"
7211,"I found this hotel very neutral indeed. The views are really spectacular wherever you happen to be looking at on this extraordinary island. Anyway this is not the reason i write this review. There is something really strange i read on the previous review on your site about Alexanders hotel. The person who writes the review tells us he visited Oia in January and that he visited a huge variety of restaurants, bars and shops. I dont want your readers to be deceived. In Oia in the winter you can hardly find a cup of coffee. Everything is closed and that is the reason i always visit at this time of year. I like it when it is perfectly quiet. Even the cats know that. Maybe the person who wrote the review made a mistake about the time of their visit."
7212,"I have been staying at Mercure hotels in Brazil since 2001.  I had always considered them to be a good value proposition for business travelers.  Over the past several years, I have perceived a notable drop off in service and a deterioration of Infraestructure.    This downward trend hit a new (and below minimal acceptable standards) during my most recent visit to Mercure Rio Vermelho in Salvador.    Poor and confusing service at reception upon arrival.  WIFI that did not immediately work; it took the 30 min to sort it out.    My room was in very poor condition and in desperate need of basic maintanence and refurbishing/upgrade.  I must have had the worst room in the hotel: on the first floor overlooking a dreary rock garden and com create wall.  The only positive aspect of the…"
7213,"Just stayed at this hotel during Art Week in Miami and feel very differently about it than most reviewers. I booked this hotel last February, based Tripadvisor reveiws so I feel compelled to share a different perspective:  My biggest beef was that because I booked and paid direct (non refundable) through an ancillary website (Booking.com) and did not have the original the original card (cancelled due to fradulent activity), I was charged AGAIN for the full amount (#severalthousanddollars) at check in. At the time, I thought no big deal, a credit will be issued. Well, here I am almost nine days later, and the credit still has not posted to my American Express. Incredible!  When I called yesterday to inquire, I got the run around. I was frustrated and asked for the manager who was…"
7214,"My wife and I chose this hotel for our five night stay in Paris, based in large part, on these reviews and I'm glad we did.  Our room was great and very comfortable.  While all of the staff were wonderful and very helpful, I'd like to give a special nod to Thomas, who worked at the front desk.  Thomas gave us advice, directions and answered any questions we had.  While only having worked there a short time, Thomas is a definite asset to this hotel. We were a short walk to the Oberkampf Metro station as well as a grocery store, restaurants and drug stores.  We would stay here again and recommend this hotel."
7215,"Stayed 25th to 28th Nov for a few days in the sun to escape the british winter.  Not a plush hotel but perfect for our needs.  Clean, comfortable and in a fairly good location.  Not for anyone who doesn't like a bit of a walk though.  Plenty of nice eating places nearby and THE nicest coffee shop is just on the doorstep.  Would stay here again if visiting Madeira.  A jeep trip is a must to see some of the island !!"
7216,"First time in San Francisco booked this motel months before Hand after travelling 15 hour flight, we first noticed building didn’t look like the photos we had seen when booking, checked in staff was friendly when we opened the door to the foyer the smell was so overwhelming we had to cover our noses, the most awful mould smell. Walked three flights of stairs with all our luggage, entered room, it was so small again nothing like the photos we had seen, the window was on the Main Street could not open window to cool room as it was so noisey off traffic, could also not sleep from noise of traffic and people yelling all night long. The shower was impossible to regulate temperature your either burning or freezing cold, could not believe there was no refrigerator in room, could not…"
7217,"Excellent location, nice private inner court, friendly and helpful staff are always among constant advantages of this hotel. The renovated interior looks fresh, although the previous one was cosy and charming.  Adding a minibar, a safety box, and hooks for coats in the room would be highly appreciated. Probably, the ac would also be needed within a hot summer."
7218,"Good location, nice pool, good breakfast, eggs ,ham fresh bread and cereals plus fruit. We were supposed to be in a sea view studio but was put on floor 7 . Bathroom awful and first day we had to get a new shower head. Kitchen basic not enough utensils and only 2 huge pans with no kettle. It says rooms had been updated but ours was definitely not. I would say this is a 2 to 3 star hotel. If we had not planned to be out hiking everyday we would have asked to change our room. Would I stay here again?   Maybe if they updated their rooms.  All the staff were very pleasant."
7220,Located in a strategic and accessible to public transportation with eating places around plus supermarket. Accommodating staffs and welcoming. I had a nice stay for 4 nights and quite reasonable for the price.
7221,We had stunning views and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  Rooms were decorated wonderfully and breakfast was served to our room.   We did have to travel to black beach to enjoy the water.  We had a great time
7222,"We stayed here at Christmas. Hotel is a cozy, hipster hotel at Uhlandstrasse, near of Ku’damm. Excellent and friendly service, clean and nicely decorated room. We booked little bigger room and there was enough space for two and stuff. Windows were good enough and noices from street did not disturb at all. Doors, however, don’t have any sound proofing, so all voices can be hear from corridor. The bed was extremely comfortable.   Breakfast was served at Benedict restaurant downstairs. It was always full and it was difficult to find a table if you come after 9.30. Breakfast was served on table, several egg-made options with coffee and water. Juice cost extra. Service was not very good and rather chaotic.  Restaurant, however, is not exactly a part of hotel, so you can eat breakfast…"
7223,We are staying here at the moment. And I have to say the hotel is immaculately clean  It is a little understaffed however the staff are all pleasant. I cannot comment on the food here as we haven't eaten at the hotel.  I would certainly recommend it as an inexpensive getaway in winter.  I have stayed in a lot worse that cost a lot more. The 1 big negative however is the beach. It's terrible. (Dirty)
7224,"After we left the hotel they charge my credit card to additional 300 usd, after I call to them, they say that don't find bathropes in the room. We ever did not see this bathropes in the room, but hotel refused to discuss this situation. Several times I tried to talk to manager, bud every time he was busy or out.  I advise every body not to take this hotel"
7225,"Our family of five (myself, my wife, and our three daughters) had booked a room as part of a block of guests for my wife's cousin's wedding on Saturday, onsite at the St. Regis hotel scheduled for 6:00 pm.  I confirmed that we'd receive a double bed room in a few days ahead of our arrival, which was the same afternoon of the wedding.  I called at 2:00pm that afternoon, an hour before the official check-in time of 3:00pm and the front desk told me they were finishing up our room, took down my cell phone number, and would call me when it was ready.  We arrived around 2:30pm, stepped up to the counter to check-in at 2:50pm and our room was still not ready.  OK, we thought perhaps a few more minutes ... which ticked away, and away, and away!  My wife went back and asked for our room…"
7226,Awesome reception/lving room/entertainment area! More of the industrial modern design and super love the look and feel of this hotel! The gym looks fancy:)  Near a mall and lots of restaurant choices in the area. We'd absolutely stay here again!
7227,"The hotel was in a fantastic location, just a 2 minute walk from the Madeliene Cathedral and metro - a 10 minute journey to the Eiffel.   The hotel staff were amazing - extremely accommodating and friendly. Will defo recommend this hotel and head back on my next trip!"
7228,"The staff here are all extremely helpful and very kind. But the location of the hotel is a 9-12 minute drive from Nha Trang's more popular areas. Although hiring a scooter was really fun for this problem.   The laundry service at the hotel is very expensive, after the morning there was practically no hot water in the shower, the shower not being very powerful either. The bathroom has no power plugs and the WiFi was terrible: disconnecting and inconsistent. We had a great taxi driver take us to the airport upon leaving but they gave us mouldy bread in the breakfast box one can order for early check out. Otherwise their normal free breakfast service in house is nice.  Just FYI, the pool's most shallow end is 1.6 meters deep and it apparently closes at 6pm with no lights for any…"
7229,"The hotel was TERRIBLE.  I would NOT recommend staying there.  It's cheap for a few reasons.  Yes, it's decorated nice and bright; but it's just a cheap veneer.  The quality of materials they used in the remodel is very low.  I got bit by bed bugs; BAD.  It was quite the fun process to return from vacation only to have to sanitze everything we brought with us.  It is also in what Lonely Planet calls ""Skid Row""  If you stay here, DO NOT plan on taking the BART.  The walk from the hotel to the station is really bad; I live downtown in a big city, so I know bad when I see it.  In our two days we saw numerous drug deals go down.  After braving the night time walk from the BART (and seeing someone being arrested), we had been in the room less then 10 minutes, when a manager came up,…"
7230,"I try to keep it short and simple:  I´m not Mr. Proper but I have to say our room was dirty. There have been a lot of shaved hair on the toilet, long black hair on the floor in the bathroom. In the small fridge was mold which you saw directly when you opened it. There was dust everywhere...on the headboard, on the lamp on the TV...and not just a little bit. I don´t have that much after half a year.  Ok...I was nice and told them 3 times that it´s dirty, and I got a message ""Hello! Thank you so much for the feedback. I will follow up with our housekeeping teamd regarding your comments and pictures. Can I have someone come up and clean the room for you today?"" They cleaned the headboard and the bathroom. But the lamps where stil complete dusty and the mold was still in the fridge.…"
7231,"A short walk from Potsdammer Plaz brings you to NH hotel. It is modern fresh and comfortable. Well placed for Berlin Wall exploring or heading to  the Ku Damm fir shopping. Great helpful staff,all speak good English, highly recommended for short breaks."
7232,"Overall the hotel was very nice. The location was very convenient, the service was perfect, the rooms were not big but elegantly decorated and very clean! But please do not ask for the basic room! We spent the first night in a room on the 1st floor, which had no direct access to either of the building's facades!! With no natural light, one gets a very claustrophobic feeling. I wonder how the local regulations allow such a thing! Next day we've been upgraded to a 5th floor standard room overlooking the street (with an extra charge of 25€/day) and we enjoyed another 3 days of pure Barcelona fun!"
7234,We travelled as a family of 5 and booked into 3 rooms. The first night was a little disappointing my husband I got room 1 but was extremely noisy during the first night. (little sad because the room was huge). We asked the manager to move us and he immediately organised it. That was the only issue we had - the hotel rooms are a little smaller than what South Africans are used to but it was a perfect size and had everything we needed. Rooms come with on suite bathroom and they are a really good size. We engaged a lot with the front staff and found them extremely helpful with everything we needed. The breakfast was enjoyable - not a normal English breakfast but a breakfast with a Parisian twist.
7235,"Cleanliness was a disaster, we never saw such a filthy bathroom, mold everywhere;  The room service tray and the breakfast silverware were very dirty;  The bed is not comfortable, low quality of sheets and towels;  Promptly at 6:30 AM -  planes arrive at Congonhas Airport, there is no noise protection on the windows = wake up time.  Good location for shopping , restaurants and theaters, but honestly, I don't believe it is worth it!"
7237,"We enjoyed our stay in SSAW hotel and stayed there 4 nights. The rooms were nice and clean, the breakfast on the beautiful terrace excelent with various choices. All the time we used yellow taxi called by receptionist for a good price to travel different locations of the city. I am very very sorry we left the hotel with purple/red taxi once again called by receptionsit for the Pudong AirPort. I do not understand way do they call us different taxi service, We belived them that it will be Ok while they write in their advertising materials to be helpful not only with taxi rates. We had to pay 261 yuans instead of 180 yuans!!! I could not believe that hotel receptionist could call us such a tief taxi!!! I think it is neccassarry to make trust relationship between guasts and personal!"
7238,"My nephew and I loved this hotel for a three night stay. The lobby has a great feel and it actually made us late to dinner once or twice because we were comfortably hanging out with a drink and relaxing before dinner. The room was really nice and clean, probably average size. The breakfast was included in our price, and provided a small buffet and ability to order from the menu. We were not able to make it too much of the music concerts that they offer, but it is a nice little addition that they do. I might suggest that they provide a wider variety of times, because we found that there was a lot of conflict with dinner plans. All of the service was perfect, with really nice young people providing everything that we needed. We really love the neighborhood in which the hotel sits,…"
7239,"A very comfortable hotel with a cosy atmosphere. Central location. Excellent experience right from the booking, pre-arrival questionnaire, to the reception and the stay itself. Very friendly and professional staff as well as owners. Will certainly return to this hotel which is highly recommended."
7240,"This has been our 7th stay in the Lyric-Hotel and it has been just perfect all the time. We always felt like home, because the staff has always been absolutely professional. But in the same way they were also treating us as we were part of their family. The rooms and the hotel in general was always clean and in a perfect condition. For us it's just the best Hotel in town with the best staff in the whole world! "
7241,"We arrived late afternoon, our luggage taken 'below' awaiting check-in, while we proceeded to the reception area. There were already two people checking in, so we stood in the small hallway, where people were standing around chatting. I'm sure the experience is not to feel rushed, and it wasn't, which some people like. I'd rather skip sniffing the tray of 4 scent choices for turn-down service and get to the room. We stayed in a loft/suite, which took some getting to. The Waldorf apparently acquired property built in the 1600's, refurbished it and opened about a year ago (seems like they combined 2 buildings). The hotel is not surprisingly, decorated beautifully. The staff showing us to our room notified us it was a non-smoking hotel-we don't smoke, no problem. She then asked if…"
7243,"This is a hard hotel to love - but it's a hotel you can like easily.  My wife was running a conference here, and so we stayed a couple of extra days beyond to avoid moving.  The rates vary a lot -- and she managed to get a better rate on line than having her office arrange it -- so it's either her office, or weird pricing.  The breakfast is absolutely not worth it -- it's fine if you're staying there for a conference and you want to eat and meet at the same place, but it's pricey, and pretty meh.  The rooms are nice, and the location, while not top Berlin is well situated.  Close to the Tiergarten, and the museum quarter, so it's quite walkable, even though the maps would suggest other wise."
7244,"I basically live in hotels, and I don't leave a lot of reviews, but this was so overpriced that I have to do this.  This is a Motel that has been fixed up a bit.  Most rooms face in, so there is NOOOO privacy outside the window, effectively making the rooms have no windows.  Still has that Motel smell, and mildew all over the bathrooms.  This is offensively overpriced for what you get.  Staff is rude, beds are uncomfortable, and there's only one elevator, so don't be in a hurry when trying to get into or out of this place."
7245,"My Husband and I spent a couple of night here for our annual visit to Germany for the Christmas Markets (which this hotel is ideally located for, just a few minute walk to the market with U-Bahn access to get to the rest of this wonderful city and a little further to the next one by the Rathaus. We had a lovely warm welcome and much to our delight our room was ready and this was before 10:00! Amazing what a great start.   Our room was lovely, yes it’s small but it’s a city and all we needed! I loved how it was decorated!    Lovely little bar and we had a few drinks here before bed after our hours out and about in the city.  We can’t fault this hotel at all and we have already recommended it to many people and will certainly use it again when we return to Berlin.  Thank you for a…"
7246,"We got there and the room we had was 8th floor and has metal mesh on the Windows so you can't get a view and feel enclosed and wasn't the room I paid for.  Also not worth the 511 euros for 2 nights.  Room decor is basic, mattresses are hard.  "
7250,"I stayed at the Beacon in August 2017 for 3 nights. The first night I stayed there I was awaken by demolition noise coming from the adjacent building. I notified management and they were able to move me to another room which didn't make things better. The manager also failed to mitigate the value of my first night's stay due to the inconvenience. Management failed to lower its price under the circumstances and failed to inform me of the annoyance upon check-in. Also, the hotel had a terrible old and moldy stench which the manager (full of excuses) informed me that they had a new cleaning service that is not up to par. The Beacon should be a two star hotel at its best and I advise anyone to avoid this hotel because it's not worth the price to be awaken at 6am by heavy duty…"
7251,"If you are prepared to pay the extra for lounge access at Hilton Waikiki Beach,be prepared for plastic cutlery. It is the only hotel private lounge I know that expects guests to clear their own table, return and clear the crockery . When I requested for a knife to eat my breakfast with because the plastic ones can't cut,I was given a short butter knife. If you want breakfast,make sure you are at the lounge before 8.30am.    Even though 9 am is the advertised time for breakfast to finish, the abundant amount of food is removed before 9am. A number of guests I noticed went without the breakfast they paid for.  By 9.15 am, the vacuum cleaner comes out. I get the impression that the breakfast staff is in a hurry to go home and take the surplus food with them. When I requested for a…"
7252,"I met my husband on the coast while he was traveling for business.  I usually do all of  the planning,, but I told him I didn't have time so he booked a room at The Inn at Avila Beach.  I'll start with the positives:  first of all, staff seemed friendly and it appeared that they made a genuine effort to make our stay pleasant.  The location is lovely--Right across the street from a beautiful, quiet beach and pier.  It is clear that they are doing some remodeling, but that was okay with us.  When we checked in, the gentleman was very nice, no oceanfront rooms available but we decided to upgrade to a spa room--my husband went downstairs to check in, and we even talked of possibly staying another night because we love the area do much.  At about 9:30 that night, the man that we…"
7253,This hotel is located 4 minutes from central station in Amsterdam. The price we paid was 104 Euro per night but this price did not include breakfast. It was great that there was free parking as parking in the city is scarce and expensive. The bed was good but did not have a mattress protector. There is a room safe but its not attached to anything and therefor makes it easy for anyone with room access to walk away with it. Location is in a bit of shady area . To get to our room we had to open at least 6 doors in the hall ways which is a bit odd
7254,"We decided on this hotel because it had an Ice Bar. The location is Monmartre, however, the location of the hotel is up a small side road. The area here is somewhat run down. It is just a 5 minute walk to La Chapelle Metro station which is ideal to getting to the Arc de Triomphe etc. Better to purchase a 2/3 day ticket. Our room (207) was amazing. We were lucky enough to be upgraded. The bed was huge with lovely pillows. A lovely waterfall shower, luxury shampoos etc. An expresso coffee machine, no milk though and small disposable cups.A TV with options to watch films. There were magazines and a local map. We looked out over the reception area. There was even a magazine to read in the loo. The coat hangers were also wacky. The reception area, which is a glass Cube(Kube) is surrounded by old cars, bikes made into seats, old bicycles and even a cable car. Breakfast was included, which was typical continental, however you can have eggs cooked to your liking. We ate in the restaurant/bar on our first night. The menu was in English which helped, as we were trying to translate the french copy earlier. Starters 11 euros, mains 21 euros and desserts 9 euros. Food was served hot and well presented. Excellent quality. The bar doesn't open until 7pm, however, you can get a beer beforehand. We were given a complimentary cocktail which was very tasty. The Cocktail Barman was very entertaining. Good selection of wines with the lowest priced at 24 euros. All the staff were very helpful and friendly. Beware!!! we took a taxi from Gard Nord station and cost us 50 euros for a 10 minute ride and subsequently, you can use an underpass from la Chapelle Metro to the station and it takes a 10 minute walk. We were warned on numerous occasions to watch out for pickpockets, so be careful. Keep your bags close to you and don't give them the opportunity. They are everywhere. The Ice Bar needs to be booked in advance and will cost 20 euros each. You do get 2 cocktails plus another drink and your are in the bar for just 25 minutes. Unfortunately, the hotel had a function on and the guests were in the Ice Bar, so we didn't manage to experience it.…"
7255,I was studying with a colleague for the Web Summit - we stayed for 4 nights in the family suite which was spacious and comfortable for just 2 of us.  The bathroom unfortunately had quite a few cockroaches who greeted me every morning & during the night and the shower had not been cleaned properly - I could see a previous guest's empty shampoo bottle & bar of soap on top of the shower door (there is no where to rest your toiletries in the shower).   The fridge did not work.  When I checked out the receptionist was quite abrupt and a little rude to be honest.  However the location was excellent as it was right next to the metro & we found 2 excellent restaurants within walking distance.  Overall good value for the location and for the event but the creepy crawlies were unwelcome…
7256,"Breakfast was really good.  Room was very clean.  Bathroom window was weird though ha ha.  Lovely hotel. Friendly staff.  Get on the tram and you can purchase a ticket to use on trams, buses and underground 20 euros only for 48 hours.  Do a lot of walking too or you will miss important sites."
7257,"Like many hotels in China, the Greenland Juilong Hotel in Shanghai presents a good impression in the foyer, bar and lounge areas but the bedrooms are poor. Mine was filthy and very poorly maintained. The bathroom floor was covered in cigarette ash ( in a non-smoking room!) and carpets and wall coverings were stained. Bar prices are higher than average and the breakfast buffet decidedly average."
7259,"Luxury and top class accommodation and facilities. Staff well train, professional and friendly.  Food and beverage very good. Conference facilities were good and worked well. For hotel with all of the above and a price to match one would think Free wifi is included.  It was not."
7261,This hotel was amazing! Incredibly clean always saw cleaners grafting! Breakfast was delicious staff very friendly! We arrived very late at night and was hungry… The person on the reception was able to order us food from a local takeaway and we could pay when they arrived! No request was too big for the staff here!The room is very central to everything that you would want to go and see if you can very close to the train station to when you want to venture further . We were on the Top floor and I’m claustrophobic so didn’t take the lift this was the only downside and not down to the hotel at all! I would absolutely go again although I would ask for a lower level room!! Once again hotel then why are you are brilliant highly recommend!
7262,"OMFG...FWIW I'm a local. I, yes I, picked this place for a special event and recommended friends and family to here as well for the event. I was and still am embarrassed for picking this hotel.  First, the hotel staff is rude and conceited. I put a request in for 3 of our 6 rooms to be on the same floor and adjacent to each other. Yes, its just a request...I wasn't willing to pay the $150 extra per room for you to ""block"" it these rooms had minors in them. So come time to check in, mind you it was 5pm, the rooms weren't ready yet. 5pm and the rooms aren't ready? Really? On a holiday weekend your rooms aren't clean at 5pm? Now here comes the kicker, she said and I quote, ""Well you have paid the $150 and they'd be ready by now."" Yes I explained to her to repeat aloud that…"
7263,"I stayed here one night during a business trip in Amsterdam and the hotel was well positioned with a cool reception area, fire feature and bar area. The people were nice and the breakfast good. The room was quite basic and the shower didn't work so managed only a cold shower. Overall it was fine, reasonable value and I noticed mainly young couples staying here so being a middle aged businessman, I'm probably not the target market. Ok but not fantastic. "
7264,"I know. This was the hottest summer in the baltic history but this is a 4 star hotel and there’s no excuses: air-con has to work. No way. The room was little and hot. Staff are very welcoming but they were teached to repeat the same old story: “sorry but we are in historic building and air-con is difficult to fix”.  Hey guys, I come frome Rome! Do you know Rome? We got buildings coming from 3rd century before christ and the air-con is just perfect! "
7265,This hotel does not tell you that they have two building and that you park at one and have to haul your luggage down a Main Street and across the road to check in to second building if that’s where they put you . Second once we checked in the room had hair all in bath tub and a smell of vomit/rotten milk. They refused to move us.. refused a refund of any kind and then proceeded to say .. oh well sorry .. you paid in full before you got here . They said we can send house keeping up to spray chemicals but that’s it .. so let me get this straight you want to spray some type of chemical and make us sleep in that room? DO NOT STAY HERE . We went to the front desk twice .. and when we finally checked out the third lady was just as rude as the first..
7266,Rooms were great. Food was great. Service was a 1 star at best in the restaurant. Bar was even worse. Slowest service I have ever seen. Cocktails had nice presentation. For the price find a medium. Staff was overwhelmed for no reason
7267,"Pleasant and quirky hotel, a collection of old houses, by the river. Front staff are great, rooms are large and have nice decor. The breakfasts are excellent and omelette’s are cooked to order. The only complaint was when i was going to order a glass of wine (in Porto it is good and cheap) and the waitress took my order but recommended a different type. Imagine my surprise when the glass cost 9.50 euros. Very naughty. But i would still return"
7268,Over the course of almost one week we tried to book a room at the Huntington hotel in San Francisco. First by email which was hopeless so we called them. Unfortunately the front desk was completely useless. On 2 separate occasions they managed to misrepresent the rooms (hint: it is possible to have 2 adults and 2 kids in a room) then also failed to connect us to someone who would be able to help. It seemed like the last thing they could be bothered with was to help. Getting a response on emails was also impossible. After the first (quick) reply we never heard back on our subsequent emails. To date we have not heard back. We gave up and booked a room at the Omni. What a difference! Very helpfull on the phone and great reception.
7270,This hotel has very good potential but needs a update to bring it up to 5 star standard ! Staff is very frindly and helpfull but the interior is a little bit 'tired'. Suggestion would be a shuttle to the Baixa...
7271,"I loved everything in this place! Calm area, tasty breakfast, the cosy balcony in the morning ...comfortable room and large bed !! Adorable and friendly staff !! They helped us a lot and answered all our questions to make our stay in Cannes unforgettable . We enjoyed our stay and we will definitely be back again ! Highly recommended"
7272,"On a stormy Sunday when 500 flights had been cancelled at O'Hare, you would think that management would be prepared to welcome a full house of guests. Not so. Only three check in agents were available for a line about 40 guests.  It took over an hour to pick up a key for a fully paid room. WiFi was hard to log into and unreliable. The HVAC system was incredibly noisy. There was paint chipping off the ceiling.  On foot from the United terminal it was easy to see the hotel sign but, it was hard to find the front door of the hotel.  Smart landscaping, signage, and paths would have helped. Food was so-so. On the bright side, our room service waiter was friendly and the food came on time. I expect better of a hotel that advertises incessantly ""if you are not satisfied, we'll make it…"
7273,My wife and me stay at this hotel for four nights and it was excellent the location was perfect and the breakfast was very delicious the staff was friendly and helpful as a member of IHG the upgraded our room on 10 floor I definitely recommend for this hotel 
7275,"Hotel EstanPlaza Paulista was a disappointment. The staff was very unfriendly and not helpful.The check in process was very slow and dis-organised. Close to  reception counter you get free jelly beans. The Hotel is located in Paulista area but is a 5-10 taxi ride away from main shopping plaza located in Paulista. The Hotel does not have safe deposit lockers in the room You have to request the reception for some  lock mechanism which you are supposed to put in the safe deposit box in the room to make it work.The reception is always in short supply of these locking mechanism.So please be very very cautious .The reception refuses to keep your valuables in hotel  locker, The breakfast buffet spread is good. The rooms are OK size with small bathroom.I fail to understand why would…"
7276,Very good central location close to Alexanderplatz. Easy to visit all the sights. There are plenty of bars and restaurants nearby. Clean modern rooms with well equipped kitchenette. We found it a very quiet hotel with very friendly staff.
7277,"By comparing to the standard in Europe, and especially in asia, the hotel price in Sao Paulo is quite expensive. For around USD300, you only get around lower 4 star standard. The hotel is bit old, while I think the location is close to certain business centres, it is not good for tourist to stay there, while in fact, Sao Paulo do not have much landmark after all, it is really a financial centre in Brazil.  The hotel breakfast is very basic and cold, we stayed there for 6 days for business.  The room is very old and duvet is quite thin. There is a pub close to hotel, a bit noisy at night."
7278,"Front office staff very friendly and helpful. Key didn't open the door lock at first. View from our apartment was into the brick wall of the building next door approx.1m away Balcony view was exactly the same - into a painted brick wall - not as depicted in their web-site photos. Car parking is non-existent - even on the street in front of the building. The recommended public car park facility just down the street closed at 8:00pm, and we were unable to get our car out to take our son back to his place, as he had caught public transport to meet us after he finished work. This was very distressing as he could not get back home after attending a function with us earlier that evening."
7279,"This is the most pathetic hostel I’ve come across in USA and Europe  The receptionist was so smug that he told me he’s doing me a favour by checking me in after 12 AM. And he was busy chatting with a girl than trying to check me in properly.   Secondly, the bed frames creak if you’re bigger than a certain size. I’m 6’ 220 pounds and I won’t risk climbing on the upper bunk.   The wifi is unsecured so good luck connecting your Apple devices.   Washrooms are dirty. Period.  Breakfast spread is as jam spread on bread. That’s about it.   Please don’t come here. Choose a costlier hotel if you have to. But not this. "
7280,Charged me $300/night and cleaning staff tossed trash into the toliet (had to fish out the plastic personally) + not making up the room . Cherry on top was terrible breakfast in the morning that doesn't go beyond toast + coffee. They would be better off running a hostel (if anything). Def do not recommend.
7281,"We stayed at the Miramar on a hotel and breakfast tariff. The hotel itself is very attractive and has delightful gardens. Breakfast, however, was disappointing - it's taken at the adjoining Garden Village and is mass catering buffet style. The fruit juices come in reconstituted form and are awful. The coffee also is dispensed from machines but isn't too bad. Some of the fruit is clearly from tins although some is fresh - it's a bit hit and miss. To do toast you have run bread through the machine at least twice, sometimes more.  Surprisingly for a hotel of this standard you have to rent sunshades at the pool. It would appear that if you take the half board option this is also provided at the Garden Village with a supplement if you want to use either of the Miramar's restaurants.…"
7282,We stayed for 4 nights. Comfortable room. We enjoyed a swim in the pool. We didn’t eat or drink in the hotel but the bar and the cafe looked respectable.   It’s convenient for touristing in Berlin. About 10 mins walk from the U-bahn.   We would stay there again. 
7283,"Easy walking distance to metro, close restaurants, clean rooms, decent breakfast and a really nice stay. The full sized tub was also a nice bonus from this room! Favorite hotel on our Europe trip this year."
7284,"Haaaakay, so, took my daughters (two adult, one teenager) to Paris. This place was the BOMB.  First, rooms are small, like most boutique hotels in Europe. I set my girls up in one room, me in another. My room was as standard queen, but smaller than my master bedroom at home. Fine for one person, but it would be hell for two, especially if you got into that disagreement about one of you looking too hard at someone else or something else (insert appropriate gender, organism, species). And believe me, there's plenty to look at. However, the rooms are nicely appointed, have a non-alcohol mini bar that's refreshed everyday, and my room had bitchin' French doors/windows looking down to the street below. Keep them open, you'll hear every sound. Keep them closed, you'll hear nothing.…"
7285,"Nice and easy to find,  hassle free checking in/out,  staff friendly, room spacious, bed really comfortable,  room was quite,  a little noise from the road but as expected,  clean room, shower was great. Location good for getting around,  walking distance to gallery lafayette and moulin rouge. Would recommend.  "
7286,"We arrived on a Saturday evening and found the rooms to be good, clean and with plenty of light. Next morning (Sunday) something broke when the toilet was flushed, and water kept running all the time. Someone came to have a look but could not fix it so we put up with the inconvenience. Next day (Monday) nothing had happened by mid morning, so went donwstairs and was told that it could not have been fixed the previous day, because ""technicians"" were not available on Sundays, but that it would be fixed that day, which it was. Why, with about 3 or 4 Radison hotels in Riga, they do not have a ""technician"" on call  to cover all of these hotels is beyond me!. Then on the last evening at this hotel before leaving for Vilnius, we had a buffet meal in the hotel dining room, which must…"
7287,"Very good location but would advise not staying Thurs, Fri & Sat as very noisey with nightclub backing onto premises (for families or light sleepers). Facilties ok but in need of updating showers, tv's. A shame there is not better cooking equipment as plenty of fresh produce at the markets."
7288,We stayed for 5 nights for my wifes Bday and should have went somewhere else.  The A.C. barely worked and it was not a heat wave.  We had 5 bad nights of sleep.  We asked but the A.C. was not even looked at.  The sheets and 3 of 4 pillow cases had black streaks after the room was made up.    
7289,"We stayed at the hotel for 6 days. Started with warm welcoming. The room was really nice and clean. Bathroom is amazing and shower is so big and fancy.We also loved the high windows at the room and great parc view from the bed. Also had a nespresso machine in the room which was very good for coffee drinkers like us. Most amazing thing about the room was the bed! Waow such a big and fluffy and so comfy it was o couldnt get out of it in the morning :) Mostly young and very friendly staff working at the hotel and they helped us about everything. On our last night they surprised me with a birthday cake and a baloon at the room which I found very kind and thoughtfull, thank you so much again for that!:) the hotel a bit pricey for the area but it’s worth it. It took us about 40’ to go…"
7290,"Great place to stay in an excellent location.  The bellhop was the best I have ever encountered, and the rooftop bar and bartender were amazing as well.  The rooftop bar was a great way to start the evening before heading out to see the city. I would absolutely stay there again!"
7291,"for the money paid here  ~450 USD/ DAY !! , this is a terrible 5 stars.  the offered services and the quality of the rooms are just obscene . they forget to deliver the laundry every single time, the bfast is a la cart only and the fruit they serve is not far from being made of plastic. the room keepers  slam the doors at any time of the day and night. the fridge is broken. The day i arrived i found brownish marks on the towels ."
7292,"We traveled with CostSaver-Trafalgar-Great European Tour which booked our motel accommodations slightly out from the city, but at comfortable, clean, accommodating locations without the extra expenses of gym, business center, conference room...since we just needed a place to sleep for two nights. The beds were comfortable and the rooms impeccably clean.  The breakfast bar was an unexpected surprise with a large variety of both European and American fare so we could experience new things of the Germanic culture and still have the option the comfort of the familiar. "
7293,If you need high speed Internet this is not the right hotel for you ! Upload download about 7 Mbps when Starbucks next door is 30 Mbps. We had 6 days stay. My husband and need up going to Starbucks every day. So inconvenient!! We talked to 4 people from front desk and we opened ticket with their IT department. They couldn’t do any thing. We couldn’t cancel since we got through third party . This was our summer vacation !!! We expected more than this from Hyatt!!!!
7294,A nice hotel. Not so far from center of the city.  The rooms are ok as well and the people are kind. The best part is the included breakfast and the worst is the wireless connection wich is working very slow.   
7295,"After arriving this past Friday night and requesting a different room due to the stench of cigarettes in our first room, we arrived to our room on the 4th floor after walking down the dungeon-like hallways.  The room was dirty and the bathroom was worse than some gas station bathrooms I've been in (see picture attached).  The room that had a locked connecting door but the door had about a 3-inch gap under it and thin walls.  After trying unsuccessfully to stuff towels under the door in an attempt to muffle the sound of the girls staying next door, who were not yelling but speaking at a normal volume, I could not help feeling like the conversation next door was happening in my room.  I went down stairs to ask the front desk to see if there were any rooms available without any…"
7297,"We stayed here for 3 nights and it is a lovely luxurious hotel - beautiful lobby, helpful staff, spacious rooms, great bathroom, comfortable bed and big TV with English channels. We didn’t eat here so can’t comment on the food. The spa downstairs was a nice touch - I went to the sauna each evening which was good after so much walking!   It is located 20 minute walk from Central Station and approximately a 30 minute walk from the city centre. Get a bike on the first day! They are cheap to hire and you would save a lot of time, particularly because the hotel is a little far out.  There was renovation work going on when I stayed on our floor. The drilling work started at 9:30am, 10:30am and 9:20am on the days we stayed! So it woke us up EVERY morning. Extremely loud and very early…"
7299,"hotel is under construction, lobby and entrance is not as shown at the photos. 2single beds combined to make 1 king size bed without any topsheet. wifi is a disaster, it logout when your are not on your phone, you have to reconnect all the time! bathroom amenities are very low: no creme, no shower gel, no hair cream.. there was only 1 liquid for all!, hyr dryer is not strong, no cotton, no shower cap, no earcottons. no kettle in the room to make tea or coffee! I  checked in at 22.00 and I asked for a late checkout which they couldnt arranged for free. location is good!"
7301,"The TV wasn't working the whole time I was there. I was told that Digital was ' down"" in the area . ( although I have friends who live in immediate vacintity and theirs were fine...?) Cleaners were really noisy in the hallways...banging/ crashing about. Room was clean"
7302,"Forget about the fact that the hotel is absolutely gorgeous and the rooftop bar has the most amazing view of the Eiffel Tower.  The room was absolutely tremendous with everything automated and controlled by an iPad. Room service breakfast every morning was an amazing touch provided by Kevin who checked us in and explained everything about the hotel that any guest might want to know.  Here’s the real kicker. My wife and I went to Versailles to check it out and on our way back to Paris we found a cute little restaurant that had farm to table meals. It was one of the best things we ate in France, but the most memorable thing was the bathroom at this restaurant. In the cute little bathroom there was a product called the Zwisher box. It’s sensed motion in the room and automatically…"
7303,"I'm a great fan or Rocco Forte Hotels and absolutely looked forward to staying here. It's a gorgeous gem incredibly well located in Central Berlin. The rooms are outstanding, large and perfectly comfortable after a long flight. Superb service, and it feels like a boutique. Loved it. "
7306,"Clean and functionable.  We had a 2 bedroom apartment, which had opening windows and 2 bedrooms.  Great to use at night if you don't want to eat out (or there is a restaurant downstairs).  kindly kept our luggage to our late flight.  Basically residential area.  Not many restaurants very close but only 10 minute walk to Friedrichstabe which has all amenities/shops/restaurants etc"
7307,"What a fantastic location. One minute away from La Ramblas! Easy to pop in and out throughout the day. 24 hours front desk made us very comfortable. Great safety step - you have to press the buzzer to get in. This  was very reassuring! No unwanted and random people inside!  OK,  It's not the grand design decor but it's clean and comfortable. Warm and strong shower. Basic breakfast but enough for everyone to have a good start of the day. I would definitely go back. Great value! "
7308,1. Hotel is 3 star. 2.Breakfast is truly horrible.  3.Noises from the street (cars).  4.Sea view rooms cannot enjoy the sea view 5.Very far away from shopping mall or like bus station.  6.English doesn’t work very well. 7. You have to pay for bringing your passport with you (they keep it till you pay).  8.Twin bed room but only one set of essential kits in the toilet.
7309,The location was great. Staff were friendly and rooms were clean. The bathroom door needed maintenance since it was hard to open and close. There was no kleenex in our room at all. Except toilet papers in the toilet. I guess its not too common in spain to have tissues in hotel rooms.but overall We would recommend this hotel for sure.
7310,"Me and my boyfriend came here for our anniversary, the staff were very friendly and helpful! The location was AMAZING, five minute walk to the Louvre, 20 min walk to the Champs Elysees (Christmas Markets), we hired bikes from a station right outside the hotel which was a fun way of exploring Paris and we rode to the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triumphe and other places. The metro for the Louvre is a five minute walk from the hotel also, which can be used to get around Paris. The room was clean with a super comfy bed! I would definately stay here again if I were to visit Paris again. "
7311,"It is NOT ACCEPTABLE to charge fees with NO DISCLOSURE.  I got a $17 charge plus taxes for an ""URBAN AMENITIES FEE"" total of almost $20 for one night stay.  It should be included in the total price and not slid in on the back end when it's too late.  When I questioned the person behind the desk and told her I was not made aware, the answer was lame.  ""it's automatic and just included as a standard"""
7312,"This hotel is very nice with lovely grounds and view of the lake. The breakfast was very good as well. However, the bed was very uncomfortable and the air conditioner in the room did not get cold enough so the room was hot at night."
7313,"Second time staying here, would stay again! Rooms and bathrooms are clean, beds comfortable, its not too noisy, staff are lovely, the location is perfect to get anywhere in the city, and you just can't beat the value for money! The breakfast is extra, but for €7 it's nice food, and worth it when you just want to get fed and get out the door. We will be back again :)"
7314,"Our family booked three one bedroom oceanview suites at Ka'anapali Beach Club in October 2013.  Our views would be classified as minimual partial view at best.  Hotel manger refused to speak with us (and others with complains at the desk) on numerous ocations.  Front desk clerks kept taking our questions to the managers office and coming back with information.  We were promised this would be handled but during our four days we kept getting the same anser.  Additionally, all three rooms had small ants in the kitchen area.  Mold was in one unit as well as roaches (I have photos of roaches, mold and our terrible balcony nonview).  This was our first trip to Hawaii and the joy was just sucked out of the trip by the poor reception and lack of customer service."
7315,I have found this hotel very good. The rooms are a decent size for two people and exceptionally clean. The breakfasts are excellent and the concierge is very happy to help. It is right near the S and U beans and very. Convenient to get around the city. Lots of places to eat nearby. My only complaint is there is very little cupboard and draw space for two people. Would recommend it though. 
7316,"We booked this establishment because most hotels in Amsterdam were either full or too expensive. The hotel is in an Amsterdam suburb, a ten minute bus ride from the train station. There is no restaurants or attractions in that area. The rooms were average with 2 single beds (no other accommodation was available) and with no air conditioning, it was difficult to have a good night's sleep, I must say that there was not enough storage for our clothes. The bathroom was small, with a distinct humid odor,  and with the door always closing, we could not air it after our shower. With no bars of soap, no facial tissues, I think there could be some improvement in that area. On the other hand, the breakfast was very good and the lady who was cooking the eggs, very nice. The restaurant is…"
7317,"There is no better address in Alexanderplatz than Park Inn. Middle of pulsating square which has every thing with in quick walking distance. Commuting , dinning , shopping , visiting all without having to hire a cab. So the Hotel gets FIVE star for that. Reception is a bit crowded . You have to await your turn. Not a big deal though. Christina was very helpful as a few of our pieces of luggage had not fetched up in the flight. So she made up for the bit of delay in checking -in. Its an impressive looking Hotel with most modern facilities , good view from higher floors, clean & neat. How ever , the tariff is on higher side. While booking , I had asked for higher floor & early check in. The Hotel demanded extra charges for these requests. We decided NOT to pay. Any how , we…"
7319,"I expected so much more.  CHECKIN We checked in the afternoon.  They let us know it would be a short wait and then offered us some water...but then never delivered.  We sat there and waited and eventually just had to ask for it. Not what you want after a long trip to arrive at the hotel. In the meantime, they helped two other people up to their rooms while we waited. The guy who checked us in was very nice though.  ROOM Very good use of the small size of the rooms.  My husband commented that there were mirrors to open up the space. I appreciated the non-alcoholic drinks and snacks included in the mini bar as a Diamond/Globalist. We had a canal view, but it was sad that the windows didn't open up to it.  Everything seemed fairly new though. The shower made a squeaking noise when…"
7320,"Beautiful hotel in Cannes, close to the rail station (safe place), very silent environment, with a good view from the Le Club (breakfast and buffet area), near the sea. Nice and wide room, very kind reception guy, tasty and full dinner buffet, good buffet breakfast, modern palace. No noise at all. Price competitive, what else? Ah, gym room available."
7321,"This was my first time in Amsterdam and our group, the weather so cool, when're arrived at hotel our group are tired, and checking every slow more than 25 minutes to procese, the staff not friendly and helpful, the location is OK around 15 to 20 to town, the room is OK and clean but not much amenities in the bathroom like toothbrush......, the breakfast no choice just only western food, I will try again. "
7322,"💀<—- me trying to figure out how the hotel is considered 4.5 stars. Torn furniture, no working AC in the room, woke up to a puddle in the middle of the floor from the mini fridge which was hidden in the dresser. Embarrassing. Don’t stay here. It disrupted our whole experience in the city."
7323,"Room was actually more modern and larger than I expected  so I was pleasantly surprised about that. Very clean throughout the entire hotel, and same with staff, willing to help in all departments. Great spot for a few nights."
7325,"Our room was clean, but the furnishings suffered from over-use. The light fixture fell apart when my husband turned it on. Wallpaper was peeling off the wall in the bathroom. The TV didn't work and it took two calls to get someone to look at it.   I ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant (Dine) and the service was terrible. I had to prompt the waiter to pick up my food, I had to ask him for a coffee refill, and my breakfast was cold when it finally arrived.  I asked the bellman for directions as well as information about bus tours. Neither he, nor the front desk person, could answer my questions.  This hotel was advertised as 31/2 stars, which it clearly was not. It was a long three days."
7326,"This was mine and my partners first time in America, we arrived at the hotel and had to pay a deposit of $100 for every night we stayed there, so if you are looking to book this hotel make sure you have enough spending money as there was hidden fees throughout the holiday such as taxes, room charges, $20 for an umberella on the beach etc.  We payed for one of the best ‘deluxe rooms’ there was nothing deluxe about the room if you ask me, the floor was concrete and stained with a dirty smelly rug to cover it, the tv was tiny and wouldn’t work half of the time, the balcony door either wouldn’t close or it would lock itself, we kept our room tidy so the cleaners wouldn’t have to do a lot but I think they only bothered to change the sheets and clean the floor twice out of the 7 days…"
7327,"Very good hotel, comfortable, good location, ideal for the city. Do not use the telephone in the room, 1euro per minute even for a local call. Reception  and cleaners all very good. Very clean accommodation and good news channel on tv."
7329,"I stayed 2 nights at the uppermost floor, in a room for 4 people. The room was clean, the bed was good, there was a nice view outside the window.   The bathroom was also clean, but smelled badly of mold.   I did not had the chance to eat breakfast because it starts at 8 am and I always left before that. The hotel seems to have merged with hotel Iris nearby, where the reception is located and you are supposed to check in and out."
7330,"I was lucky to get to stay with with the best Western capital hotel in Paris. My arrival to the hotel was early and I was checked in immediately and had an upgrade to my room. The reception staff were pleasant, professionals and make sure that they give their best attention to the clients. The hotel room that we stayed at was big enough the bathroom was also big and for your first-time guests stay the mini fredge drinks are for free. As for cleaning services I would recommend that you ask for the front desk staff help if you are not satisfied with their work and they will make sure to handle it.  The area is safe with a nearby pharmacy and supermarket, caffes and metro services that are available.  Special thanks to Sophie who is one of the excellent staff Stephan, Caroline and…"
7331,"A weekend trip to Berlin in Dec for sight seeing and Christmas markets makes this a great central location. A few minutes from the station and Check Point Charlie. Our room had nice decor and good amenities, plus a bath with shower and a wet room (drainage was an issue as needs a steeper drain away). The room we had was a twin, with individual duvets folded on the bed, a side chair and limited storage, but we were only there for the weekend so fine. Breakfast has a great choice, p,is a chef on hand for omelettes, eggs of your choice and other stuff. The bar is secluded and comfortable and there is a concierge with lots of local information. The receptionists seemed to be nice and multi lingual. All in all a good choice."
7332,"Poor welcome in the hotel. Once we came in, after a drive of almost one hour (that's how far it is from the airport) the receptionist didn't say anything - only sit down.  After checking-in I requested to get my passport back, which resulted in a sighting employee, who had to photocopy my passport now.  Room is okay. The hallways have stereo speakers, and they are playing music from the early morning until the late evening so you can enjoy Madonna & Phil Collins from your bed.  Bathroom has a very nice rain shower, also continuously hot water and good pressure. The room has a nice kind of living room part, which gives you a nice overview over the beach. Bed is too hard. My friend and I both had back pain the other day.  The website says the hotel has been build in 2015, we both…"
7333,Hotel needs remodeling and updating. We were there with a group for NYE party... and boy what a huge disappointment. We paid extra for VIP tickets and the event was nothing as described. The hotel staff had little knowledge of the entire event. We will not return to the Swissotel and we would not recommend staying there!!
7334,"Our party got stuck in an elevator between the 10th & 11th floors. The staff was very attentive to getting us out (although they didn't have a ladder and had to pull some of us out) and told us they would cover our room charges and valet parking. Since we had booked and paid through a third party, the hotel was unable to refund our room charge. We were then told to go ahead and have food and drinks on them and to just charge it to our room. We did and ended up receiving only a hundred dollar credit when the room cost had been over three hundred. The ironic thing was that the staff was so nice we believed them. We talked to other staff and guests that told us the elevator wasn't working properly earlier in the day and the hotel choose not to shut it down. One staff person told us…"
7335,"A small hotel, very central location. Helpful stuff, nice breakfast included in the room price. Nice oldish inner decoration.  But- the room on the 4th floor was extremely tiny. No place to move around. No room for your suitcase. Actually it's an attic with a slanting cieling. The tiniest bathroom. A small window. There is a coffee machine, lovely furniture, but no room to move around the bed. Extremely claustophobic.  I believe it's a nice hotel- as long as you stay away from the attic's room in the 4th floor...."
7336,"The rooms, suites, food, service, and ambience were all fantastic.  The services provided by the professional management and staff are the main reasons that we keep coming back.   The old world elegance is a rare thing, and we value their focus to make sure that everything about the lodging experience is excellent.  I highly recomend this hotel. "
7337,"Do not let this B&B fool you, the rooms are infested with spiders and furniture that is in disrepair. The description online described a plentiful breakfast, but instead I was met with cold eggs, cold sausages, and customer service that did not remedy any of the issues we had during our stay. AVOID, AVOID, AVOID! "
7338,"On first impressions, you would be forgiven for thinking that this hostel had pretensions of being either a boutique hotel or a jewelry store. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but it's not quite what we were expecting. What became clear very quickly is that there are a lot of thing about this hostel and the rooms that are not covered on the hostelworld website. You cannot pay by card, so make sure you have enough cash to cover your room on you, and also for any extras you might need - drinks etc. The other thing is that there are 2 private rooms, one on each floor, which do not have a window. We were in these rooms, and although there were fans in them to combat the heat, it did make them a little stuffy. Both things, if I am honest, that would have been a deal…"
7339,"Not value for the high price. No lift. Bad service, the room cleaned 5 pm. Location Very fine next to South Beach, which is a Very fine spot. Need a reconstruction, the toilet and aircon leaks wather all over the floor"
7341,"Novotel is always a safe choice when you are picking hotels.  They are clean, comfortable and usually have a very nice breakfast.  This one is no exception.  Staff was business like.  This hotel is right next door to a mall with options of good restaurants to chose from.  Rooftop pool and bar don a awesome view especially at night.  Camp Nou and Train Station is a little drive and it is quite a bit away from the airport (40 euros).  Most of the Barcelona attractions are not too far via taxi.  We walked over to Sagrada in 15 minutes.  There are so many pluses for this hotel.  The only thing I would complain about the room size.  This Novotel has the smallest size rooms compared to other Novotels I stayed in."
7342,This hotel has fabulous rooms and good food ok but badly let down by the hotel bar. The service is slow and I wonder if the bar staff know how to make a drink. Good luck if you are not fluent in Argentinian Spanish.  I have never had sugar added to a margarita in my life but just had a tablespoon placed in the bottom of my husbands glass. My daughter's lemonade the same and my chaiperenia also. Just shocking for a supposed 5 star property. Management you need to send your bar staff on a course....so disappointing.  I do not often leave a review like this but will struggle to recommend this hotel to my clients for fear of them questioning my judgement. 
7343,"Rooms are in desperate need of update, upgrade and renovation. Time (and cleaning) have stood still past Millenium (yes, pun intended). Boiler gave up in night so cold water showers only. Don't drop anything under the bed because you don't wanna reach in under the bed... Faucets in sink gave up and water only exiting straight on floor under sink.  Bed is aged and drooping into the middle. Air vent in shower is a legionella dust trap. Etc. etc.  But hotel staff are very kind and desperately trying to mend things, equipment and peoples feelings.   Oh,, and don't be in a rush when you wanna get the elevator down as average time to get elevator and get down from 27th floor is about 10 minutes...  In short: until they renovate this hotel you should stay well clear of it!"
7344,"We booked a one night stay while visiting during a work trip.  We were arriving late to the hotel and could not locate the front entrance valet that they insisted they had available to park.  We called explaining that we were unable to locate parking and were placed on a ""brief"" hold for 20 minutes before hanging up.  Once we finally located a back parking lot, we learned that it was also shared public parking which is not what we had been told 20 minutes earlier.  Once the parking was settled, we went into the hotel and the front desk staff was not very friendly and appeared to be put off that we had questions and requests upon check in, to include receiving a credit card authorization form to use a company credit card for payment.   The hotel looks lovely on the inside and…"
7347,"Went for a holiday to paris for my birthday and stayed here and I'm certainly glad we did, it was lovely. The room was beautifully decorated and clean and nothing was to much trouble for the staff they were extremely helpful also. The location was just fab and would most definitely stay here again and can't wait to return. Thank you :) "
7348,"Have just returned from a 3 night stay, great location, approx 5 mins walk from Central station. Beautiful building, with lots of history, we were located on the 1st floor, great size room with all the amenities one would expect from such an establishment. Unfortunately our stay was let down by the housekeeping dept., there was one day when our room wasn’t cleaned,I have never stayed in a hotel room that hasn’t been cleaned on a daily basis, when paying 5 star prices it is unacceptable for this lack of service to occur. On reporting this matter to the desk, there wasn’t even a receptionist to speak to, despite a member of staff being visible on a computer in the office a member of the concierge staff was sent over to deal with my polite complaint, an apology was offered by him…"
7349,"Finding the perfect hotel for your short break trip requires a strategic decision. Firstly you need one that fits your budget and secondly, it needs to be centrally located to maximize the time you have in a destination.  Chavanel Hotel ticked all those boxes and more during our recent stay in the capital of France. Probably my favorite feature of this concept hotel is its elegant and yet chic decor. When we entered the hotel, we were impressed by birches in the lobby. These interior details made me miss my homeland. A white-trunk birch is considered to be one of the emblems of middle region forests of Russia. We stayed in a Deluxe room which is reasonably spacious for Paris. It has two huge windows overlooking Rue Vignon that made it light. It was made up of a queen size bed…"
7350,Tiny dirty room that smelled of water damage. Blinds did not cover whole window.  Bathroom too small to use. Towels had holes in them.  Bed was cripplingly thin and uncomfortable. Great location. Not at all as shown on websites.
7351,"We booked this hotel as the location is reasonably close to so many attractions, ideally situated within walking distance to see many of Amsterdam's attractions.  I decided to book the deluxe room as a present for my boyfriend, as the photos looked lovely, portraying nice decor and space. Upon arrival I was so disappointed with our room, as the room looked nothing like any of the photos on the Grand Hotel Downtown website. The room itself was nothing like what the photos had advertised - the decor was very basic and brown. The room itself only had 1 bedside table which was fine, but not what you would expect for a deluxe room, maybe it shouldn't be a deluxe room if they can’t fit 2 bedside tables?   I feel the deluxe rooms should not be advertised with the photos that are on the…"
7352,"We enjoyed two nights at this beatyfull place in a cosy place at cannes. The employees were friendly and helpfull. The continental breakfast was also great. Good facilities with spa, pool and small kitchen in the rooms. Picture is the view from our balcony in our room. Familiy friendly. Thanks for a great stay :-)"
7353,The hotel is located in the heart of the city with almost everything around it. The hotel staff were very courteous and equally helpful with everything. A must stay for people on a holiday in Barcelona.
7354,"We stayed at this hotel for the labor day weekend in early September 2017.  The location is excellent, but we found much better options.  The hotel is mediocre and the pricing is rigged.  They up charge and the service absolutely stinks.  The check in / out process is terrible.  The parking per day was ridiculous at $47 per day.  The room we had was not very clean in fact we found dust and grime all over and the bath tub was stained and dirty.  Seems the cleaning is lax. The free cocktails are limited and enforced with tickets and it is packed.  The free breakfast was terrible.  The lines are so long that the food is cold by the time you locate any available seating. This is a MUST avoid location.  The weekend in Chicago was great but I would definitely NOT recommend this hotel."
7355,"Hotel is clean as are the rooms,staff very polite,beach and pool very good. Now for the negative: 3 restaurants,1/ Kitchen , food here is the worst i have ever experienced, uncooked chicken, lamb that bled as it was carved, eggs at breakfast burnt bottom raw on top then stack on top of each other. 2/ Ola restaurant not open to all inclusive guest until last two days of holiday, then only for lunch, the food was no better than the Kitchen. Restaurant 3/ The Shack, very good quality of food however a limited menu, if you wanted something from the other menu then you had to pay. To get a drink you would have to queue up sometimes for 20 mins or more ,give your order then sign for it then go a stand in another queue to get your drink which was often wrong..This hotel is far from All…"
7356,"We booked this hotel from an online service and had no problems. Check in and check out went seamless.  The lobby and breakfast area were clean and bright.  The location was very good for us - within walking distance (we like to walk) to Alexanderplatz, the public transportation was close by (and very reliable), and it was close to the people we were visiting. We were so busy, we never got the chance to visit the park next door. It looked nice though.  The breakfast was excellent with lots to choose from (although there was no variety from day to day - we were there 7 days).  The room was somewhat small. No drawers, but there were shelves in the closet. We had problems every time getting in the room - it took us several attempts each time (this was with a key, not a card). These…"
7357,Visited with family for our Paris vacation . The hotel is a true luxury hotel period !. Big elegant rooms with a great view . Rooms are loaded with cool technology ( can control pretty much everything with an iPad inside the room ) . House keeping staff were truly exceptional in terms of service . I did get the feeling during my stay where the hotel lags behind similar to others reviews is uniformity in service provided especially within the restaurants and luggage handling upon arrival . Overall though I would definitely recommend this stunning hotel if you are looking for a luxury Paris escape with family .
7358,"Arrived at the Sheraton convention center hotel somewhat exhausted not only the long journey but the lines at immigration & customs. There was also a long line at check-in but they were all cordial and efficient. She offered me an upgrade because of my Platinum status. My room looked as if someone had been there earlier, the bed was used as was the soap in the bathroom. Pubic hair in the bathtub, Hotel is dated and needs serious TLC. "
7359,"The building was very charming, the location was nice and de staf was friendly. The lower rating i gave is because i think the room was not clean. For example, the floor was dirty and there was a lot of hair from the previous guests on the ground. I really hate this. The room wasn't well maintained. That is a pity because there is a lot of potential."
7361,"This hotel has potential. Its in the low price range, so my expectations were not too high. But we started with a room that was not cleaned. People had pissed in the bathroom and the bed was not clean. We got a new room immediately, but no apology at all. The rooms are standard but good. The check in took a long time (despite my pre-checkin). At the bar area you are almost afraid to ask the staff for a drink. Only the guy that made cocktails at the Saturday evening was very friendly. Also morning at breakfast the staff is very unfriendly. The Wifi is ok. The hotel is not too far from Copacabana. Hotel management should take better control, because its not using its full potential of this hotel."
7362,"Motel One is my choice for hotels. Inexpensive, good value, clean, very well run. They also go the extra bit for their customers. They do not treat the customer as a nameless face. They will provide little extras and do it with a smile. I had a very nice stay here and would return any time."
7363,"Comfortable place for a family of 4. This was the closest place to the Nou Camp we were able to find. Check-in was made online, we receive a code on the phone. Lots of supermarkets around and easy public transportation. A late check out would´ve been appreciated."
7365,"The Fives Seas is an absolute gem! I stayed for a couple of nights during my recent trip along the coast. After a very disappointing stay at the Le Meridien in Monte Carlo, this hotel was a welcome respite. I knew things were going to be different as soon as I arrived, when the doormen were warm and welcoming and the check-in agent directed me to take a seat in the living room where she offered me a cold towel. Wow! What a great start! The entire ambiance of the main entry area is one of sublime relaxation. After a quick check-in process, I was escorted to my room and given a brief tour of the features.  The room was contemporary and had everything I could imagine, including a fully-stocked minibar with some complimentary options. My room was on the 2nd floor and had a view of…"
7367,"Pool was out of order for the duration of our stay.  Hotel staff were unaware of the issue or provided incorrect timelines of when it was going to be fix.  The couch in the suite was torn, seams were pulled apart and stuffing coming out.  This was shocking since the hotel was gut remodeled less than a year ago.  The hotel is pet friendly, but dogs barked on our floor almost the whole next.  Doors/walls not sound proof, so you could hear the barking and the doors slamming."
7369,The hotel is of reasonable standard. Rooms are clean although a little old and dated. Also the rooms are very poorly lit.  I booked my 4-night stay with Agoda back last September. I was not informed of the $20 per night “destination fee” which is little more than plain extortion. I was not informed of  the additional fee until arrival at the hotel at which time it is not possible to make alternate arrangements.  This leaves a sour taste with Hyatt and Agoda. I will not choose to stay at Hyatt hotels in the future.
7370,"Where do I start?! I booked this hotel for 3 nights, hoping to spend a couple days in SF and one day in Napa Valley. My friend selected this hotel based on the pictures and just a couple good reviews. I wish I had done more research before booking. We arrived on the BART and then took the bus, which dropped us off about 6 blocks from the hotel. We found ourselves in the Tenderloin area, dirty streets, crackheads and homeless asleep on the sidewalks everywhere. Although I kept telling my friend to stop looking up and scared, pretend like you're a local here... We clearly looked like tourists! We finally made it to the hotel but our room wasn't ready yet, so we had the shuttle drop us off at Union Square, did some shopping, and had lunch at the Cheesecake Factory. Four hours later…"
7371,"Staff was nice and location is ok even though not good, but the rooms need to be refurbished. There were scratches everywhere, there was a smell from the carpet in the corridor and in my room (655), the room was very warm and the air condition very loud. There were also no power outlets by the bed and the one for the shaving machine turned out not too work when I was picking up my Apple Watch the next morning. I would just not recommend anyone to stay here but instead stay at any of the other Radisson hotels in Riga."
7372,"We felt verry welcome in your hotel, the service of the employments was great and at our next visit to Berlin we definitely will return to you hotel. This also applies to the restaurant. Good food for a reasonable price!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   "
7373,"room was a little dirty, not the view i was hoping and paying for. everyone in my family complained about the pillows and had sore necks in the morning. we have stayed there before many times and was disappointed to see that the service has slipped."
7374,"Went here with a large group of colleagues for a kickoff meeting and everything worked quite smoothly. Quick check-in and check-out, comfortable rooms (although I never became friends with the A/C system) and a really nice breakfast buffet. Also centrally located in Berlin."
7375,"Bargain price for an expensive island. However, I thought some of the literature  was misleading when I booked as I was expecting to have a view over the caldera - although Imerovigli is on the caldera side once you arrive you will note that it is a very narrow island and the 'views' are actually facing away from the caldera...a small grumble only as you are less than 5 min walk from  the stunning oooh and aaah of the caldera bay. The owner was very helpful but after following the advice for the Helios bakery (very expensive for basics but the bread is average price and they had little pistachio chocolate biccies which were divine if also €1.50 for 2...) we decided to do our own thing. Interestingly no-one has really mentioned how poorly the apartments are furnished regarding…"
7376,"The rooms are adequate, they are quite spacious in fact. They lack electric sockets unfortunately, and some of them don’t work sometimes. The hotel is clean, with the maid visiting every day. There was three lights in our room, excluding the bathroom. The balcony is quite big with a table and chairs and a beautiful sea view! No window in the bathroom. Beds are reasonably comfy and the curtains keep the light out in the morning. Steep hill to and from the pool area, which is on the tenth floor. This hill IS NOT SUITABLE for old people, as there is no lift to get to and from the pool. There’s a lounge in the hotel for drinks which opens at 6pm, if you want a drink or food during the day you have to go to the pool, up and down the steep hill as the bar down there is the only place…"
7377,"We had a relaxing and wonderful stay at Das Stue. The staff were welcoming and efficient, the location was far from the crowds and just adjacent to the park and zoo. A brisk walk brings you to the street market and shops of Kudamm and the Kaiser Wilhelm church."
7378,Booked in for a three night stay. Room was spotless and comfy.  Air conditioning did not work despite putting settings on to cold. Told staff on the desk and was given a load of rubbish that as it was only 10 degrees outside the aircon would only pump out warm air!!!! Is that how air conditioning works? I thought you had the choice how hot or cold your room should be?  On the third day the T.v packed up and no signal could be obtained. Asked if there was a problem and they said yes but the engineer had gone home and that was that!!   Despite these two minor complaints we had a great time here in Berlin.  Would I recommend this hotel? Yes it's a good base if you just want to dump your stuff and go.  Restaurant for evening meals was great and service was great. 
7379,"We love this hotel on the romantic Left Bank, just across the Pont Neuf from Notre Dame Cathedral and 2 mins walk from the Boulevard St Germain. Very clean and comfortable; the helpful staff speak good English. Highly recommended. "
7380,"I booked a room at the Wheeler Mansion for tonight for my daughter, who was going to be working tonight and tomorrow at a convention at the nearby McCormick Place. The room was booked through Expedia. I was excited for her because of the attractive but non-refundable price (the price had dropped significantly yesterday from the Wheeler Mansion's normal rate), the included parking and breakfast, the interesting looking property, and the proximity to McCormick Place. We understood that it is not a conventional hotel, but rather a converted mansion. I pointed out to my daughter that she would have to be there before 7 pm, as the front desk is only open from 7 am to 7 pm.  She contacted me at 4:25 pm Chicago time to tell me she was at the Wheeler Mansion, but that Wheeler Mansion…"
7381,"I booked the hotel after reading several reviews, however I was still on the fence about it even the day before arrival. After putting more faith in the good reviews over the bad I decided to stick with Hotel Abri. This turned out to be a terrible mistake. Don't get me wrong, the lounge, the room decor, the bathroom, the bed, and the location were all great; but the overall experience was very poor. We had valet take our car ($40) and left our bags with the hotel as we arrived far too early to check in. We were told that we would receive a phone call when our room was ready. After several hours of shopping around Union Square and no phone call, we decided to head back to check the status of our room. It was 3:30 at this point and they said our room was still not ready. The staff…"
7382,"We had two rooms - one for my son and another for my husband and I. We had no bath but my son had a shower and bath. The toiletries in our room were half empty. The hotel is very close to Central station and yet the immediate surroundings are nice and quiet.  The entrance lobby is very small, the bar is very pleasant but there are no other communal areas. The hotel has obviously stopped doing dinner in the restaurant (now just a breakfast venue) but it is possible to eat in the bar and choose from a bar snack menu or specials on the day. The 'specials' are not written on any menu nor are the prices for these visible or charted. On our first day I had the lobster bisque (which had two scallops within), my son had cod and my husband had steak. The food was expensive. I was…"
7383,"This property got the second star only because of its location..close to the Old City and the Bus Station.  It lacked charm, ambience and warmth.  We nicknamed it Mengele's Waiting Room. Riga can be dreary enough in winter but to come back to a room that echoed the weather was like walking the last mile to an unknown destiny. We only stayed there because it was paid for by our company.  Dreadful.  Don't do it!"
7384,"This is a very good hotel located just outside Cannes city centre, with short distance to the beach (2 min walk) and downtown Cannes (10 min walk). The service and assistance provided by the staff is very VERRY good, especially from the front desk and those who clean the rooms.  We had a room in 5the floor with sea view (nice) and this room had very good beds. This hotel is well maintained, very clean and has a good standard. Thanks for a great stay, we will definitely be back and would highly recommend the hotel.."
7386,Very nice hotel and service BrilliantOn the service was unbelievable everything is very good the service reception’s room service the rooms tall is the beds comfortable ones all the stuff they’re very friendly and this morning in the breakfast everything this is the first time I was in proceed the hotels like this with the same price and the price is unbelievable very
7387,"This hotel is steeped in history and has such a unique architecture. Rooms are quite varied, as we were staying with another couple and their room you’d think they were staying at a different hotel.  The check in process was quick and easy, although the staff were a little blunt. Our room unfortunately didn’t have many working plugs which made charging phone and using hair straighteners a challenge. There was also no mirror anywhere near a plug socket which made straightening hair very difficult.  Breakfast was very good quality and lots of selection for all types.  Check out was simple and the locker storage is perfect if you plan to stay and go out into the city. Location wise, it’s a 10-15 walk from the centre of Amsterdam so I’d definitely recommend this as a good base for…"
7388,"We Checked in at 4 pm, and was told room is not ready, we asked for King, they said yes it is, came back at 10, room were 2 bed, complained,was given room with King bed but the bath room didn't have a door, and was told we are sold out while 1/2 of the hotel was empty!!!! The other room we took( we reserved 2 rooms) also was supposed to be king but was not and we flushed the toilet and water didn't stop tell 2 inches filed the bathroom floor and the room. Kids running the place and had a written statement to tell customers. I would never go there again! Nothing was pleasant about the place!"
7389,"My boyfriend and I were booked to stay here through Expedia (bad job on my part for not doing enough research before booking). Was hoping for a fun weekend in San Francisco in a cool area, but immediately upon entering the King George Hotel I was gravely disappointed. The room had a musty smell to it, dusty, paper thin walls, no AC, view was of another brick wall, dreary and depressing! I asked the staff if they had rooms with AC and they said no. Then I told them I would be cancelling my stay (purchased travel insurance through expedia so I could do this without repercussion if need be) and they told me one room with AC just opened up... so I went to see the room with AC and it was worse than a motel room. Downgraded bed to a queen from King (in our reservation), window AC unit…"
7390,"This hotel goes by many labels, ACME Serviced Aparments and Haiyue Binjiang Serviced Apartments, to name a few. So do not be fooled by their many monikers on the web. I stayed here with my colleague for a business trip, and it was absolutely horrendous. The front desk was incompetent and the rooms aren't that great either. The amenities were sub-standard, and were at the brink of falling apart. Once we got locked inside of our rooms and couldn't get out. We even had problems with our payments. It seems like, they do not even know how to operate their own credit card machine, resorting us to pay cash weekly, which was excruciating, being charge international transaction rates by each withdrawals at the ATM. I do not suggest staying here. If you're looking for a place in pudong, better stay around Century Avenue (easy access to public transportation and various facilities).…"
7392,"This hotel is really well located - a stone's throw from trocadero square with a direct view of the Eiffel tower and very handy for the Champs Elysees shopping; good metro service just round the corner. Everything is very easy and accessible from here. The rooms are attractively furnished and decent-sized, with good comfortable beds. The hotel staff are really warm, friendly and helpful - we met Christine and Idris who never tired of helping us out. Definitely to be recommended!"
7394,"My stay at the Sorbonne was great. The environment was calm and welcoming. The hotel was very clean as well. The staff was very professional and nice. If I ever had a problem (I rarely did), they were quick to help. One employee  that stuck out to me the most was Alain. He was very sweet and hardworking. I'll be sure to stay at Design Sorbonne the next time I visit Paris!"
7395,"Sort out some easy to fix issues with the bedroom and this would be 4.5. A noisy airco fan that could not be turned off, lack of privacy in toilet, due to glass window,  lack of power sockets making phone charging difficult"
7396,"I thought it would be nice to stay on a boutique hotel close to the Embarcadero for one night in SF. Big mistake! This was the WORSE experience I ever had in a hotel! I have a hard time understand how a ""so called hotel"" can remain open with the kind of service and rooms that the Griffon offers.  We checked in around 8pm on a Friday and Natalie at the front desk assigned us to room 308 - a king size standard room. We arrived at the room and the key didn't work. I called Natalie and she sent Luis with the correct keys and we were able to enter the room. That was the beginning (or first red flag) of our nightmare at this hotel.   First thing we notice was how muggy and warm the room was and then the strong smell of sewer took us by surprise. Second, we notice that the room had no…"
7398,"Not very content with the hotel stay. The hotel is old, outdated and smells. Lots of bums, and drug dealers in the area. The location is close to downtown and transportation, but was afraid of my safety. Not recommend for family stay. Restaurants near by are smelly and dirty from a the homeless roaming the streets. Overnight stay parking was $52, a night for vehicle. Price of hotel does not meet expectations, very disappointing, won't stay here we again!!"
7399,"Stayed only one night before my cruise and the only good thing I can say about this place is that is in a good location.  No elevator, noisy and dirty. No early check out or late check outs. The guy at the counter was nice and friendly."
7401,"So called ""resort fees"" and ""destination fees"" are sleazy and are a scam.  Full stop.  If your business model depends on gaming travel sites and your guests with these offensive fees, and/or on charging your customers for pseudo non-benefits, then you deserve every one-star review you get.  Hey Hyatt, show me a single hotel guest who thinks these rip-off fees are a good deal or represent any sort of value at all.  Come on, go ahead.  Everyone else reading this, google ""resort fee class action lawsuits"" and consider joining!  It's free, no ""class action lawsuit destination fee"" required!  It's a real feat, Hyatt, to turn a thirty-year fan and guest like myself into someone who now publicly supports and recommends aggressive class action legal action against you, your properties,…"
7402,"I would have given it two stars but I have downgraded to one star. The location is great, rooms nice but service rough. Our check in was slow but that can happen.  I was with a group and all my expenses were to be paid by the group. They had my credit card for incidentals.  I had a latte in the lobby bar with my reusable cup. $8.35 and she poured the shot into the cold dirty cup. Starbucks cleans and heats my cup for $5. They're just around the corner.  They mischarged me for the resort fee. I called the hotel and explained the situation. They said they would call back. Never did. I tried calling four times and was put through to a full voice mail.  I put a review on their page and I was advised to contact complaints. I did this, and then received a form. I filled that in and then received an email to them my statement. IN all my travelling experience, this has only happened one other time, a hotel making it so hard to reverse their mistake. They propably amke a good business at this.…"
7403,We had a fantastic stay at the Barcelona next door Gothic Window apartment. Close to everything and a comfortable size. Great air conditioning!! Easily slept 4 with plenty of space. Supermarket right downstairs. Beds a little rickety but all in all a great stay. Thanks Barcelona Next Door!
7404,The worst hotel I have ever stayed at. The service was awful and the manager was extremely rude. They treated me like I was a peasant. The rooms are tiny so don’t expect much out of it. WARNING: they charge you a ridiculous deposit at check in. So many other better hotels in Miami. If I could give negative stars I would. 
7405,I spent almost an hour taking cate of reservations expecting to check into the hotel with my children. When I get there I was told my connecting rooms were “close enough” on the same floor and the receptionist was extremely rude. The valet attendant was in a bad mood. The hotel has general Horrible staff. 
7407,"the front desk is amazing.  the ladies and gentlemen who work there are incredibly helpful and kind.  they are quick with a smile and approachable.    security (which i'm sad to report that i had to deal with) was friendly and attentive.    you may at this point wonder why the establishment gets only one star, though.    it's simple.  housekeeping stole two pieces of jewelry from me.  i know it was housekeeping as the thief was obviously someone who did not know me AND my husband and i were the only other two people in the room that day.    it is true that only TWO pieces were taken an that they were probably only worth $500-$700.  however, the ring that was taken was the last thing my mother gave me before her stroke.  the necklace... well the pendant was a gift from my sister…"
7408,"The staff was helpful and friendly but every floor was being ""remodeled"" so it was filled dust and just dirty and not what you'd expect from a hotel affiliated with the Marriott. The front desk gal convinced us to upgrade our room to a high floor- view was ok, but not worth the extra $20 a night and even being on the highest floor you could still hear all the sirens. After check out we received bogus charges from valet even though we did self parking. Wouldn't waste money on this place."
7410,"We liked everything in this hotel. The room was very comfortable. We were surprised that we could even see the Eiffel Tower out of our window! The breakfast room seemed not very big, but we had everything we wanted and we needed for breakfast - it was very good! The sauna was working all day, which also impressed us very much. The staff was very polite, friendly and helpful. Also the lounge of the hotel was very beautiful and comfortable. We saw absolutely no disadvantages during our stay!"
7412,"This is the kind of good loocking hotel, well situated in Funchal. Pretty good rooms. Good food. But... they try to suppress any service! Yes:  - first as in many hotels they ask you not to change the towels. All right.  - But now more: they ask you to accept they will not to clean the room!! Miracle: they offer you a wonderfull reduction of Euro 3.00 to be drinked at their bar. - And last but not least they impose you no service at all on August 15th. They explain it is to save the planet!!! or save water!!! or any other stupid idea (who change according to the language you read). The true reason is to be else: on 15th August there is a bank holiday and they must pay double for the workers. Shame on the Four Views to do that to the poor employees! - What next? will they…"
7413,"While the hotel was fine, even with our reservation and arrival on time, we were delayed entry to our room for three hours. Because we had just arrived in Portugal and were weary, this was not the way to begin our visit. We weren’t even offered any sort of compensation for the inconvenience. "
7414,"A small hotel situated a short tram/train/bus ride from the centre. A little,tired in places in the hallways for instance but very clean. The room although not large was perfectly adequate. Complimentary Tea & Coffee and a medium bottle of water (2€). WiFi worked well. Excellent shower, comfortable bed and TV. All we needed. There was some road noise, particularly emergency sirens but in fairness it didn't disturb us. The staff were without exception helpful and friendly, with advice as,to where to eat etc. The breakfast was included but the cooked items,were not good, would not have paid separately.We bought a 72 hr travel pass at the information desk at Schoenefeld Airport. This allowed us to take 30 minute RB14/RE7 to Hauptbannhof the main Berlin station, then two tram stops…"
7415,"I had long admired The Drake on numerous visits to Chicago but had never stayed until a family wedding on 30th Dec. What a disappointment! My room was dated, noisy and cold. The staff at the bar (the pub with the french name) were grumpy and looked liked they hated us as well as their jobs! There was a large group of us staying and all commented on their surprise at the state of the rooms n the lack of warmth from the bar staff. Thankfully the wedding (not at the drake) was wonderful!   "
7416,"Fantastic location, 10 minute walk to the station and 15 minutes to the beach.  Our room was cosy and clean. There were 3 of us staying here and we were given a room with a double bed and 2 singles; it was a very spacious room!  The shower had good pressure and our toilet was in a different room to the shower.  Our room had a kettle with coffee provided (we brought our own teabags!). We also had a mini fridge to use as well.  I would recommend a stay here to anyone visiting Cannes.  "
7417,"We stayed at this property from December 27th-29th, 2019. There were 4 of us (two couples) sharing a room.  We checked in quite late after a long day of transit from Canada. Once we got into our room, there was a dog barking in the room next door. The occupants had clearly gone out for the evening and left their dog in their room. We tried to sleep, but the constant yapping was relentless.  After midnight, and near the end of my tether, I went down to the front desk to complain. I have no problem with a hotel accepting dogs, but you need to have a clear policy in place for when that dog is disrupting the experience of other guests. I asked the front desk to call the guests cellphone to let them know their dog was barking. They did not have a cellphone number for the guest in…"
7419,"The hotel is situated in a wonderful place not really close to the city center but it's really a plus cause you have a nice clean and not over crowded beach near by with 2 places to have a drink in the afternoon. The check in was so perfect (thanks to the guy on the reseption) that the stay used to be really nice. But what you will face here if decide to stay...  - ""dnd"" table on the door will not stop housekeeping to ring the door and then to come in with out any urgent reasons for that or to come in the room few days later without any rings or knoking; - food in the restaurant will be nice, but guys there leave you to serve wine by yourself or may ask you to move to the bar as they start to clean restaurant before close time; - you will not find matches all over the hotel; -…"
7422,"What a little gem, rooms are a really good size and lovely decorated. Staff are helpful, breakfast is great and to add to all this you get free cool drinks and water in your bar fridge and they offer free snacks in the lounge downstairs which is VERY generous. I had a great stay, THANK YOU TO ALL YOUR STAFF especially SAIDA ;-)"
7423,"I had high hopes but they were dashed when I was told at check-in that the rooms do not have A/C.  This is an old and ""eclectic"" hotel called boutique but it felt like lipstick on a pig.  There was an old ceiling fan and they offered me a box fan but it was sweltering and I woke up dripping in sweat.  I heard it was unseasonably warm for SF but it's June.   I would not stay here nor recommend it unless you're on a serious budget and don't mind having no AC.  Front desk staff was very nice and welcoming though."
7424,"I booked two rooms for this hotel and left my card to reserve both. Online it asked for a name for each room, under one I put my name, the other a friend’s name, who will be visiting for part of the stay. Three of us were to stay in the two rooms, with my friend going later for a day or two. So, when I arrive I am told I can only book one room, even though I booked and paid for two rooms. I explained that the other person was not here and would not be here the whole time, so just put the rooms under one name, mine. They said no. Even though my friend never booked anything, I could not use the two rooms I booked. Beyond that, the staff are not welcoming and the hotel looks like an ordinary Marriott. There are much better choices. I will never stay here again."
7425,"In two previous visits as part of a business trip when you just sleep in the hotel and you oversee details. Then we came as a couple for a long weekend and negative details pop up and scream at you. Among them: poor breakfast, web photos of room do not match reality, a lousy shower, a killing monstrous bathtub, bath towels that are years late to be garbage, electrical plugs that do it work or are in strange useless walls, no way to block light out for sleeping, strobo light in the bathroom due to an apparent short circuit -- ok, I should have complained and ask to fix some of those and I did but I have been completely ignored. Anything positive about it? Yes, great and nice location at Recoleta and the nice guy who checked us in and granted us a two hour late check out. If you…"
7426,"The Good:  Very nice and friendly people, both at the front desk and breakfast/restaurant.   Good breakfast and super location.  Not so good:  The room size was extremely small, even though I am a Discovery Gold Member, and had two rooms, one for a week and another for my son for two nights  I was not given an upgrade for even one room.  The bath rooms were incredibly small with NO place to hang clothes.  In fact in one of the rooms with a shower, which I had requested as the tub was too high, there was no place for toiletries and bath mat, all of which were left on the shower floor every morning. Although the water bottle was replaced every day, the milk/cream for the coffee/tea making facilities was not.  There was no milk or cream for complimentary tea/coffee in the lobby. I…"
7427,"We booked here for a little relax after staying in some much cheaper places, but didn't find it at all.  The rooms were fine, but this whole resort is (as other reviews have said) very dated. We felt like we were in a time warp. The one thing that can't be forgiven about this resort is the food. We order a Vietnamese starter and two Vietnamese mains and two of three dishes were inedible.  The waitress took one item of our bill (unprompted), but we still left feeling very disappointed (and hungry).  I'd suggest putting your money somewhere else- we wish we had!"
7428,"I had booked this hotel for two nights, believe me I checked out 1 hour after I checked in ! don't you think about staying here if you are a single person(female), the front office closes at 21:00 at god knows what's gonna happen after that,...the rooms are sooooo small and filthy! the restroom as small as in planes...terrible terrible, you will find great deals at hotel warwick which is adjacent to this dirty place. I defn. should have taken pictures from the rooms! made a mistake..."
7429,We stayed here for a romantic weekend. The staff were lovely and welcomed us with a large smile every time. The room is spacious and comfortable. We had a lovely stay and would Definitely stay here again in our next trip!
7430,"We went on a day trip to Key West. When we got back, I noticed that $250, my laptop and the charger were not there. There were no signs of forced entry, the safe was broken and the beds were made.  What I do know is that we got back at 9:30PM on Tuesday, and I had to wait until Wednesday at 11AM to talk to a ""manager"" who I had to go out and look for after I asked to be contacted as soon as she got in. She then said that she was not responsible at all. She then proceeded to accuse me of stealing my own laptop!! DO NOT STAY HERE!!!! "
7431,"I was recently at this hotel as a business traveler. My company has it as a preferred hotel however we have other preferred hotels I will be staying at after this experience. I was moved from the 33rd floor to the 31st floor after encountering tattered furniture, and peeling headboards where someone's greasy head has damaged the headboard. The situation only got worse. The room on the 31st floor was smaller and had the SAME damage to the furniture. I sent a note to the front desk manager upon returning home from my travels and he has chosen not to respond or acknowledge me. Bad. Won't be staying here again. It's really unfortunate this happened and tarnishes the Fairmont brand for sure."
7432,"Booked 2 days before arrival, was charged twice for full payment prior to arriving. Front desk said that they had charged a holding deposit and asked for payment on arrival , we had a long discussion about how I’d paid twice already. After a bit of a struggle they looked into it and realized that they had charged me twice. They said they would reverse the charges but I still had to pay again. Very weird method, so my card is charged 3 times for a 2 night stay with 2 Credits coming on the slow train. Now, about the accommodation, booked what was advertised as a suite. Nooooooooo not a suite, not even a large room that could pretend to be a suite, fridge leaking all over the floor, property itself is not bad at all..... my first night, will keep you posted on more."
7433,"We had a pleasant stay in Scandic, I stay here for the second time and can recommend this hotel for any kind of trips. Service was helpful, it was possible to spear English almost everywhere in the hotel."
7435,"I had a really nice stay at goodnight. The people are so nice, fabio is great ofcourse! He made us sangria every night haha i hope he read this. It's clean and cool. Everything is nearby. I recomend this place to everybody!"
7436,"We stayed 5 days including Silvester. Very clean room, my compliments to housekeeping. Breakfast is also very good, wide range of choices. The location is perfect if you want to stay in Berlin Mitte. The public transport station is nearby. Would recommend this to everyone."
7437,"We stayed for two nights in this hotel and we booked the premium room. At the checkin we where offered free coffee, thee and water. In the room the coffeemaker was not working. The airco was making a lot of noise. In the room we found a cockroach of 4 cm.  The breakfast was good, only when the subway was passing it was trembling a bit.  We noted all those facts at the front desk an they promised that the manager will contact us. We also send a mail, but no reply from this NH hotel. For me who is frequently coming to BA it was the first time in the NH hotel, and I was very disappointed indeed. "
7438,Hotel is well located and have stayed here on a number of occasions. Breakfast is good . One issue is that in the last three visits I have had problems with key failing to work after 24 hours which is a pain
7439,"We stayed at this hotel for a week in December. We booked way back last winter and got a very good price for flights and hotel.  We have been to Madeira several times before and fancied staying in Machico because we knew it is quiet, has good transport links and a sandy beach.  The hotel was built in the 70s and could really do with a refurbishment throughout.  There are a lot of cracks in the exterior rendering to the building which are unsightly and slightly concerning. There are some nice outside areas but they are a bit run down and scruffy and in several places the paving was cracked and uneven and potentially dangerous as the raised broken edges were very sharp.   While we were there the pool bar was never opened, even on the couple of days that the weather was good enough…"
7442,"Stayed at the Leonardo for the weekend. It is roughly 20 mins away from Schonefeld airport. Get the 171 bus from the airport, will cost 3.10 Euros. The bus stop is right opposite the hotel. You won't miss it. Located a few doors down from McDonald's which is perfect if you arrive late.   The hotel reception staff were very friendly and helpful. They looked after our bags for a few hours after our check out time which was really helpful. You can get bus tickets from the reception for zones a and b which take you to Berlin. Get a travel card for 7 euros because the public travel system is so easy to use so it's the best way to get around.   The rooms were clean and totally adequate for your needs. We were in room 217 looking out onto the road. We did not hear any traffic so it was…"
7443,"I cancelled my original booking for Ohla Eixample's sister hotel Ohla Barcelona after reading critical reviews of its dark bathrooms and leaking showers. It turned out that my three-night stay in early May at the Ohla Eixample Hotel was a very pleasant surprise. I booked directly through the hotel's website because they had a junior suite promotion - great value for money at less than CAD$400 per night including a welcome alcoholic beverage in the lobby bar, a buffet breakfast and in-suite complimentary bottled water.  The boutique hotel is in a quiet residential neighbourhood and is close to a Barcelona Jump On/Off Bus Tour route on Passeig De Gracia, one of the city's main avenues. Gaudi's renowned architectural building, Casa Mila or La Pedrera - a UNESCO World Heritage site…"
7444,"This is a classy hotel with large comfortable rooms, excellent breakfast, helpful efficient enthusiastic staff, good location, up to date furnishings, and modern bathroom. Very genteel afternoon high tea. "
7445,"I had stayed the week before in a different, but similarly priced hotel near Gare de Lyon, and I was expecting this one to be similar, but it was so much better. My room was newly renovated and decorated. Tasteful, clean and with really nice touches like a funky little lamp, a coffee maker instead of instant coffee, and nice toiletries. Loved it."
7446,"The Good: We went all inclusive, as there aren't many restaurants near the hotel. The staff was wonderful. Filipa at reception always remembered us. Pedro at the Pool Bar and Lobby Bar was so kind. Mauricio served us most nights at the dinner buffet and knew our drink order, and always ensured our drinks were filled. The grounds and room were clean. The location of the hotel is amazing, and provides lovely views of the ocean. Entertainment was good. Decent selection of all inclusive drinks. Lots of places to sit by the pool. Honestly, the staff and location is the only reason I gave 3 stars.  The Bad: The rooms are AWFUL. The walls are paper thin. We could hear our neighbour's conversations as if they were in the room with us. We could hear the people above us talk. The bed is…"
7448,The hotel is located well. There was no hot water in the room even after letting the tap on for 10 minutes. Had to shower in cold water in this chilled climate. Fell ill after that. Very bad experience overall. 
7449,"your front dispite the pre booking and reject to receive me when i ask for check in. But situation is that i already got the booking confirmation when left hotel. While i returned in the 9:00 in the night, your front ask for a extremly hight price and even say there's no room, pls check and how it can be for the client who had been using your service for over 10 years ? "
7450,"This was my first hostel stay but it was nothing out of the ordinary because I've spent lots of time in dorms. There's a lot to like about Stayokay Stadsdoelen, particularly: 1) The location. When all the hotels around you are charging upwards of 200 euros a night, you know you've found a good place. In fact, the hotel is somewhere between all the districts and just far enough from the Red Light district that you don't have to pass through it if you don't want to. It's very close to the train station (15 minute walk), the Museumsplein (20 minute walk), Rembrandplein (5 minute walk), the Dam (10 minute walk), etc. Some rooms have great views over the canal also. 2) The staff were always friendly and dealt with the most mind-numbing questions from guests. Their patience cannot be…"
7451,This was probably the worst stay I ever had in a hotel. Unfortunately we arrived from a week long trip in the mountains and had no Internet to check alternatives. Our bad.  The rest is to blame on the hotel. They charged us 212$ for one night. The next night we spent in a 4 star Hotel with included breakfast for less than 200$. The car park is accessable to everybody - not so nice in an area where 80% of pedestrians are homeless and drug dealers.  The 'free WIFI' is so slow that it is rendered useless. The walls seem to be as thin as paper and there was no warm water in the shower.   I'd be OK with all that but at that price it's a scam!
7453,"Small hotel in a superb situation. It is only 5 minutes walk to the sea front where waves crash in. Rooms are fine, not luxurious. There is a very small swimming pool. The water was VERY cold (March). Meal were fine but not exceptional. Staff were very friendly and helpful. It is possible to do wonderful mountainous coast walks from the front door of the hotel."
7454,Location and kind staff - yes!! Sleep: none! Hotel is old so people next and above you will keep you awake if they talk or walk! Def wouldn't stay if you want to sleep Bathroom is dirty (I kind of was postponing my first shower ) and heating is central so if you are cold but centralised heating doesn't start for another 3-4hrs you will be cold (happened to me) No wardrobe and space is basic so for example didn't have a bedside table so book was on the floor or on my feet on the bed  No breakfast option
7455,"I have nothing nice to say about this hotel.  It should be a 2 star hotel.  Staff were not very friendly and the hotel is very run down.  Rooms look as if they haven't been upgraded in ions. You could hear everything in the rooms next to you. It ruined our weekend.   We Will NEVER stay here again, even if it was free!!!!!!"
7456,"I have no real complaints to make about this hotel apart from it is not exactly 'city . However, it is 2min walk from nearest underground which is also excellent, cheap and very user-friendly.  Staff were very helpful and friendly. Room was large and very comfortable if a little over-heated but that is to be expected. Coffee and tea facilities were in the room. Only used the bar which was very nice and served bar meals which were reasonably priced. Restaurant was expensive but did look good. Breakfast at €10-17 was too expensive but within a 100m of hotel were plenty of good coffee shops and bakeries to eat. I would recommend this hotel and would stay there again if I went to Berlin. I would have to recommend the San Marino Italian restaurant as somewhere to eat locally - really…"
7457,I enjoyed the amazing service front desk provided throughout the entire stay. The hotel room was somewhat small however the windows in both the bedroom and bathroom really helped make it feel bigger. Breakfast was always great in the mornings and location was awesome! I would absolutely stay in this hotel again.
7458,"Almost five hours have passed and we are still waiting to check into our room.  The hotel lobby is filled with exhausted travelers in the same boat.  Staff claim their computer system has been down for THREE days!  What type of corporation forces their staff to work under these conditions with no idea of when the reservation system is coming back up?  With a big conference hosted here, how was the problem not fixed the same day?  This is HORRIBLE customer service!  As an elite member, I’ve never experienced any treatment this awful with a total disregard for a customer’s comfort.  Staff are more rude than apologetic and did not offer ANYTHING to make guests more comfortable, not even a glass of water.   Never again."
7459,"Great location.  Just minutes from the u-bahn.  Adequate room which was comfortable.  Bath is smalland shower is not made for a large person.  Excellent breakfast in the hotwl restaurant.  Friendly and knowledgeable staff.  Wifi is shaky at times, but overall is satisfactory.  We enjoyed our stay."
7460,"The staff here are really good, very sweet, approachable and speak good English. They are the only reason I've rated this hotel more than 1 star. The breakfast is also quite good but there needs to more vegetarian options and some labelling of vegetarian items, as some things such as coleslaw that you wouldn't expect to have meat in do.  The food in the restaurant however is very poor and very expensive for Vietnam.  I've tried several dishes as my mum got Ill whilst we were here and couldn't go much further.  The Salads are tiny and the tuna salad contains about 1/10th of a can of cheap tuna. The pasta is undercooked, the sauce bland. The bread used for sandwiches is stale and I've found several hairs in my meals and again there's about two vegetarian options on the menu.  The…"
7461,"The Max Brown Hotel Museum Square is located in the museum quarter, less then 5 min walking to the Van Gogh and Rijks museums. The rooms are tiny. The breakfast rather limited. Very close to the tram and bus stop."
7462,"Modern hotel in the northern part of Barcelona. Good rooms and facilities, although the room top pool is small. Rambla de Poblenou is at 50 meters from the hotel and offers a nice variety of Spanish life without too much tourists"
7463,"Hotel was clean, fresh and modern. Staff were polite and spoke good English. We had a tiny issue with our shower which they sorted out immediately and this impressed us. Rooms were cleaned to a wonderful standard daily and an array of mini toiletries were available for us to use.  The hotel is ideally located on a small side road leading off from Las Ramblas so the location was beyond perfect (although the hotel is not on the nicest of streets so you need to press a buzzer to get in and there is security at night).  The hotel is secure though and felt very very safe. The only downfall to the hotel was the heating. It was very cold in Barcelona during our stay and the heating was a noisy blow heater from the ceiling... but for most months this wouldn't be needed - especially not…"
7464,"Very helpful hosting us when NH Berlin Mitte sent us there for the night. I guess it was good NH teamwork. Room was clean, modern, quiet, and generous breakfast buffet. Next moring a cab brought us back to initial hotel."
7465,"As a frequent guest at Fraser properties worldwide, I held great expectation for this one in Shanghai, and I was duly disappointed.   For one thing, the front desk staff seem inadequately trained and are insensitive to travellers' needs. Official check in time is 14:00. We arrived at 16:45 almost 3 hours after check in time, and our room was still not ready. Receptionist simply said - without a single word of apology - that previous guests were too messy and thus took long time to clean the unit. As if it is ""perfectly normal"" to hold up a guest way past check-in time. In return breakfast for 2 for a one-day was offered. This completely disrupted my plans for that evening, and I was forced to wait until 18:00 to enter the room.    Then, our luggage was missing, contrary to the…"
7466,"Ideal for shorter visits.  Rooms are on the small side but well appointed with all the expected facilities. Clean and trendy furnishings make this a comfortable stay.  A good shower helps to! Wifi is good,  so ideal to work from.  The Ubahn is just 2mins away so good for getting around and there's some decent restaurants up the road.  Staff are fine although the German efficiency can be mistaken for rudeness by some.  Get over it.  For the price, this is as good as it gets.  Great value!  "
7467,"Booked 2 rooms (one for me, one for my sister), one river view and one city view room, expecting the Vinpearl quality. Just had horrible issues from there on..  Our river view room bathtub had dark red blood like stains which we had to raise twice with management were deemed as ""chemical stains"" and took over an hour to finally have our room changed at 11pm. We were initially moved to a city view room before being moved again to a river view room on a different level.   The city view room shower drain was not working so every time you would shower the entire bathroom would flood. Were informed it was a ""minor inconvenience"" but this time we were not offered to be relocated.   The service at the pool bar was extremely slow, at times taking over 20 minutes to order a beer. The…"
7470,"After a dreadful flight where both my daughter and i were sick, it would be nice to lay down on a nice soft bed. Boy was i wrong, the bed was as soft as a concrete slab. Furthermore, the room itself was super small. Pictures on website were deceiving. However, It is centrally located, close to city and many attractions. The staff were lovely and even got some medicine from the pharmacy for us as there were road blockages due to the taxi strike. It was costly though. In the morning we had toast, pricey toast and got a private hotel car for a 5 minute drive to our next generation for the sum of 50 euros. The most disappointing aspect was the bed and the room size. "
7471,"From Hotel America it's about a 3 minute walk to the beach.  That was one of the main reasons I chose to stay here.  Also, it's not very expensive, like some of the hotels nearby.  The location is excellent; you can walk to the old town, the port, the main shopping street, markets, and the beach!!  The hotel is in excellent condition; looks like it was refurbished recently.  The staff are great also.....very friendly and welcoming!  The rooms are a little small.......but who cares, you won't want to spend much time inside when everything is just outside.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone, and will be returning there myself!"
7473,"Stayed there for six nights. The hotel is located at Leblon beach. Apart from the location, the rooms and the hotel in general were rather disappointing. The decor of the rooms is extremely dull and substandard for the price we paid. The hotel seems to be undergoing a major renovation, so I suggest to wait until this is done. Great views from the roof though."
7474,"Stayed in Honeymoon Petra in summer 2005. Excellent place, spectacular view, outstanding & friendly & helpful service, comparable large pool & surroundings. However, the rooms - or at least some of the rooms - are far below the standard to be expected - clearly not 4 star but rather two star. Well, the ""James Bond"" style of the sixties might still look well if it would have been renovated recently. Check the pics. The place is highly recommended to go to for couples (not a place for families with kids - to steep stairs etc.); and Santorino is probably the Greek island with by far the best restaurants. But ask for a new / renovated room (I hope they do have them)... "
7475,"I tried booking at this hotel but ended up cancelling my reservation a month in advance.  Through booking.com I had free cancellation until 3 days to arrival but they ended up charging me anyway!  I tried speaking to Ingrid in sales and she was beyond rude and very condescending.  I even tried reaching out to Venecia the general manager, and she refused to email me back.  I just got back my refund from this terrible place, and I would seriously advise you to look elsewhere.  There's nothing worse than dealing with rude, disrespectful staff that are NOT willing to help you.  I hope this place gets shut down for their terrible customer service.  A bunch of thieves!"
7476,"Clean hotel but small. This is not for luxury but convenience. The location is great, as it’s close to a metro station and the Arc Di Triomf. We got there at 8 am and got early check in so that was great. However on one of the nights we found out that the electricity was off until 5 am and the hotel does not have a back up system for light ..."
7477,although the location is great and the lobby impressive the wows stopped there. Given a room key after a fairly confusing check in  - i was greeted by people already in my room - this garnered me a free coffee but no room upgrade. the room i had was fine - barely clean but fine. Utilizing the concierge was slightly challenging and time consuming and it was quicker to just try and figure it out myself. the buffet was deent but the room so depressing and the gym always so busy and sweaty. overall not impressed
7478,"We stayed here for 2 nights, very clean and tidy with helpful staff. Very close to bars and restaurants and good access to the rest of Berlin. We had the superior room which had a very tight stairway to the bedroom, not suitable for older or larger people."
7479,"Supposed upgrade but not given what we paid for and left in an outdated room. Wasn’t very clean, found this massive hair stuck to the shower wall. Not great for a supposed 5 star hotel. Bad layout of entry to rooms with extra door with no doorbell so family couldn’t knock door, very annoying. My upgrade that I didn’t ask for and not was I asked what I wanted) was basically waking up to a noisy fridge from the seventies, a cooker (I came on holiday to get away from cooking), and a balcony overlooking a neighbouring tower rather than a bay view I booked.   The bath is very tired with yellow dirty looking outlets. Room keys are still swipe ones which often fail because of being near a phone that 99.9% of people carry nowadays  Tried to charge 25 dollars for an umbrella on the…"
7480,"Five others & myself stayed for a three night weekend at this city centre hotel. We found this hotel well placed for a sightseeing holiday being within walking distance of many of the historic sites of Berlin. It is located adjacent to the the tourist areas, but still remained resonabliy quite at nigthtime.  The hotel is quite new, being built to the rear of an original waterside property, the main entrance is on the road at the rear. The rooms are well appointed with all things you would expect of a modern city centre hotel. But more drawer space would be better even for a weekend visit. The bar was very accommodating, not cheap, but what capital city bars are.The bar also doubles up for dining in the evening, serving food until  11.00 pm, ideal for our late arrival.  Breakfast…"
7481,"I'm familiar with the Holiday Inn Express, I have seen a few to know what you can and cannot expect from it. Just basic bed and breakfast with no extra frills which goes the same for this hotel. Location is great, hotel is very trendy on the inside, rooms are very clean and they do have rooms available with a view on the river. The hotel is close to the city center which is in walking distance. Unfortunately .. when it comes to their staff .. they just need to learn that the language Portuguese is not a very unique language in the sense that few words of their vocabulary is quit similar to other languages. And if they do decide to talk about their guest behind their backs, in front of their faces, they should do it when the guests are actually gone and not still standing in…"
7482,"Our stay at Hotel Comete Paris was perfect. Good location with easy access to the public transport, nicely decorated interior, good breakfast and very friendly and professional staff. Highly recommended "
7483,"Lovely, comfortable hotel with a great location and quite reasonably priced for Barcelona. However, when we stayed here at the end of Sept construction was being completed in BOTH adjoining buildings. Needless to say, it was very noisy. We were eventually moved (and upgraded) after some miscommunications with the front desk staff, but it took a bit of arguing and convincing. Also, what's up with the grey walls? It's kind of depressing, especially with so little natural light coming in."
7484,"Closely located to the transport network (metro and tramj. The room was comfy and clean and the breakfast was good.  Our twin room was a little on the small side, we had two single beds and it was comfortable but the size of the room meant that it was quite tight to move around the beds. This was fine for our stay (we were only really in the room to sleep) but may not suit everyone.  Plenty of hot water and very clean. A good breakfast spread- although the timings could be improved as we missed breakfast as the service was 8-10 and we were picked up before this for a day trip to Sintra (although in fairness we didn’t request an earlier breakfast so I’m not sure if that is an option)."
7486,"I had the pleasure of again stay at this wonderful hotel. The staff is polite and friendly, helpful and informative. The location is perfect, close to the Croisette and Rue D'Antibes. As a returning customer I simply love this magnificent hotel. My personal favorites are the studio apartments at Hotel Victoria, spaceous and modern. I give this hotel a well deserved five stars, I can highly recommend this hotel."
7487,"Room and location were ok. We had ocean side view. Hotel hasn’t been updated in over 4 years.  Our credit card was hacked and over $6,000 was charged to it.  The only people,who had the card for an extended amount of time were the people of Diamond Resort International who will try to hard sell you a time share.  Watch out - they are very dishonest.  I’m sure there are more trustworthy and honest places to stay. Food is mediocre - nothing special."
7488,"We stayed in this hotel on two separate nights at the beginning and end of our holidays.  The first stay was good, comfortable interconnecting club rooms,  very good breakfast and a good recommendation for our restaurant for dinner.  The second stay was a disaster.  As we checked out the first time we were told we would have the same rooms as we had stayed in before.  We arrived expecting this.  It wasn't an auspicious start when we had to wait 45 minutes for our rooms to be ready.  When we were finally shown them, they were not inter-connecting which we had booked and confirmed several times prior to our visit.  Reception seemed bewildered and kept muttering about their systems. When I said we had been promised the rooms we had on our previous stay this was flatly rejected as a…"
7489,"First its a 14 room pension house not a resort. It has a nice swimming pool. The desk man or maybe owner Kosmos is nice and friendly. We booked a 5 nights double room and it's obvious we're couple but what we get is two single beds! Upper floor though so we have the best view if the sea in our balcony. The next day we tried to get double room cos my  husband and I just doesn't like it when we are sleeping separately. But no there is no available double room hahaha. The bed feels like been used and slept for 5 years as it is thin and very un comfortable on your back.the owner shouldn't over sell it on the website as it mislead guests. The spa is the jacuzzi next to the pool though its nice enough to enjoy sun  it is not the nice pampering  massage and facial ""resort spa that you…"
7490,"We stayed as a family at this hotel. It's a beautiful hotel and the rooms are very nice and relaxing. But be warned, we had paid for a deluxe suite and upon arrival were put in the furthest location away from the reception. It was a very long walk. The room was not what we were expecting or had paid for. When I called the front desk I was told it was the suite I paid for and it was correct. I went online and double checked against what I paid for and should be expecting in the room. Ie there was no hair dryer, no bath, no bathrobe or slippers and no lounger on the balcony. Now all of this is not so much a problem but when I ask and the staff is clearly lying about the type of room we are in, it's not acceptable. Two times I called them and upon both occasions was told it was the…"
7491,"The hotel has a perfect location. The beds are comfortable, the bed linen of high quality, the breakfast is generous and served until 11.30, a big advantage. But my room was dreary, with one small window facing the courtyard, even though I had avoided to cheapest category to avoid this kind of room. I was given another room for the second night, somewhat brighter, but still worn and dated. These rooms are even fitted before the advent of mobile phones. You had to creep on the floor to find a socket. Renovation due. Of course the hotel cannot be blamed for the general price level on autumn weekend nights in this ever more popular tourist destination, but the paying almost 200 € a night for this kind of room felt steep."
7492,"If you're on budget, the Lodge is an ideal place to stay in Stockholm. I was here with 3 friends to see U2. The service is very very poor though, the woman behind the counter charged us 80 SEK to print 4 tickets for the show (that is over 2 euros for 1 piece of paper). You'll have to share your room with others, which is, if you're used to some privacy, unpleasant.  It is ideal if you're a budget traveller, and want to visit the city, and NOT stay in your room."
7493,"I found the best deal at the time of IFA Berlin. Realy cheap rate -comparing other hotels during this peak season-, for the smallest room type, we were really impressed with the size of the room (it was much bigger than expected), especially the bathroom. Our economy room was facing the inner court, and it was quiet. We liked the underground unique cozy style of the hotel, enjoyed the cold buffet breakfast which is only 15€. Isabel at the front desk was so welcoming and always smiling. The location is superb!"
7494,"The building is a superb one, pretty nice gardens surrounding it, pool, spa and a beach. My real problem was with food. The quality of the food is very poor. Many time they served ‘feijoada’, it means, beans mixed with something else, sea-food, pork or other meats. The beans were, obviously canned, and, the looked uncooked, directly to the mix. The wine they served was the cheapest one found in the cheapest supermarket. Cakes and sweets, very bad quality, they look like supermarket made. Table of cheeses, again, only containing the cheapest ones.  Even though, you were in a nice restaurant, the food was worst than a canteen. The staff in the reception was not nice, they tried not to hear what you are saying to them, in order to make what they want. As a customer, I felt, they…"
7496,"I stayed here as part of a 3 day family trip to Amsterdam. The location was the main deciding factor, it’s allot cheaper and quieter than central Amsterdam and you are directly opposite Sloterdijk station where you can get a train to the centre of town in 5 minutes and the airport in 10. Dutch public transport certainly shows up the UK. As for the hotel it’s clean, modern and the rooms were of a decent size. I upgraded to the privilege room which is not really worth doing, the rooms are the same as the basic room but all you get is a bathrobe, slippers and soft drinks in the mini bar. I generally slept ok but did find the room a bit chilly sometimes.  My sleep was also disturbed one night by an inconsiderate neighbour seemingly having a party and playing Cher at top volume…"

We had 2 rooms on the third floor (with balcony) and we had the city view. We had a room on the corner of the building, it was larger than the standard room our sons had.

The guy from reception who came to check the situation coud not smell anything. Strange strange - but they said they were fully booked and could not put me into a different room. A colleague who stayed next door, had a similar smell - but not as strong - in his room.  Took a quick shower after a long day travelling - and trying to get dinner, the hotel restaurant closed (11pm). Bad luck! In walking distance, we´ve not found anything decent.   Coming back at around 1am, I found out that the internet  - which…"
